# Articles Classification - Tutorial/Not Tutorial

This is an exercice I did during a recruitement process for a startup called Feedly base in San Fransisco.<br><br>

### Overview:
The objectif of the exercice is to predict wether a text article is a tutorial or not using a binary classifier.<br>
The articles dataset used for both training and evaluation is ```dataset_tutorials.json```.<br>
The ipython notebook ```articles.classification``` contains all the work including an exploratory data analysis of the dataset, the resolution of the classification task and the evaluation of different classifiers.<br><br>

There is a nice pdf version of the notebook as well.
